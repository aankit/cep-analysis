Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Members of our school staff are perpetual learners, taking the opportunity for continuous weekly professional 
development and collaboration. We focus these learning opportunities on planning and preparation that will lead to 
increased student engagement and time on task. Our teachers are trained in understanding and writing strength 
based IEP's. Partnered with ongoing assessments, this enables our staff to meet the needs of all of our students and 
their learning styles. Furthermore, we partner with a community based organization that brings tutors into our school 
that help support student academic growth, and sends students to camp to enhance social emotional growth. 

Our school utilizes a multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) for both academic (Response to Intervention- RTI) and 
behavior (Positive Behavior Intervention Support- PBIS) interventions, in order to meet the needs of our students. For 
students in need of additional behavioral interventions, we offer secondary and tertiary levels of support through our 
Pupil Personnel Team. We also utillize out-patient services throughout our school community for more intensive 
mental health, behavioral, and family supports.  

Our students take ownership in their learning community through participation in the P169 School Council. They also 
partake in class trips and academic celebrations, which help support and showcase their hard work. Families are 
encouraged to join in the school community through participation in parent workshops, the School Leadership Team, 
and academic celebrations that will help foster a strong partnership between home and school. Our alternate sites 
create a language rich learning environment using a multi-tiered approach to increase our students' independent 
skills. Participation from all members of our school community is an integral part of creating a positive, sustainable 
school culture.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Robert F. Kennedy is an elementary, middle, high school with 361 students from grade K through 12. The school 
population comprises 43% Black, 50% Hispanic, 4% White, and 1% Asian students. The student body includes 12% 
English language learners and 100% special education students. Boys account for 82% of the students enrolled and 
girls account for 18%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 87.4%.  

P169M provides a highly stimulating instructional environment, utilizing a wide variety and range of age-appropriate 
incentives, where students with special needs are encouraged to realize their individual potential.  

Each of our students strives to find the less restrictive setting that will meet their needs. They strive to return to a 
General Education setting. We seek to provide the opportunities and resources that will allow our students to prosper 
and successfully interact in school, the home and community.  

Our school is dedicated to providing our diverse student population with a meaningful educational experience in a 
safe and challenging environment. It is our goal to move our students along a path that will help them to realize their 
educational and social potential, while providing opportunities that are structured to promote successful experiences. 
Through these structured activities students will acquire the characteristics associated with good citizenship.  

We intend to bring together diverse media (text, sound, pictures and video), strive to draw upon children’s natural

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Areas of celebration include three of the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools. These include Rigorous 
Instruction, Collaborative Teachers and Effective School Leadership. The following are excerpts from our 2015 Quality 
Review: P.169 is Well-Developed in ensuring engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a 
variety of learners and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards.  

P.169M is Well-Developed in establishing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations to staff, 
students and families, and provide supports to achieve those expectations.  

Our area of focus falls within the element of a Supportive Environment as it refers to teacher feedback so that 
students may make optimal gains across all curriculum areas. Our 2015 Quality Review states : P.169M area of focus - 
Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze information on student 
learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

All curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and strategically integrate the instructional shifts for all 
learners. Teachers across grades and content areas use student work and data to refine curricula so that all students are 
engaged in challenging learning experiences. Our strategic curricular decisions result in rigorous tasks and learning 
experiences promoting college and career readiness for all learners across grades and content areas. Multiple entry 
points are regularly planned to provide access to curricula and cognitively engage all learners.  

Our school’s use of Ready Gen in K-2 and School wide 3-8 ELA curriculum and Go Math and Connect Mathematics 
provide students in standardized assessment classes with exposure to rigorous tasks and learning activities aligned to 
the Common Core Learning Standards. The ELA Curriculum Framework identifies formative assessment tasks and 
differentiated learning activities that support student access to an appropriately challenging final performance 
assessment.  

At the start of the 2017-2018 school year, P.169M was identified as a Local Assistance Plan (LAP) school. The school was 
identified as a LAP school in the areas of ELA and Mathematics for Grades 3-8 in standardized assessment. In developing 
a school goal to address student performance in Math and ELA, school leaders and staff analyzed an array of data

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

Positive based interventions and supports (PBIS) is the driving force which unifies all sites of P169M. Students and 
teachers strive towards creating a positive learning community which teaches behavioral expectations, provides 
reinforcement for appropriate behaviors, and consistent consequences when needed. The KARMA behavior 
management system is used at each of our sites in order to teach, model and track behavioral progress of our students. 
KARMA is an acronym for the following: Kind, Appropriate, Respectful, Mature and Accountable. Each symbolizes a set 
of behavioral expectations across settings (classroom, lunchroom, hallway, gym, etc,). These expectations, along with 
Emotional Literacy, are posted in all classrooms and taught to our students in order to maximize their behavioral 
development. A variety of programs are available to assist with teaching expectations, creating a positive learning 
community and developing community oriented students/staff. By focusing on positive behavior, we foster a climate 
which reinforces appropriate behavior and moves our students towards returning to community schools if that is their 
goal. It allows our students to develop maturity and independence while accepting personal responsibility for their 
academic, behavioral and personal success.  

P. 169M has been designated as a LAP school. Analysis of student SWIS and OORS data indicates that students in Grades 
5-8 have challenges in attending to academic tasks for extended periods of time; this in turn impacts on their academic

skills progression in mathematics and ELA. School leaders and staff have determined that priority areas of focus for 
students in Grades 5-8 in both standardized and alternate assessment should be on increasing stamina with regard to 
academic tasks and staying in location during academic periods. Accordingly, there is a need to increase emphasis on 
engaging instruction, student attendance to academic tasks in ELA and Mathematics and remaining in location. As a 
result of rigorous data analysis, the school has determined that there is a need to refine and adjust the current 
behavioral system for the students in Grades 5-8 in standardized and alternate assessment. The adjustments will 
provide increased opportunities for immediate recognition of students staying on task and staying in location. The 
school also will continue to involve parents as key partners in supporting student behavior that results in increased 
academic gains. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

All teachers are involved in consistently analyzing student work, assessment data, instructional practices and curricula 
within structured professional collaborations. Established leadership structures and a culture of shared accountability 
are in place and promoted at the school. The work of teacher teams has resulted in improved teacher pedagogy and 
increased student achievement. Distributed leadership structures have afforded teachers opportunities to build 
leadership capacity and share in decision-making processes relevant to student learning and achievement.  

Teachers collaborate in professional teams where they analyze student work and data to develop and refine practices 
within a grade or discipline. In the team meetings, teachers used multiple sources of data, including student reading 
levels, curriculum mid- and end- unit assessments in math and English language arts, student progress toward meeting 
Individualized Educational Plan goals, SANDI and FAST assessments. Curriculum Framework, units of study and lesson 
plans are evidence of team planning aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and highlight the instructional 
shifts, resulting in curricular coherence across grades and disciplines at all sites. Extensive professional learning for staff 
is shared at teacher team meetings and serves to strengthen pedagogical practices of teachers. School leaders provide 
time and substitutes for teachers to attend professional development outside of the school; structures are in place 
during teacher team meetings and Monday professional development for teachers to share what they have learned with 
their colleagues. Teachers develop comprehensive agendas for their team meetings and use protocols to analyze and 
"learn from" student work School leaders have distributive leadership structures in place that build teacher capacity and 
allow teachers to have input in strategic decision making. Unit coordinators meet with the data specialist once monthly

School leadership has determined the need for increasing the school emphasis on writing instruction across all content 
areas in all sites. School leadership will leverage resources to ensure that teachers are provided with appropriate 
professional development in the area of planning and preparation. Teachers will also have opportunities to share writing 
samples with their colleagues in teacher team meetings. School leaders will collaboratively plan professional 
development on writing instruction, strategies for increasing student skills in writing, scoring of writing samples, and 
analysis of student work. Teachers will also be provided with opportunities to review student assessments that require 
writing and collaboratively analyze the skills students need to develop, 

P. 169 was designated as a LAP school. Analysis of standardized assessments indicate a need to teach students how to 
plan and structure their writing assignments. Student skills in writing have not supported their performance in 
standardized writing assessments. There is also a need to increase student use of academic vocabulary in writing. 

School leaders will also ensure that there are multiple scheduled opportunities for celebration and sharing of student 
work.

Families are excited about several opportunities that we offer to students and families. Learning does not end at the last 
bell here at P.169M as we offer after-school academic and physical education programs. The CHAMPS Middle School 
Sports and Fitness League is an initiative of the New York City Department of Education that promotes student physical 
activity during the critical years of middle school. The name CHAMPS derives from the initials of the five characteristics 
that describe our participants: Cooperative, Healthy, Active, Motivated and Positive Students. Additionally, students in 
middle school can receive additional academic instruction as part of the Chancellor’s After-School Initiative, MSAS. 
Additionally as our students engage in Cookshop, our Families engage in Cookshop for Families. Once a month our 
Parent Coordinator in collaboration with our Unit Coordinators gather our parents to participate in creating a healthy 
and cost effective meal. 

Additionally, our Parent Coordinator is aligned with the Parent Coordinators of the Manhattan District 75 schools as 
they hold monthly Parent Workshops that are formulated based upon parent interest.

P.169M is a school consisting of a Main Site and 4 off-sites. One of the school practices that brings together the students 
and their families is the publication of a site specific monthly newsletter. Common attributes of this newsletter include 
students with top attendance percentages and PBIS outstanding achievers. Newsletters are sent to all families. 

A Celebration! Newsletter is sent home monthly that compiles best practices across all of our sites contained in one 
Newsletter. In this way, as student’s transition to other sites, parents already have a familiarity with that site. 

NYCCC (New York City Children’s Center) is a Mental Health Agency that operates in our Main school building and 
presently provides services to 40 of our students and their families. The goal is for them to be able to provide services 
for 60 students. These services are directed at improving student’s mental health so that academic achievement can be 
improved. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase in parent/family participation in P169M parent/teacher conferences, events 
and trainings (focused on ELA, Math, Technology and Social Skills) as compared to parent participation in parent/teacher 
conferences, school based events and trainings during the 2017-2018 school year.

Cookshop for families provides an opportunity for parents to come 
to the school once a month to learn about the healthy foods that 
their children are also learning about in school. Parents come 
together working with the Parent Coordinator and Unit Coordinator 
of the site. Parents take this opportunity to network with other 
parents as well as learn strategies to introduce new items to their 
special needs students. 

K-3 

Conduct Parent Workshops to model to parents how they can teach 
academic, cell phone use and social skills at home. 

K-8 

All teachers have a system of parent communication which provides 
daily, weekly and monthly information concerning student progress 
in instructional, behavioral and attendance information. 
Additionally, teachers use their parent outreach time on the 
extended Tuesday afternoons to communicate with parents to 
foster their involvement in their child's school.

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS

All counselors reach out to the families identified as being in temporary housing. We update our database to include 
families that are transitioning to permanent housing. All students and their families are assisted with items from our 
food, clothing and toiletries pantry. Counselors stay after school to assist parents in picking up items discreetly. They 
are given a metro card for transportation.  

In addition, we provide Board Maker, an academic program, for our alternate assessment students to facilitate 
communication of their needs both at school and at home with their families. In addition, this program is also used to 
communicate environmental and social emotional changes to our alternate assessment students.  

 

3. Some Non-Title I schools receive a specific allocation based on the reported number of students living in temporary 
housing.  If your school received an allocation (please refer to the current Title I Funds Summary of School Allocation 
Memorandum), include the amount your school received in this question.  If your school did not receive an allocation 
and needs assistance in identifying resources to assist STH students, please contact an STH liaison.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           39 

 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 169M, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

The school's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school's Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school's Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.

environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.;

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school's Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school's educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Begin description here:            
Begin description here:   P169M will run a Title lll ENL after school instructional program 
entitled Effective Communication in the school and in the Community Environment serving 6 
students in grades K-2, in a 6:1:1 class with one ENL teacher, one paraprofessional, and one 
supervisor collaborating in and overseeing the program.  The class will meet for two and a half 
hours a day, Wednesdays and Thursdays, five hours a week, from 2:45 PM to 5:15 PM for a total 
of 50 hours (20 sessions, 10 weeks) beginning in late January and go through late March.  The 
program will take place at our P.169M @ Midtown East site.  The regular school hours for the 
site are 8:00AM - 2:20PM.  The program will function on Wednesday's and Thursday's from 
2:45PM - 5:15PM.  The regular hours of the supervisor for this program is 7:30AM - 
3:15PM.  The class will be taught in English by a certified ENL teacher, and a special education 
teacher/supervising Assistant Principal,  who will use appropriate ENL methodologies and 
scaffolding techniques, supported by research, such as The natural approach (Krashen, S., 1985), 
TPR (Asher, J., 2003), the language experience approach (Wales, M.L., 1994), and Quality 
Teaching for English Language Learners (QTEL) scaffolds (Walqui, 2005).  Technology and 
problem solving will be infused into instruction to enhance student learning, and as a solution to 
the problem of access and equity for ELL'S-MLL'S with severe disabilities (Birnbaum, B., 
2003).  Instruction will address the Learning Standards. 
  
The rationale of instruction in the TItle lll After school Program at P169M is to provide 
additional support and opportunities for ELL -MLL students with Autism and Intellectual 
Disabilities to increase their listening, speaking/communication, reading, and writing skills in 
English as well as promote effective communication in the school and in the community. .  The 
NYSESLAT scores for these students indicate the students need more support in all modalities of 
expressive and receptive language.  Teachers will address the NYS ELA Common Core 
Learning Standards of listening, reading, writing, and speaking using informational texts through 
the use of laptop computers and software packages designed for our student population which 
includes "Writing with Symbols."  Also, teachers will use the language experience approach to 
deliver instruction that is differentiated, thematic, and that affords students an opportunity to 
generalize, apply, and put their skills into practice across content areas and in a  variety of 
situations, as suggested by the New York State Education's Office of English Language Learners 
in their resource book entitled, "New Language Arts Progressions".  We will also further ADL 
skills, cooking and communication skills through JARS (Joint Action Routine) and Sounds in 
Motion.   We wil also use google minis to enhance language deevelopment.   The TItle lll After

school program will support and supplement Part 154 instruction delivered during the school day 
by providing additional language-learning  support to students that will benefit them in their 
academic, recreational and behavioral/socialization programs.  The use of technology like I pads 
and computers will be used to enhance their education.  The theme of the After school program 
as stated above, will be Effective Communication in the School and in the Community 
Environment, and will include instruction which is heavily weighted with language which is 
needed in the community and in school.  The students will learn to search and navigate 
instruction on the computer and negotiate purchasing supplies at the community stores.  They 
also will develop a facility for the use of boardmaker-Mayer-Johnson symbols.  The language of 
instruction will be in English.  The New Language Arts Progressions will be used.

resource kit to enhance staff preparation and planning for instruction of ELL'S-MLL'S  and 
thereby improving student communication skills necessary for success in their current academic 
setting, not only in the After school Title lll program but also for Stand Alone and Integrated 
ENL provided for students during the school day. This professional development initiative is 
aligned to the instructional After school Academy program and will provide technical support 
and resources to staff in the After school program, Tuesdays from 3:40 to 5:10 p.m. commencing 
in  late January and ongoing through the TItle lll program for 6 sessions.  The study group format 
of our planned professional development is in alignment with research findings that equate 
successful professional development and the application of what is learned during PD to the 
classroom setting, and offering teachers the opportunity to take on leadership roles in their own 
ongoing training (Galbraith, P. & Anstrom, K., 1995), as well as supported by the Action 
Research Process and teacher-initiated/led action research and implementation (Sagor, ASCH, 
2000).  The title lll study group will meet for a total of nine hours on Tuesdays.  The staff will 
read chapters of Teaching Autism  in advance, and respond to questions formulated by the ENL 
Teacher on the tenets of the book.   The topics to be discussed, which are aligned to the Title lll 
program, will include:  Standards-based instruction (CCLS) in the content areas for writing 
purposes;  Using the Language Experience Approach to understand informational texts; How to 
teach students to generalize, apply and synthesize skills; What does it mean to effectively 
communicate in the school environment, and how is this imparted to students?; Supporting 
academic language using visuals, regalia and manipulatives; Supporting appropriate language 
and behavior in the classroom and community.  We will also be using Teaching 
Autism:  Strategies to Enhance Communication and Socialization by Kathleen Ann Quill, 1995,

Begin description here:            
 
  The Title lll orientation for parents took  place during Parent/Teacher conferences in November 
at 1:00 and 5:00 p.m.  Parents were informed of the proposed Title lll program and had their 
questions regarding the program answered.  Parents were called and notified in writing, in their 
native language about the Title lll After school support program. Parents were invited to attend 
the Title lll Program with their child.  Parents will be encouraged to take this opportunity to 
familiarize themselves with the educational technology available to their children in order to 
support their children in  self-regulation, learning appropriate responses to social situations, and 
to reinforce learning.  Parents will also receive literature for their personal use.  On 5 Mondays 
during the Title 111 program, the ENL Teacher and Supervisor will provide five,  two hour 
workshops at the end of the school day to parents. The topics will be focused on communication 
skills and controlling behavior and exposing children to the world around them, common core 
learning standards, curriculum and testing preparation.  We will be using "Helping Children to 
Improve their Communication Skills- Therapeutic Activities.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
   Our school uses SANDI and FAST which helps us to properly group our students and informs our instruction. The SANDI 
results determine a hierarchy of developmental/academic proficiency. The SANDI assesment is a Common Core aligned skill 
assesment that supports the development of student PLOPS and eventual IEP goals. Within all the assesments, strengths and 
weaknesses are identified.  Both formal and informal assesments conducted provide a comprehensive profile of the individual 
student which will determine instructional focus and teaching objectives.  Quantitative data is taken and analyzed during 
teacher cohort meetings.  The trend is slowly improving over time. Over 70% of our alternate assesment students have

remained in the"beginner/entering" cohort and have had challenges moving forward due to the moderate to severe cognitive 
delays.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
   We evaluate the succcess of our ELL program in a variety of ways.  Movement torwards  "proficient/commanding"  on State 
tests (NYSESLAT) are monitored.  Student's success is determined through the acquisition of skills as demonstrated in their 
portfolio and NYSESLAT results. This information is analyzed and used to drive instructional choices. Instructional adjustments 
are made according to the student's needs.  Based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores, a data pattern has proven that the 
reading and listening skills are the student's strengths.  In addition, more support is needed in the reading and writing 
modalities.  At every grade level, this pattern has been displayed.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Struggling ELL students are identified during data review/cohort meetings.  Student program effectiveness is assesed and 
modified at this time. Students who are identified at this time will receive increased academic intervention services including 
but not limited to, Homework help, tutoring, and participation in our Title III program.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
    NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data indicate that the majority of our ELLs are placed at the beginner level in all of our grade 
levels.  NYSESLAT scores inform both the choice of materials and our program models. Students with the most significant 
developmental delays show the least progress when measured using the NYSESLAT.  Due to the level of disability of some 
students, they were  unable to answer NYSESLAT questions resuling in a (NSC) no score.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

English as a new language (ENL): formerly known as English as a second language (ESL); research based-program 
comprised of (1) content area instruction in English with home language supports and appropriate scaffolds, and (2) 
an English language development component. ENL is delivered through a stand-alone model or integrated ENL.  
• Stand-alone English as a new language is an ENL delivery model in which students receive instruction in order to 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           55 

 

 

acquire the English language needed for success in core content courses. A student cannot receive stand-alone 
English as a new language in lieu of core content area instruction. 
• Integrated ENL (see above for definition of ENL) is an ENL delivery model in which students receive core content 
area (i.e., English language arts, math, science, or social studies) and English language development instruction from a 
dually certified teacher or two certified teachers. 
English language learner subgroup or subpopulation: because ELLs are not a monolithic group but rather have 
different linguistic and academic needs, there are categories to better identify their needs. The categories are 
newcomer, developing, long-term, students with disabilities, students with inconsistent/interrupted formal education 
(SIFE), and former.  
Home language arts (HLA): formerly known as native language arts (NLA); a unit of study or its equivalent in language 
arts in the student’s home language. Such units of study are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards.  
Language Assessment Battery-Revised (LAB-R): former assessment used to determine ELL status

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              Students receiving ENL instruction are clustered together  in classes to maximize minutes provided by ENL 
teachers.   ENL teacher integrated model is designed to maximize student minutes served. The ENL Stand Alone model is 
designed to group children based on profficiency levels  to maximize teaching objectives.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Integrated ENL teaching models are collaborative models with classes that use themeatic/curriculum appoaches that 
are CCLS aligned.  Stand alone models use a variety of instructional approaches all of which are focused on individual learner's 
documented reading levels and targeted NYSESLAT skills.  Our overall approach is to allow access to learning material by 
adapting these materials to meet individual needs.  The instructional strategies used include Total Physical Response (TPR), 
Language Experience, Whole Language, Multi Sensory Approach and Pictorial/ Symbolic representations in conjunction with 
Augmentative Communication Devices.  These devices are programmed so that children can respond to a variety of stories, 
therefore ensuring compliance with NYS, English Language arts Progressions.  The use of bilingual software and multimedia 
(such as boardmaker) enhances and supports the development of native language skills. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 
                 Alternate placement paraprofessionals  support the teacher made native language instructional 
assesments.  Teaching directives are translated to ensure student understanding and to assess language dominance and 
student progress in their native language.

a.) SIFE students are afoorded increased 1:1 intensive instruction. Symbols including Picture Exchange Symbols (PECS), graphic 
organizers and differentiated instruction that are in Native Language as well as in English. SIFE students are encouraged to 
attend our Title III program for additional support and academic intervention.  
b.) Newcomers are assesed and are afforded increased 1:1 intensive instruction. This supports the acquisition of many pre-
requisites needed for learning.  Similar differentiation models are used for the newcomer including intensive vocabulary 
instruction, immersion, sight words and graphic organizers.  The Paraprofessional provides additional differentiation. 
Newcomers are encouraged to attend our Title III program for additional support and academic intervention. 
c&d.)  long term ELL (4-6 & 6+) receiving services; our certified ENL teachers consult with student's classroom teachers and 
related service providers to assess student performance in the four modalities of English Language Learning: 
listening,speaking, reading and writing.  The results of these discussions are then used to determine the most appropriate 
goals and performance indicators to be applied.  P169M follows the New York State English as a Second Language Standards 
and incorporates ENL strategies such as TPR (Total Physical Response), language experience, whole language, graphic 
organizers and cooperative learning. Scaffolded instruction is provided in all subjects.  Students instruction follows the same 
protocol as newcomer instruction.  ELLs in all of our subgroups are encouraged to attend our Title III programs for additional 
support and academic intervention. 
e.) ELLs testing proficient/commanding are eligible for an additional year of ENL support. This support includes scaffolding of 
materials, peer support and ongoing assesment.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
P169M has selected a variety of instructional programs to address the specific needs of ELL-SWDs.  Curriculum choices include 
the UNIQUE learning system, ATTAINMENT  which is a standards based curriculum for special education students.  It provides 
unit lessons plans with multiple entry access points with differentiated tasks to accommodate the diversity of learners with 
significant disabilities and is Common Core Aligned.  The curriculum that we use are all grade and age appropriate.  These 
materials accelerate English Language acquisition by providing targeted vocabulary specific to each subject area.  Teachers use 
Smart boards, Laptops, ipads to support ELLs by providing targeted imagery to re-enforce vocabulary.  Subgroups are paired 
with an appropriate Paraprofessional who works with them to ensure their continued progress. All of our ELLs are SWDs and 
the materials are grade and age appropriate as described above.  Our school has a team that includes the School Psychologist, 
Principal, teacher, related service providers who meet to ensure that all mandated services are provided.  At the beginning of 
each school year, the LPT meets to determine who the ELL students are, their level of language proficiency based on the 
NYSITELL and or NYSESLAT results and are given the appropriate ENL  minutes.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
           Students are selected to paricicipate in an ICT classroom based upon their achievent on their state exams, ELA Math and 
Science and NYSESLAT exam and their ability to work independently and thrive in a less restrictive environment.  Students in 
the ICT classroom have the same schedueling opportunities as non disabled peers.

Policy and Reference Guide, I, Susan Finn, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The School's Administrative Team, our bilingual Parent Coordinator, our ESL teachers, and our counseling staff 
reviewed the home language surveys of the entire student body as well as all school-to-home communications: 
written and logged-verbal, whether available in translation or not for the 2015-16 school year. Moreover, the 
entire IEP/CSE identification and remediation of needs process was reviewed to insure that families would be 
provided with all relevant information in their preferred language as required by Federal, State and Local statute 
and relevant case law.  
 

 
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64 

 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Percent Oral  

 

 

Language  

At this time, the languages 
(other than Engliish) 
needed for school-to-
home communication at 
P169M were found to be 
Spanish, Mandarin 
(Chinese)and Bengali. 
Teachers of students 
whose families are not 
English speaking are both 
informed and provided 
with contact information 
both in the school and at 
relevant community 
support services in order 
to insure adequate home-
school communication is 
effective and 
uninterrupted. Staff 
members fluent in Spanish 
and Chinese have received 
the required DOE training 
in translation and 
interpretive services. This 
information has been 
disseminated to all staff 
members who have need 
or desire to communicate 
with families. A summary 
of the requirements 
included in Chancellor's 
Regulations A-663 listed in 
the P169M Staff Handbook 
and will be included in the 
staff orientation before the 
beginning of each new 
school year.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at

staff will serve as translators to 
parents. Ongoing Iep conferences will 
occur and we may utilize the Language 
Translation and Interpretation

translate for the parents. Attendance 
teachers and guidance counselors will 
periodically interact with parents and 
may ask the Language Access 
Coordinator to translate or call the 
Language Translation and
