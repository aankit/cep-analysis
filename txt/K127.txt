Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The educational community of P.S. 127 is committed to our mission in ensuring that we provide a nurturing and 
supportive educational experience for each and every child. Our students are empowered to BELIEVE in themselves, 
ACHIEVE their fullest potential, and SUCCEED in meeting high standards of EXCELLENCE in order to be college and 
career ready. Our vision is that our school is a place where students, staff, and parents work together in a teaching 
and learning partnership. Every child is empowered to reach his/her highest potential and become happy, 
knowledgeable, and productive citizens of the 21st century. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

At P.S. 127, all members of the school community respect and value language and cultural diversity. Our student 
population is made up of 23.41% of English Language Learners and approximately 20.63% of students with special 
needs. The staff members of P.S. 127 are committed to planning for the academic and social-emotional growth of 
each child. With the Chancellor’s Four Pillars and the Citywide Instructional Expectations in mind, we strongly 
encourage parents and families to be active participants in their child’s education. At P.S. 127, there is an open door 
policy and there are many opportunities that foster our strong emphasis on “Parents as Partners”. Parents are actively 
involved in the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) and are visible daily as they engage in numerous activities that are 
essential in supporting our efforts towards the enhancement of student learning. Each class has a “Class Parent” who 
serves as a liaison between the classroom teacher and the students’ parents. Class Parents assist in facilitating 
classroom activities and events such as publishing parties, assemblies, and Dance Festival.  

Our Parent Coordinator is instrumental in promoting effective partnering with families and establishing a strong 
home-school connection. This focus has been embodied in our work and aimed at supporting students’ progress 
toward college and career readiness. Parents are invited to our school to celebrate in school-wide events and 
initiatives. Workshops are held for parents by teachers, support staff, and the Parent Coordinator based upon the 
needs of the parents. In addition, “ Time on Tuesdays ” allows staff members to meet with parents, call parents, work 
on monthly newsletters, update the school website, complete student progress reports, and conduct workshops. 
With an open door policy and transparency, parents feel welcomed and are enthusiastic to volunteer their time and 
attend workshops. We continuously strive to establish a culture of trust and build parent capacity as we share an 
understanding of the Learning and implementation of the Next Generation ELA and Mathematics Standards, 
Curriculum Expectations, Instructional Shifts, and the many ways we can prepare our children for future success.  

As we embrace a supportive environment and a strong home-school connection, we foster a school culture of high 
expectations. “Family Friday” is another opportunity for parents to actively participate in their child’s learning. There 
is open access to a parent room which is housed within our school building. Parents are able to sign in and use the 
computer, internet, and a variety of resources available for their review. A monthly newsletter, “McKinley Monthly”, 
is distributed to inform our school community of our instructional goals and the many wonderful activities that are 
taking place in each class/program. Student Progress Reports are distributed to parents/guardians as a way to provide 
ongoing communication regarding their child’s performance and progress. 

The School Leadership Team (SLT) is comprised of elected parents and staff members as well as the Principal, PTA 
President, and UFT Chapter Leader meet monthly to develop school-based educational policies and ensure that 
resources are aligned to implement those policies. The members of the SLT play a significant role in creating a 
structure for school-based decision making and shaping the path to a collaborative and successful school culture. 

Using a variety of assessment tools, such as periodic and benchmark assessments in both ELA and Math, Fountas and 
Pinnell running records, formative assessments (student/teacher conference notes) and teacher data folders to gain 
information of student understanding, the SLT as well as teacher teams identify an area of need. An Instructional 
Focus is derived from data analysis which then becomes the "big idea" of this school year's Inquiry work.  

Teacher teams work collaboratively throughout the school year to make a thoughtful assessment of the effectiveness 
of each lesson and the extent to which it achieved its instructional outcomes. They consistently seek opportunities to 
enhance learning and actively monitor the progress of individual students. Teachers reflect on their efforts to ensure 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

that they are providing focused, quality instruction and are committed to developing their content knowledge and 
pedagogical skills. 

The Instructional team which is comprised of representatives across grades and administration meets regularly to 
discuss the important concepts and understandings shared by each grade/program. During conversations about 
practice, the members of the Instructional Team plans for professional learning opportunities to meet the varied 
needs of the staff, develops interest and feedback surveys, and creates a solid annual professional development plan. 
Teachers share best practices and turn-key information gained from workshops. In addition to the data compiled from 
interest surveys, reports are generated from the Advance Observation Dashboard and are utilized as a tool to identify 
specific areas of pedagogical needs in accordance with the Framework for Professional Practice. As a result, 
differentiated professional development is planned accordingly. Professional goals are set by teachers at the 
beginning of the school year and are communicated during the Initial Planning Conferences. The attainment of these 
goals is benchmarked with a mid-year reflection meeting and at the end of the school year during the End of Year 
Summative Conferences. Professional goals are used as an additional resource when planning professional learning 
opportunities for individual staff members. 

As a result of the commitment to students and their learning, the administration, teachers, and staff take ownership 
and continually reflect on their efforts to ensure student success. They participate in on-going professional learning 
throughout the school year and are dedicated to enhancing their knowledge. For example, teachers have attended 
the Borough Field Support Center meetings, which addressed meeting the needs of all students, including English 
Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. Professional development experience sheets are completed and 
turn-key sessions take place in which staff members share their new learning with colleagues. Reflection sheets are 
completed regularly and used to adjust and plan further learning opportunities. 

Teaching strategies and routines provide multiple entry points as well as high-quality supports and extensions into the 
curricula so that all learners, including English Language Learners (ELLs) and Students with Disabilities (SWDs), are 
engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-order thinking skills in student work products. 
Teachers’ assessment practices consistently reflect the varied use of ongoing checks for understanding and student 
self-assessment so that teachers make effective adjustments to meet all students’ learning needs and students are 
aware of their next learning steps. 

Cycles of observations are conducted to monitor the implementation of strategies and professional growth. As a 
result of actionable feedback and ongoing support, there has been an increase in rigor and student engagement in all 
classrooms. Additionally, multiple sources of data including student work products and data folders indicate enhanced 
skills of teaching and improved student learning. School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the 
standards and strategically integrate the instructional shifts, resulting in coherence across grades and subject areas 
that promote college and career readiness for all students. Curricula and academic tasks consistently emphasize 
rigorous habits and higher-order skills across grades and subjects for all students, including ELLs and SWDs. 

In order for teachers to dig deeper into content and ensure academic rigor while addressing the instructional shifts, 
departmentalization for all core subject areas in grades 4 and 5 has been established. As a team, teachers and 
administration shared their ideas and beliefs about better preparing our students academically, professionally, and 
socially for future endeavors. Accordingly, planning sessions were held to departmentalize the upper grades in order 
to achieve deeper and more rigorous instruction and student learning. Transition from elementary to middle school 
and middle to high school has been more easily achieved with departmentalization. As a result of departmentalizing 
the 4th and 5th grades, students have been able to move more frequently during the school day which has helped 
increase attention and has allowed them to be more intellectually engaged in each of the content-based classrooms. 
It has allowed students to become better organized as they prepare for each class. Students in grades 4 and 5 have 
had the opportunity of learning from different teachers while gaining in-depth knowledge during each Math, Reading, 
Writing, Science, and Social Studies class. 

With the ability of having a full-time Guidance Counselor, P.S. 127 has been actively involved in many awareness 
campaigns that educate our students and sends a unified message. These campaigns teach our students about

citizenship, bullying prevention, and cybersecurity. Our Guidance Counselor works closely with the members of the 
Student Council to organize campaigns, special school events, and fundraisers throughout the school year. The 
students sponsor a “Cause a Month”. Student Council members promote school spirit and leadership among students. 
Members of the Student Council demonstrate leadership qualities by serving as good examples of behavior through 
their words and actions.  

We have been identified as a “Respect For All” school. “Respect for All” is engrained in our curriculum through the use 
of the Book of the Month and varied approaches to social emotional learning. The Book of the Month program uses a 
school-wide book each month that continues to be linked to the theme of CKCC in order to promote social-emotional 
growth of children, ways to deal with stress, anger, respect for differences, cultural diversity and bullying. CKCC is a 
social emotional learning program that has been a part of our school's instruction for many years. It has helped our 
school to develop a common culture of mutual respect and positive behavior for all members of our school 
community. In addition, we have begun to implement the RULER Approach to Social Emotional Learning that was 
created by the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. This approach helps to support a positive emotional climate and 
the development of these skills in both students and the adults in their lives. RULER began with staff personal and 
professional learning, and will continue with classroom instruction and family engagement, and become embedded 
seamlessly into policies and practices school-wide.  

The PTA’s Executive Board meetings are held once a month to organize sponsored events and fundraisers. The 
administration, Parent Coordinator, Guidance Counselor and two teacher liaisons attend each meeting to ensure that 
all parties are supporting one another and working towards common school goals and initiatives. 

Young Dancers in Repertory (YDR) Afterschool Program is a community based organization in which our school has 
partnered. YDR holds a daily afterschool program for students from Grades K-5 in which they provide dance, music, 
theatre, and visual arts classes. The program director works closely with the school community to ensure the same 
high expectations and a seamless day for our students. 

In conclusion, all members of our school community are committed to working collaboratively to improve student 
achievement and ensure that every child is prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive citizen.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

In September 2016, we opened our first Kindergarten Chinese Transitional Bilingual class. These students were 
instructed 50% in English and 50% in Chinese throughout the school day in Math, Social Studies, and Science. As the 
year progressed and the students became more proficient in English, this ratio was adjusted. Additionally, students 
were instructed solely in English for English Language Arts (ELA) and solely in Mandarin for the Home Language Arts 
period. This ensured that students mastered educational content in their primary language, and assisted students in 
becoming fluent in the second language.  

In September 2017, we continued to have a Kindergarten Chinese Transitional Bilingual class. Additionally, we 
expanded our program to include a Grade 1 Chinese Transitional Bilingual class. For the 2018-2019 school year, we 
will continue to expand the Chinese Transitional Bilingual Program to include a Grade 2 class. The goal of the 
transitional bilingual classes is to meet the needs of the students and to help assimilate them into English. As the year 
progresses, the amount of Chinese instruction will decrease as the amount of English instruction will increase. We 
have had many students that have reached the Commanding level as measured by the NYSELSAT exam and therefore 
have been placed into General Education Classes.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

“Collaborative Teachers“ is an element of the Framework for Great Schools in which PS 127 has made great progress 
over the past year. Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools through 
their work on vertical instructional planning teams, grade and subject specific teams, and strong co-teaching 
partnerships. Teachers have an opportunity to participate in professional development within the school and district, 
and share that knowledge with colleagues, fostering a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

Our Instructional team and grade/subject specific teams meet regularly to discuss the important concepts and 
understandings shared by each stakeholder. During conversations about practice, the members of the teams plan for 
professional learning opportunities to meet the varied needs of the staff, develop interest and feedback surveys, and 
create a solid annual professional development plan. Teachers share best practices and turn-key information gained 
from workshops. Teachers create and work towards professional goals that move their practice and pedagogical 
growth forward. 

Moving forward our key area of focus will be in “Rigorous Instruction” to ensure that our students are actively 
engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking. All staff members understand the 
importance of Common Core aligned curricula and expectations of the Framework for Teaching. Therefore across 
classrooms, consistently providing research-based strategies and multiple entry points into the curricula allow all 
learners, including ELLs and SWDs, to be engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-order 
thinking skills in student work products. It is necessary for teachers to plan for more Common Core-aligned and 
STEAM related project-based learning opportunities. The process and end product will increase student engagement 
in content and enhance the quality of student discussions. Additionally, Amplify Science is being implemented in 
order to blend digital experiences with hands-on lessons to inspire students to think like scientists and engineers and 
solve real world problems. Staff members attended a series of workshop during the July 2018 and began to turn-key 
their new learning to the staff. Additional Professional Development on the Amplify Science Program will be sought 
out and turn-keyed to the staff.  

A team of teachers attended a series of workshops on the implementation of the Passport to Social Studies program 
which was turn-keyed to staff members. Across classrooms, this comprehensive instructional resource was 
implemented to support strong Social Studies teaching and learning. Teachers incorporated the use of trade books 
and primary source documents to engage students in historical thinking and disciplinary literacy.  

During the 2017-2018 school year, our teachers of English Language Learners attended a series of workshops 
centered around Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills. The professional learning provided an in-depth understanding of 
ways towards meeting the goal of promoting advanced literacy among all students including those who are 
linguistically diverse. The text by Nonie K. Lesaux will continue to be a resource for teachers and staff to utilize as a 
guide to strengthen professional learning practices and instruction in the classroom in order to meet the students' 
considerable needs. Additionally, the teachers of English Language learns, along with the Assistant Principal in charge 
of English Language learners will be attending the second part of the Advanced Literacy Series being offered by the 
FSC.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. P.S. 127’s curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and Instructional Shifts. Teacher teams 
create curriculum maps which outline essential questions, student learning objectives, learning activities and 
resources, assessments, and tiered questions. All students engage in academic tasks and in standards-aligned units of 
study. When planning lessons, teachers prepare for engaging entry points, modeling, scaffolds, and extensions that 
support all learners. A variety of resources for student use is accessible to all students during each lesson. Across 
classrooms, teachers foster authentic discussions and encourage students to use academic vocabulary as well as 
accountable talk. 

Teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best. All 
staff members have attended professional development on the Danielson components and have a shared 
understanding of the research-based teaching framework. Teacher teams collaborate on designing or modifying 
curriculum-aligned assessments and rubrics that provide data to address the needs of students. Throughout the year, 
collaborative inquiry is sustained in order to continuously improve instruction.  

Teachers effectively analyze the data to glean information about students’ progress and learning needs. Teams of 
teachers have been engaged in inquiry-based professional collaborations that analyze classroom practice, assessment 
data, and student work. 

Instructional goals and action plans are established to explicitly address the student performance trends. An 
instructional focus is identified and clearly articulated among the members of the school community. Teacher teams 
are actively involved in the work of inquiry which focuses on deepening the understanding of academic vocabulary in 
writing as well as in student-to-student dialogue. 

With the cycle of inquiry being implemented throughout the school year, student performance trends are closely 
monitored. Student growth will be evident using a comparison of the results from the beginning and end of year 
Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) assessments. In addition, there will be an increase in students’ overall 
performance on state and local assessments. 

Teacher teams working closely to refine the current ELA curriculum maps to include culminating project-based tasks, 
increased opportunities for group work, and incorporate enhanced levels of questioning. We have developed a 
partnership with staff developers from Houghton-Mifflin Harcourt to provide ongoing professional development to 
support the staff with an understanding of the additional components of the literacy program. 

In addition, our school community will continue with the NYCDOE’s endorsed program, Go Math! Teachers have 
worked collaboratively and have created a pacing guide that will provide staff members across grades with a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

framework for implementation. It has been a common practice for teachers to use best practices from previous 
programs and also adjust current lessons to meet the various learning needs in their classrooms. Students have 
excelled using the comprehensive lesson design and components of Go Math! Teachers will continue this work by 
planning culminating project-based student tasks to be included in these existing guides. 

Our instructional core programs in ELA and Mathematics both include resources for engaging learners through the 
use of interactive on-line features. Teachers use SmartBoards and the available resources to enhance their teaching 
and learning taking place in the classrooms. Parents have attended workshops and given the opportunity to 
familiarize themselves with both programs’ features including the on-line resources such as Houghton Mifflin 
Harcourt (HMH) Think Central. Think Central offers teachers, parents, and students’ educational technology as a tool 
to support and enrich instruction. 

In looking at the data from the NYS ELA and Mathematics exams, we have had an increase on most grade levels in the 
levels of 3's and 4's from 2017 to 2018 as noted in the chart below.

Additionally, almost all of our English Language Learners made progress at at least 1-2 levels as measured by the 2018 
NYSESLAT exam. We have also had an increase of the number of students that reached the Commanding level on the 
2018 NYSESLAT exam. 

The 2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot revealed that 96% of parents feel that this school offers a wide enough 
variety of programs, classes, and activities to keep students interested in school. 

Our school's results in the six areas of school conditions and practices in the Framework for Great Schools indicate 
scores well above district and cit averages.  

The 2018 Framework Element Scores are as follows: 

Rigorous Instruction - 4.18  

Collaborative Teachers - 4.87 

Supportive Environment - 4.81 

Strong Family Community Ties - 4.35 

Trust - 4.90

All staff members understand the importance of Common Core aligned curricula and expectations of the Framework 
for Teaching. Therefore across classrooms, consistently providing research-based strategies and multiple entry points 
into the curricula allow all learners, including ELLs and SWDs, to be engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and 
demonstrate higher-order thinking skills in student work products.  

2. Moving forward, it is necessary for teachers to continue to plan for Common Core-aligned and STEAM related 
project-based learning opportunities. This will include the new Amplify Science curriculum which is rooted in the do-
talk-read-write-visualize model of learning. The students will be presented with problems in order for them to apply 
their newly acquired knowledge to real world scenarios. The students will have opportunities to investigate like 
scientists and engineers and demonstrate a deeper understanding of content. The process and end product will 
increase student engagement in content and enhance the quality of student discussions. Additionally, all staff 
members will continue to be trained in the RULER Approach in order to support the social and emotional growth of all 
of our students.

By June 2019, there will be at least a 10% overall increase in student performance across grade levels on the project-
based STEAM tasks as measured by the electronic data folder from the beginning-of-the year to the end-of-the year, as 
a result of the implementation of the new Amplify Science Program.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Research-based instructional programs (Journeys, Go Math!, 
Passport to Social Studies, AMPLIFY Science, Fundations, Sadlier 
Vocabulary Workshop) will continue to be implemented in all 
classrooms. Teachers will continue to work collaboratively to 
plan lessons and units of study to address the needs of all 
learners. Teachers will meet weekly on their common preps to 
plan these lessons and units of study. Teachers will also use this 
common planning time to analyze data and review student work 
products. Planning and preparation of all teachers will include 
differentiated instruction, high levels of student engagement, 
tiered questioning, as well as, the use of multiple entry points, 
scaffolds, and extensions.  

Strategies to address the needs of students with disabilities, 
English Language Learners, and other high-need student 
subgroups are embedded in curriculum maps and outlined in 
each teacher’s daily lesson plans. 

Using the Journeys reading program, the Go Math program, 
Passport to Social Studies, and the Amplify Science program, 
teachers will create comprehensive units around the elements of 
STEAM to provide hands-on, problem based approach to 
learning.

Professional Development will be planned based upon the needs 
of each staff member. A Professional Development Need Survey 
is distributed two times a year (Sept. and Jan.) to assess the 
interests and needs of staff. Additionally, professional 
development sessions are planned based upon observation 
cycles. 

 

We will continue to work closely with trained personnel from 
STEMteachersNYC who will provide all staff members with 
hands-on interactive professional learning on planning and 
implementing lessons around Science, Technology, Engineering, 
Arts, and Math.  

 

In addition, our Science teachers attended a series of 
professional development sessions during the summer months 
and began to turn-key the information received in order to 
successfully implement the Amplify Science program. 

 

Additional professional development will be sought out in order 
to continue with this cycle of learning and sharing among 
colleagues. 

 

Our teachers of English Language Learners along with 
administration will continue to provide Professional 
Development to the staff centered around Teaching Advanced 
Literacy Skills. The professional learning will provide an in-depth 
understanding of ways towards meeting the goal of promoting 
advanced literacy among all students including those who are 
linguistically diverse. The text by Nonie K. Lesaux will continue to 
be a resource for teachers and staff to utilize as a guide to 
strengthen professional learning practices and instruction in the 
classroom in order to meet the students' considerable needs. 
Additionally, the teachers of English Language learns, along with 
the Assistant Principal in charge of English Language learners will 
be attending the second part of the Advanced Literacy Series 
being offered by the FSC.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
“Time on Tuesdays” throughout the school year allows all staff members (Classroom teachers and Support Staff) to 
meet with parents, call parents, work on monthly newsletters, update the school website, complete student progress 
reports, and conduct workshops. With an open door policy and transparency, parents feel welcomed and are 
enthusiastic to volunteer their time and attend workshops presented by the teachers and Parent Coordinator, all of 
which establish a culture of trust and build parent capacity as we share an understanding of the Common Core 
Learning Standards (CCLS), Curriculum Expectations, Instructional Shifts, and the many ways we can prepare our 
children for future success. Parent workshops include training on how to use on-line resources such as the on-line 
component of our school’s ELA and Math curriculum, ThinkCentral and our school website, E-Chalk. Parents 
workshops will also include the introduction and overview of the new Amplify Science program.  

As we embrace a supportive environment and a strong home-school connection, we foster a school culture of high 
expectations. “Family Friday” is another opportunity for parents to actively participate in their child’s learning. Family 
Friday takes place the first Friday of every month and parents and family members are invited to go into the 
classroom to participate in an interactive hand-on activity with their child. 

There is open access to a parent room which is housed within our school building. Parents are able to sign in and use 
the computer, Internet, and a variety of resources available for their review. A monthly newsletter, “McKinley 
Monthly”, is distributed to inform our school community of our instructional goals and the many wonderful activities 
that are taking place in each class/program. Student Progress Reports are distributed to parents/guardians as a way to 
provide ongoing communication regarding their child’s performance and progress. 

The administration and Parent Coordinator are visible during all activities and events planned. We review the parent 
workshop surveys, attendance sheets, parent communication logs and reflection sheets in order to monitor parent 
and family engagement.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
As part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement planning, we have identified a mid-point benchmark that will 
indicate progress toward meeting the specified goal. Therefore, at the end of February 2019, the performance on the 
Winter STEAM-related task will be compared to the Fall STEAM-related task to monitor growth. There will be at least 
a 5% increase in overall student performance on the project-based STEAM tasks as measured by the data folder from 
the beginning-of-the year to the middle-of-the year. 

 

 

 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Throughout the year, all members of the school community will engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall 
cycle of continuous improvement planning. 

The instrument of measure that will be used to assess progress is task rubrics.  

The quality of our instructional core and success will be monitored using electronic data folders and through 
thoughtful examination of:  

*STEAM Unit Plans  

*Tasks Rubrics  

*Student work products 

*Student-to-student dialogue

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our educational community at P.S. 127 is committed to ensuring that all students strive for and achieve academic 
excellence. We believe that they can all succeed if the students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers 
and their peers. We foster a strong home-school connection with open lines of communication and an open door 
policy. We plan instructional programs to challenge students’ thinking and creativity. 

We have a large population of English Language Learners (ELLs) that continues to grow. Currently, we have 
approximately 23.41% of English Language Learners. Within this population of ELLs, the students entering at the 
Kindergarten level demonstrated a need of a Transitional Bilingual program. To support the students' needs and 
strengthen their native language development as well as content knowledge, P.S. 127 welcomes them to a Chinese 
Transitional Bilingual class in Kindergarten, in Grade 1 as well as in Grade 2. As a result, the students will be immersed 
in their native language while they build their social and academic English skills. 

Additionally, we have approximately 20.63% of Students with Disabilities (SWDs) and it is our job to ensure that all the 
students’ needs are met by providing them with multiple entry points and rigorous instruction. 

Teachers and support staff are committed to planning lessons to academically challenge all students at their level for 
the academic and social-emotional growth of the individual child. PS 127’s Professional Learning Teams meet 
regularly to analyze student work, look for trends and patterns and adjust curriculum to meet the needs of their 
students. 

The School Leadership Team assists in making school-wide goals. Through the use of vertical teams, we have a solid 
professional development plan to build the capacity of teachers and of learners by encouraging and welcoming staff 
members to become facilitators of areas of best practice. 

At P.S. 127 we are proud of our school culture, which welcomes families to be active participants in school-wide 
celebrations. Each classroom puts on at least one formal assembly program in which the parents are invited to watch 
their children. In addition, parents are invited in to be part of classroom celebrations such as, publishing parties and 
other project-based learning share fairs. Every month we also invite families to come into the classroom to participate 
in a learning activity with the child/children during family Friday. PTA meetings are held monthly, in which parents are 
informed of events going on within the school. A Dance Festival is held in year in June. The parents are invited to see 
their children dance with the entire grade during this culminating event. Parent workshops are held in order to help 
parents understand the instructional programs. Translations are provided for parents who do not speak English. 
Monthly progress reports are sent home to keep the lines of communication open and Tuesday afternoons are 
utilized by the teachers for parent communication and workshops. A parent room is also available to the parents, 
where there are computers set up and resources available for the parents to utilize. 

Our school will continue to use Competent Kids Caring Classroom (CKCC), a social emotional learning program and 
Book of the Month to help our school develop a common culture that supports our school mission and a focus on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24 

 

mutual respect and positive behavior from all members of the school community. In addition, we have begun to 
implement the RULER Approach to Social Emotional Learning that was created by the Yale Center for Emotional 
Intelligence. This approach helps to support a positive emotional climate and the development of these skills in both 
students and the adults in their lives. The rollout of RULER began with staff personnel and professional learning will be 
ongoing for staff and parents. The RULER approach will be utilized daily during instruction and discussed during family 
engagement time, As a new initiative, it will become embedded seamlessly into policies and practices school-wide.  
The school community will utilize the RULER tools such as: " A Class Charter", "Take a Meta-Moment", the Mood 
Meter, and the Blueprint for Problem Solving to positively impact students academically, socially and emotionally.  

Inspirational Quotes are shared throughout the school year to allow students and the school community to reflect on 
positive messages and create supportive classroom environment as well as enhance school climate. "Feeling Words 
Curriculum" from RULER will be integrated across subject areas to allow them to label, understand, express and 
regulate emotions. Each week, we have planned Wednesday's Words of Wisdom which will introduce feeling words to 
the school community.  

 

School’s Needs Relative to the Capacity Framework: 

 

In looking at the data from the NYS ELA and Mathematics exams, we have had an increase on most grade levels in the 
levels of 3's and 4's from 2017 to 2018. Additionally, almost all of our English Language Learners made progress of at 
least 1-2 proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT exam in the Spring of 2018.  

Based upon the 2017 School Quality Snapshot , 87% of teachers indicate that adults at their school have access to 
school based support to assist in behavioral and emotional escalations. At P.S. 127 we strive for excellence in all areas, 
Therefore, our goal is to maintain a positive school culture and plan to implement additional strategies through the 
RULER approach in order to do so. Maintaining a positive and supportive culture will allow the students to succeed 
socially, emotionally, and academically. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, P.S. 127 will continue to build coherent instructional and social-emotional supports to improve student 
achievement for all students, including English Language Learners and students with disabilities. By providing students 
with a supportive environment both academically and social / emotionally, students will show an increase of at least 
3% on NYS ELA and Math exams.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
 

As part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement planning, we have identified mid-point benchmarks that will 
indicate progress toward meeting the specified goal. By the end of January 2019, there will be at least a 1% increase 
of student performance in ELA and Math that will be measured by the data obtained from the benchmark 
assessments in both, ELA and Math. In addition, the social emotional well-being of students will be monitored by the 
utilization of the Mood Meter as well as the other RULER strategies implemented. By the end of January 2019, OORS 
reports will be reviewed to assess its effectiveness..  

 

 

 

 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
Throughout the year, all members of the school community will engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall 
cycle of continuous improvement planning. 

The assessment tool that will measure progress towards meeting the annual goal will be the OORS data reports which 
will be reviewed at the safety meetings scheduled in January and June of 2019.  

In January 2019, the following items will also be reviewed and discussed as a mid-point benchmark to monitor 
progress toward meeting our goal:  

*Reflection Sheets from Parent Workshops  

*Workshop Attendance Sheets 

*MOTP Progress Reports 

*Use of the Mood Meter

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Teachers across grades and programs are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms. They 
work collaboratively to plan lessons, reflect on instruction, differentiate learning tasks, and make adjustments when 
needed. All constituents of P.S. 127 share the same vision and set of beliefs about how students learn best and 
understand the importance of the implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards, the Instructional Shifts, 
and the Danielson Framework. 

Teacher teams collaborate on designing or modifying curriculum-aligned assessments and rubrics that provide data to 
address the needs of students. Throughout the year, collaborative inquiry is sustained in order to continuously 
improve instruction. With the cycle of inquiry being implemented throughout the school year, student performance 
trends are closely monitored. Student growth will be evident using a comparison of the results from the beginning 
and end of year Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) assessments. In addition, there will be an increase in students’ 
overall performance on state and school wide assessments. 

Inquiry teams are working closely to refine the current curriculum maps to include STEAM project-based tasks, 
increased opportunities for group work, and enhanced levels of questioning and discussions. We will continue to 
collaborate with professional developers from STEMteachersNYC. Additionally, teachers will be attending training 
sessions for the Amplify Science program. Turn-key sessions will be planned and rolled out throughout the school year 
in order for all staff members to become familiar with the expectations and implementation of the new program. 
Furthermore, training sessions will be planned to successfully roll out the tools and strategies needed to implement 
the RULER approach to social emotional learning. 

Teachers effectively analyze the data to glean information about students’ progress and learning needs. Teams of 
teachers have been engaged in inquiry-based professional collaborations that analyze classroom practice, assessment 
data, and student work. 

Multiple sources of data (formative and summative assessments) are compiled and analyzed to enhance teaching and 
learning. The formative assessments in ELA include: Fountas and Pinnell Assessments, Teacher created Periodic 
Assessments, the Journeys Benchmark Assessments (Units 1, 3, and 5). In addition, the summative assessments in ELA 
include the NYS ELA exam. The formative assessments in Math include the GO Math! Beginning, Middle and End of 
Year assessments. STEAM related project–based student tasks are planned for and monitored, as well as conference 
notes, exits slips, student work samples, and student self-reflections. All classroom assessments are tracked and 
monitored for progress by teachers and administration three times a year: November, February, and May. 

In looking at the data from the NYS ELA and Mathematics exams, we have had an increase on most grade levels in the 
levels of 3's and 4's from 2017 to 2018.  Additionally, almost all of our English language Learners made progress of at 
least 1-2 proficiency levels on the NYSESLAT exam in the Spring of 2018.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          30 

 

Based on the data analysis, the members of the school community understand the importance of and need for 
professional development. School leaders set clear expectations and provide actionable feedback aligned to 
professional goals which support teacher growth and development. Teachers work collaboratively with school leaders 
and faculty to ensure that rigorous habits and higher-order thinking skills are embedded across grades.  

School’s Needs Relative to the Capacity Framework: 

2. Moving forward, continuous cycles of professional development will continue to include learning rounds in which 
teachers have opportunities to share their own best practices, learn from colleagues, and provide feedback to one 
another. Furthermore, additional common planning time will be added to the school program for each grade level, 
teacher teams, and support staff.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 3% growth in student performance for all students, including ELLs and SWDs , as measured 
by NYS ELA and Math exams, as well as the Fountas and Pinnell assessments.

Through collaborative inquiry and data analysis, teachers 
generate opportunities for new understandings and actions. 
Teacher teams use data to narrow their focus, select students, 
and identify a learning target. Teachers understand that the 
primary purpose of inquiry is to meet the needs of all students 
by engaging them in rich and relevant learning. 

 

Therefore, assessment for learning is essential and the ability to 
analyze the evidence with colleagues is the key to the inquiry 
process. Teachers meet regularly to engage in professional 
dialogue that focuses on student-centered issues and teacher 
reflection which leads to further predictions regarding how 
students learn best. They meet regularly to closely analyze what 
the students were taught in relation to the identified skill and 
how existing practices have left gaps in students’ understanding. 
Based upon their findings, team members continue to make 
strategic changes and monitor improvement.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
“Time on Tuesdays ” throughout the school year allows all staff members (Classroom teachers and Support staff) to 
meet with parents, call parents, work on monthly newsletters, update the school website, complete student progress 
reports, and conduct workshops. With an open door policy and transparency, parents feel welcomed and are 
enthusiastic to volunteer their time and attend workshops, all of which establish a culture of trust and build parent 
capacity as we share an understanding of the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS), Curriculum Expectations, 
Instructional Shifts, and the many ways we can prepare our children for future success. Parent workshops include 
training on how to use on-line resources such as the on-line component of our school’s ELA and Math curriculum, 
ThinkCentral and our school website, E-Chalk. 

As we embrace a supportive environment and a strong home-school connection, we foster a school culture of high 
expectations. “Family Friday” is another opportunity for parents to actively participate in their child’s learning. Family 
Friday takes place the first Friday of every month. 

There is open access to a parent room which is housed within our school building. Parents are able to sign in and use 
the computer, internet, and a variety of resources available for their review. A monthly newsletter, “McKinley 
Monthly”, is distributed to inform our school community of our instructional goals and the many wonderful activities 
that are taking place in each class/program. Student Progress Reports are distributed to parents/guardians as a way to 
provide ongoing communication regarding their child’s performance and progress.

The instrument of measure that is used to assess progress is each teacher's data folder which records the students' 
results of the ELA and Math assessments three times a year (October, February, June). 

The quality of the success and improvement of pedagogical practices and its impact on student achievement will 
continue to be monitored through thoughtful examination of additional items such as: 

*Classroom observations 

*MOTP Progress Reports 

*Student work products 

*Attendance sheets from professional learning and teacher team meetings 

*Professional Development Experience sheets 

*Reflection sheets 

*Professional goals 

*MOSL assessment results  

*State exam scores 

*Mood Meter 

By June 2019, the students’ results of exams, the individual performance recorded in data folders, and student work 
products will demonstrate high quality teacher pedagogy and an increased proficiency level in ELA and Math by 3%. In 
addition, this work will enhance the established culture for learning which communicates high expectations to staff, 
students, and families.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. According to the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide, the Framework and Survey Element Scores for Effective School 
Leadership were 4.58.  

At P.S. 127 the leadership has established many systems and structures which allow for an environment of 
professional growth of teachers and staff as well as the development of instructional and social-emotional supports to 
drive student achievement. 

School leaders and staff effectively communicate expectations connected to a path to college and career readiness 
and successfully partner with families to support student progress toward those expectations. 

Teacher teams and staff establish a culture for learning that systematically communicates a unified set of high 
expectations for all students and provide clear, focused, and effective feedback and guidance/advisement supports to 
ensure that students, including high-need subgroups, own their educational experience and are prepared for the next 
level. 

As a school community, we have established a culture connected to college and career readiness with high 
expectations and mutual accountability. Our school vision, mission, and motto are displayed throughout the school 
and clearly explain our school’s expectations. Each morning, pledge leaders proudly share the words of our school 
motto, “Believe! Achieve! Succeed! Excellence is our goal” which reinforces the values of our school community and 
what we strive for. 

Each school year begins with an assembly where students on each grade meet to discuss their expectations, 
responsibilities, and goals. This year, “Back to School Night” offered the wonderful opportunity for staff members and 
families to meet and begin the school year with a partnership that supports high expectations and students’ progress 
towards college and career readiness. 

A Parent Handbook is distributed to all families. It has been created for families to familiarize themselves with school 
policies and procedures. It also provides families with dates of meetings and special school events. A “Meet and 
Greet” is planned for all the new families that have become a part of our school community. 

At P.S. 127, there is an open door policy and there are many opportunities that foster our strong emphasis on 
“Parents as Partners”. Parents are not only involved in the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) yet parent volunteers are 
visible daily as they engage in numerous activities that are essential in supporting our efforts towards the 
enhancement of student learning. Our Parent Coordinator is instrumental in promoting effective partnering with 
families and establishing a strong home-school connection. This focus has been embodied in our work and aimed at 
supporting students’ progress toward college and career readiness.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

Parent Volunteers meet regularly with the Parent Coordinator and members of the Executive Board to plan events 
such as the Halloween Parade, Career Day, Desserts Around the World, Movie Night, Thanksgiving Food Drive, Toys 
for Tots, Multicultural Luncheon, Donuts with Dads, Muffins with Moms, Game Night, Carnival, Spring Gala, bake 
sales, picture day, holiday boutiques, and classroom celebrations. 

Each class has a designated Class Parent who serves as the liaison to the other parents within that class. This allows 
parents to be involved and engaged in their child’s learning. Class parents meet with the Parent Coordinator once a 
month following Family Friday to discuss the upcoming events and activities. 

There is open access to a parent room which is housed within our school. Parents are able to sign in and use the 
computer, internet, and a variety of resources available for their review. 

As we continue to foster an environment where our school partners with families to reach the expectations of Next 
Generation Standards, and those set by the school community, parents are invited into the classrooms on a monthly 
basis to actively participate in their child’s learning during “Family Friday”. 

The School Leadership Team (SLT) comprised of elected parents and staff members as well as the Principal, PTA 
Presidents, and UFT Chapter Leader meet monthly to develop school-based educational policies and ensure that 
resources are aligned to implement those policies. The members of the SLT play a significant role in creating a 
structure for school-based decision making, and shaping the path to a collaborative school culture. 

A Staff Handbook is provided to all staff members. The content is carefully reviewed in order to communicate 
essential information that is important and relevant to our belief that education is a shared responsibility that works 
best when there is mutual respect between staff, parents, students, and the community. It is based on the 
significance of high expectations and quality instruction which is meaningful and challenging allowing our students to 
achieve their highest potential. 

At the beginning of each school year, the staff meets together to review data trends over the course of several years. 
Once the Item Skills Analysis is release from the state, staff members again meet to review noticings and trends by 
reviewing the released test questions, and together develop an instructional focus for the school. Using this method 
of data analysis, as well as including the RULER Approach to social and emotional intelligence the current area of 
focus was determined as an area of need for the 2018-2019 school year: By increasing academic vocabulary as well as 
enhancing social and emotional learning, students will develop their emotional skills and improve their overall 
academic performance in a positive school culture. The use of data plays in instrumental part in planning instruction 
for the students and professional development for the teachers. Collaboration is essential in targeting areas of growth 
for the school as a whole.  

School’s Needs Relative to the Capacity Framework: 

The administration leads by example and nurtures the professional growth of teachers and staff in order to develop 
and deliver instructional, emotional, and social support to drive student success. 

2. Informed by the Capacity Framework Element- Effective School Leadership, there is a need to continue to offer 
professional development opportunities and in-service workshops as well as provide meaningful feedback to the staff. 
Therefore, professional development will be an ongoing focus to improve instructional practice.

By June 2019, administration will use data from multiple sources such as the MOTP Progress Reports, electronic data 
folders for ELA, Math, and STEAM- project-based tasks, as well as Professional Development Experience sheets to plan 
professional development tailored to teachers' needs. As a result, 5% of teachers will have an increase in their 
Danielson rating in Domain 4: Professional Responsibilities

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Throughout the 2018-2019 school year, administrators will 
facilitate the process of teachers becoming independent 
professional learners by developing professional learning plans 
as evidenced by cycles of inquiry, agendas, student work 
samples, STEAM-related performance tasks and formal/informal 
observations based on Danielson’s Framework. 

Teachers continue to plan for lessons aligned to the Common 
Core Standards in all content areas, implement the Next 
Generation Standards, differentiate instruction, score and 
analyze assessments and student work, implement the STEAM 
project-based tasks and plan next steps. This takes place during 
common preps and during the "Other Professional Work Time", 
as well as designated planning days throughout the school year. 

 

In addition, professional development in the Amplify Science 
Program and Passport to Social Studies will continue to be 
offered to the classroom teachers and support staff, with a focus 
on differentiated instruction, Common Core Learning Standards, 
and the implementation of STEAM project-based tasks. 

 

Teachers determine the instructional needs of their students 
through the analysis of the STEAM-related performance tasks, 
the end of unit assessments, and informal observations. During 
grade meetings and professional development sessions teachers 
also use their data to formulate strategy groups.. 

During each initial planning conference, teachers will meet with 
administrators to plan their professional goals for the 2018-2019 
school year. At the summative conference, teachers will reflect 
on the status of their goal while discussing evidence and

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
“Time on Tuesdays ” throughout the school year allows all staff members (Classroom teachers and Support Staff) to 
meet with parents, call parents, work on monthly newsletters, update the school website, complete student progress 
reports, and conduct workshops. With an open door policy and transparency, parents feel welcomed and are 
enthusiastic to volunteer their time and attend workshops, all of which establish a culture of trust and build parent 
capacity as we share an understanding of the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS), Curriculum Expectations, 
Instructional Shifts, and the many ways we can prepare our children for future success. Parent workshops include 
training on how to use on-line resources such as the on-line component of our school’s ELA and Math curriculum, 
ThinkCentral and our school website, E-Chalk. 

As we embrace a supportive environment and a strong home-school connection, we foster a school culture of high 
expectations. “Family Friday” is another opportunity for parents to actively participate in their child’s learning. Family 
Friday takes place the first Friday of every month. 

There is open access to a parent room which is housed within our school building. Parents are able to sign in and use 
the computer, internet, and a variety of resources available for their review. A monthly newsletter, “McKinley 
Monthly”, is distributed to inform our school community of our instructional goals and the many wonderful activities 
that are taking place in each class/program. Student Progress Reports are distributed to parents/guardians as a way to 
provide ongoing communication regarding their child’s performance and progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. According to the 2017-2018 Quality School Snapshot 98% of parents are satisfied with the education that their 
child has received this year and 96% of parents feel that the school offers a wide enough variety of courses, 
extracurricular activities, and services. 

P.S. 127 is committed to enhancing parental engagement activities and building parents’ understanding of the 
Common Core learning Standards in order to help their children to be college and career ready. 

Parents are not only involved in the Parent Teacher Association, they also volunteer on a regular basis to sell cupcakes 
on Cupcake Friday, during monthly activities such as Donuts for Dads, Muffins for Moms, serve as Learning Leaders, 
members of the School Leadership Team, Executive Board, picture days, holiday sales throughout the year, book fairs, 
Family Fridays, the Halloween Parade, the School Carnival, the International Luncheon, candy sale fundraisers, school 
dances, “Sports Night”, Teacher Appreciation Luncheon, A Day of Gratitude, and Relay for Life. 

Additionally, to emphasize the focus of “Parents as Partners” teachers commit to planning classroom celebrations 
during the year which include the families. All of these practices help to foster an environment where the school 
partners with families to reach the expectations of the Common Core and those set by the school community. 

Tuesday parental involvement time is utilized as a way for teachers to conduct parent outreach face to face or by 
phone regarding student progress and performance. This is in addition to the 4 contractual parent teacher meetings 
held throughout the school year. Monthly progress reports are used to keep parents informed of their child’s 
academic progress. Teachers also organize professional development for parents during the Tuesday Afternoon 
Parent Engagement Time. 

 

School’s Needs Relative to the Capacity Framework: 

2. To develop parental understanding of key curriculum programs and promote parental involvement, we will 
continue to plan academic and enrichment workshops. Additionally, staff members will continue to communicate 
student progress and performance consistently throughout the school year. Class Parents will serve as a liaison to also 
strengthen the home-school connection. Furthermore, the utilization of a tool such as School Messenger will send out 
reminders of parent workshops in order to increase attendance.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
As we inquire about Highly Qualified Teachers, we collect and read through resumes, call references, and take 
recommendations prior to employment. We interview prospective hires in order to ensure a highly qualified 
employee. We monitor substitute teachers through informal observations during their daily work. The use of a 
research based framework for enhancing professional practice is used in short frequent cycles of classroom 
observation in order to develop a common lens for instruction and set clear expectations. We include our pedagogues 
in our teacher team discussions, our grade meetings, and all of the professional development opportunities that are 
offered within our school. We differentiate professional development opportunities through needs assessments 
gathered from surveys, collegial conversations, and informal observations in order to enhance teaching practices, 
increase rigor, and improve student outcomes. The analysis of multiple data resources such as informal and formal 
observations, scores on the state exams, student work products, etc. as well as teacher qualifications and expertise 
assist the administration when making organizational decisions. All new teachers are mentored by a school-based 
mentor. The school-based mentor provides a minimum of two periods a week of mentoring to each new teacher, 
which includes co-planning, conferences, classroom support, and professional development. Mentoring is tracked 
using the Mentor Tracking System online. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Staff members actively pursue opportunities to grow and develop professionally. All staff members complete an 
Interest Survey which indicates the types of professional development they would like to attend. All staff members 
set goals and create actions plans. The members of the staff meet with the administration three times a year to 
discuss the goals that have been set. From informal and formal observations, areas in need of improvement are 
noted. Staff members who have common components that need to be strengthened are grouped together and 
provided targeted professional development. Each Monday afternoon, all staff members participate in professional 
learning within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. Job-embedded professional development, such as 
joint planning, study groups, lesson studies, and inquiry work are providing opportunities for teachers to learn from 
each other. Teacher team meetings and instructional team meetings also involve analyzing various sources of data, 
identifying trends, and refining curriculum. Teachers apply newly acquired knowledge and skills in order to increase 
the impact on student learning. Reflection sheets are completed for the School-Based Staff Development Committee 
to review. Inter-visitations are set up for teachers to learn from one another and refine their instructional practices. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Staff members work with staff developers from varied outside organizations, such as STEMteachersNYC etc. Ongoing 
professional development is offered for teachers, paraprofessionals, support staff, and administration by District 20 
Community Superintendent Karina Costantino, District 20 Community Education Council, and various offices within 
the Department of Education. Staff members who attend workshops complete a Professional Development 
Experience Sheet. Administration collects it and plans the time for turn-key sessions. Professional development 
opportunities for staff members are extensive and numerous which ensures that every teacher is continuously highly 
qualified.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
Parents/Guardians of children who are new to our school meet with the Parent Coordinator to discuss essential data 
about the school and tour the school building. They register during the registration period and receive an acceptance 
letter along with our School Brochure. They are informed about our school website which provides them with 
additional resources along with necessary information such as school hours, arrival/dismissal procedures, supply lists, 
etc.  

A “Meet and Greet” Breakfast along with an Orientation with the Teachers, Administration, Parent Coordinator, and 
the PTA Executive Board is scheduled for the first day of school. The first day of school for our Kindergarten children is 
a half day which helps transition them from a half day to a full day of school. If further accommodations are needed 
for individual students, the support team assists by creating a Transition Plan which may allow a child to gradually 
assimilate to the demands of Kindergarten. 

Our new incoming Kindergarten students who will be new to New York City public schools and whose home language 
is other than English will be administered the New York State Identification Test for English Language Learners 
(NYSITELL) in order to determine English Language Learner (ELL) status. In order to plan for the ESL program , the 
children will be invited at the end of June to administer the NYSITELL for mandated services.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
In order to prepare to select the Measures of Student Learning (MOSL) for the teacher evaluation system, MOSL team 
members are identified. Administration and the MOSL team meet before the school year begins to discuss current 
assessments utilized throughout the building. Data analysis will be used to inform our decisions for the MOSL 
selections throughout the school community. The findings and final decisions will be discussed and communicated 
with the staff.  

 

As a result of ongoing conversations around improving alignment between instruction and assessments, teachers 
created their own Periodic Assessments to administer at the beginning and end of the school year. 

 

Our ELA and Math programs have a variety of embedded assessments which the teachers administer to gather data 
on student performance as well as monitor their progress. Data folders will be utilized to track students three times a 
year and used as a communicative tool with administration.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 127, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 127 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA;

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P.S. 127, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
The goal for the Saturday Academy for English Language Learners (ELLs) is for students to be 
provided with a safe learning environment and to be able to take risks in learning social and 
academic English. Students will learn basic language and communication skills that will allow 
them to actively participate in their classroom. Beyond offering instruction in  English, the 
program is designed to teach core academic courses and provide services to help newcomers 
adjust to living in the United States. 
The key is for educators to understand the needs of all subgroups, specifically our ELLs and to 
design instruction that meets their needs. In this program, there will be 3 certified ENL 
teachers and 3 certified Common Branch teachers working collaboratively to support our ELL 
population. They will utilize an integrated model for instruction. The teachers will provide direct 
instruction utilizing a team teaching approach. The program for the Winter / Spring of 2019 will 
consist of 97 students that range from the Entering to Expanding levels in grades 1 
through 5.  The Grade 1 through Grade 5 Saturday ELL Academy will have 13 sessions. The 
dates of the sessions for 2018 will be as follows:  Jan. 12th, Jan. 19th, Jan. 26th, Feb. 2nd, Feb. 
9th, March 2nd, March 9th, March 16th, March 23rd,  March 30th,  April 6th, April 13th and 
May 4th. The program will run each Saturday from 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 a.m. Students will learn 
basic language and communication skills that will give them the opportunity to actively 
participate in their classroom.  
Upon arrival, children will receive a light snack while being supervised. Attendance folders will 
be utilized to monitor student attendance each day of service. One administrator will be 
responsible for supervising the program. The program will be held on Saturdays because there 
are other programs that are offered during the week in which many of our English Language 
Learners attend. Offering the Saturday Academy for ELLs at the same time as the other 
programs would not allow many of the students the opportunity to attend both. Therefore, it is 
necessary to hold the program on a Saturday, when other programs are not running. This will 
allow the students the opportunity to attend the Saturday Academy without missing the 
opportunity to attend other programs that are held on other school days. A supervisor must be on 
site to supervise since there can not be students and teachers in the building without a supervisor 
present.  A secretary is needed to monitor the attendance records by distributing attendance 
folders to teachers before each session begins, and also for collecting the attendance folders after 
the teachers have taken attendance. The secretary will then review the attendance to ensure that 
students that are enrolled are attending each week. If there are students that are absent or 
consistently not attending, the secretary will make every effort to  contact the parents/guardians. 
Additionally, the secretary will assist with the other daily running of the office functions. 
The remainder of the Title III funds will be dedicated to Professional Development and 
additional school funding  (Title I funding) will be used to purchase bilingual dictionaries, dual 
language children's books, vocabulary context cards, thematic flip books and other material to 
support the program. In addition, NYSESLAT test prep materials, "Getting Ready for the 
NYSESLAT", which has been purchased with Title I money, will be utilized to help prepare 
students for the components on the NYSESLAT exam. All resources will be used to facilitate the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67

acquisition of the English language and address the skills of listening, speaking, reading, and 
writing.  
All letters that are and will continue to be sent home are translated into all home languages. 
Parent letters regarding the program will be collected by the classroom teachers, and sent down 
to the secretary, The secretary will be responsible archiving the letters and for creating 
attendance charts for this program. 
Translators are readily available to assist with parent communication and at parent meetings such 
as PTA meetings, Parent Teacher Conferences, and other school-wide events.  
Data is gathered from multiple sources such as the NYSITELL, as well as from 
NYSESLAT scores using the EDAT (English Language Learner Data Analysis Tool). In 
addition, classroom teachers as well as the ENL support teachers monitor students' progress three 
times a year. Each student's performance on classroom chapter and unit assessments, project-
based tasks, and benchmark assessments in ELA and Mathematics are tracked using an 
electronic data folder.

Begin description here:            
The goal of the administration is to provide all members of our school community with 
opportunities for professional development that support the academic gains and English language 
development of all of our students including English Language Learners and immigrant students 
. All staff members are encouraged to attend outside professional development sessions offered 
by the district and outside agencies. Staff members who attend professional development must 
complete a Professional Development Experience sheet which is used to plan for a turn-key 
session with colleagues. This allows us to grow and develop professionally, continue 
to  strengthen and refine current teaching practices, as well as build capacity amongst the staff. 
Our Brooklyn South Field Support Center, along with the DELLS offers professional 
development opportunities to all teachers who work with ELLs. All licensed classroom teachers, 
service providers and paraprofessionals attend staff conferences and other professional 
development opportunities offered in and outside of the school building to ensure that they will 
be able to provide support to assist all of our ELL and immigrant students as they transition from 
one proficiency level to another. In addition to teaching our ELL and immigrant populations, our 
certified ENL teachers will provide in-school staff development. They will provide ongoing 
support for common branch and special education classroom teachers, occupational/speech 
therapists and paraprofessionals regarding ENL methodologies and strategies. Our ENL teachers 
will share their insights and demonstrate the importance of providing ELLs and immigrant 
students with background knowledge and scaffolds to support their academic language 
proficiency needed to help ELLs and immigrant students grow and progress towards meeting 
Common Core State Standards.  
Another goal is to provide P.S 127 staff members with an understanding of the stages and 
process of language acquisition,  along with the various cultural and native language transfer

factors that can impact the process. Our secretary has attended professional development 
workshops provided by the NYC Department of Education which focuses on pertinent 
information regarding working with ELLs and immigrants as well as their parents and families 
during the initial registration process, accessing vital information pertaining to ELLs through 
ATS, and the appropriate support involved in completing the updated Home Language 
Identification Survey (HLIS). 
Our Guidance Counselor attended professional development pertaining to a “Respect for All” 
anti-bullying initiative. The training touches upon several issues affecting ELLs and immigrant 
students, including the need for multicultural awareness and sensitivity. One of the goals of this 
initiative is to help create an inclusive, welcoming school and classroom environment where 
children of all backgrounds can thrive. The Principal and one of the two Assistant Principals 
attended RULER training at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. The information will be 
turn-keyed to the entire staff during the school year. The school focus will also continue to be 
vocabulary in order to support the language development and social emotional development of 
all of our students. 
As mentioned above, our ENL, common-branch/special education teachers as well as service 
providers and paraprofessionals attend staff development in and outside of our school building to 
ensure student success for all of our students, including our ELLs and immigrant students. Staff 
members who participate in professional development workshops that touch upon the needs of 
our ELL and immigrant populations have and will continue to conduct turn-key staff 
development during staff conferences.  A minimum of  15% of the required professional 
development for all General Education teachers prescribed by CR Part 154 will be dedicated to 
language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners and immigrant 
students. For all ENL teachers a minimum of 50% of the required PD hours will be dedicated to 
language acquisition in alignment with core content are instruction, including a focus on best 
practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English 
Language Learners and immigrant students. A professional development schedule is maintained 
by administration and school staff is required to sign in at all conferences to verify attendance. 
During the 2017-2018 school year, the ELL Coordinator and ENL teachers attended Professional 
Development sessions offered from the Brooklyn South Field Support Center, the Department of 
Education, and outside agencies. 
On September 14, 2017, the ENL teacher team, along with an administrator attended the ELL 
Kick-off for the Brooklyn South Field Support Center. 
On October 16, 2017, the Brooklyn South Field Support Center ELL Services Coordinator/D20 
ELL Liaison provided the ENL team and administration with support in accessing and utilizing 
ATS and STARS reports for ELLS. 
On October 24, 2017 and October 26, 2017, the Brooklyn South Field Support Center ELL 
Service Coordinator/D20 Liaison provided the administration and ENL team with professional 
development on utilizing the new components of the EDAT and how to analyze this data to 
target instruction for growth. This information was shared with all staff members during our 
Monday Professional Learning Sessions on October 30, 2017 and November 6, 2017 for a "Deep 
Dive into the EDAT". 
Common preps have been designated to provide grade-specific professional development. At 
these meetings, teachers analyze student work using an inquiry approach and plan next steps. 
During this time, they use professional literature to further their knowledge on how to address 
the needs of English Language Learners and immigrant students. All teachers received a copy of 
the GO-TO Strategies: Scaffolding Options for Teachers of English Language Learners by Linda 
New Levine, Laura Lukens, and Betty Ansin Smallwood as a resource.  These strategies are used 
during cycles of inquiry. 
In addition, our ENL teachers facilitated staff development workshops which included: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

Part C: Professional Development  
• Diving Deep into the EDAT - Staff analyzed student information on the EDAT (ELL Data 
Analysis Tool) and its implications on ELL and State Assessments. 
• Enhancing Co-Teaching Practices – Staff reviewed the Seven Co-Teaching Models and 
observed best practices in an integrated ENL classroom. 
• Getting to Know the NYSESLAT – Staff reviewed samples of grade-specific short response 
and extended response questions from ENGAGE NY. 
Furthermore, this year our ELL Coordinator and ENL teachers have attended Professional 
Development sessions from the Borough Field Support Center and DELLS offered Professional 
Development opportunities to all teachers who work with ELLs. All licensed classroom teachers, 
service providers, and paraprofessionals attend staff conferences and other professional 
development opportunities offered in and outside of the school building to ensure that they will 
be able to provide the scaffolds and supports needed to assist all of our ELLs as they transition 
from one proficiency level to another. In addition to teaching our ELL population, our certified 
ENL teachers will provide in-school staff development and support for common branch and 
special education teachers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, and 
paraprofessionals regarding ENL methodologies and strategies with an emphasis on the 
importance of providing ELLs with background knowledge and scaffolds to support their 
academic language proficiency needed to help ELLs grow and progress towards meeting the 
standards.  
Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills, a Guide for Leaders in Linguistically Diverse Schools, is 
being used as a valuable resource to guide staff members towards meeting the goal of promoting 
advanced literacy among all students, including those who are linguistically diverse.  Our ENL 
Teacher Team attended extended training provided by our Borough Field Support Center 
throughout the 2017-2018 school year. The information was shared with staff members during 
the Chancellor's Conference Day on June 7, 2018 and will continue during to 2018-2019 school 
year. 
Other professional development will be sought out throughout the 2018-2019 school year in 
addition to the support provided monthly by the Brooklyn South Field Support Center and ELL 
Services Coordinator/D20 ELL Liaison. The ENL Teacher Team, along with the Assistant 
Principal who oversees the English Language Learners have attended the ELL Kick Off offered 
by the Field  Support Center on September 14, 2018. ENL Teachers have also registered for the 
upcoming sessions being offered on ATS and STARS Programming for ELLs on October 10, 
2018. The Principal and Assistant Principals will continue to gain further knowledge and 
resources from monthly inter-visitations and meetings which focus on Advanced Literacy Skills 
and best teaching practices for English Language Learners. The dates of the sessions are as 
follows throughout the 2018-2019 school year: 
September 13th,  October 4th, October 18th, November 1st, November 29th,  December 6th, 
December 20th, January 10th,  January 24th, February 7th, February 28th, April 4th, April 18th, 
May 9th, May 23rd,  June 13th. 
Lisa Lin from DELLS, will also be hosting professional learning sessions for our Chinese 
Bilingual teacher in order to create a professional learning community among bilingual teachers. 
The community will consist of 6 Chinese Bilingual Teachers from District 20. Our Chinese 
Bilingual Teacher is one of the teachers who will be teaching the Saturday Academy for English 
Language Learners at PS 127. The dates of the Professional Learning Sessions will take place 
during the 2018-2019 school year and are as follows: 
October 3rd, December 4th, February 7th, April 9th, and June 7th. All Professional Learning 
Sessions will be turn-keyed to the staff during the Monday afternoon's Professional Learning 
time. 
Additionally,  PS 127 has reached out to Education Consortium LLC., an Educational Consulting 
Firm comprised of dedicated professionals whose goals are to ensure that English Language 
Learners and immigrant students are successful in the NYCDOE public schools.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 

Part C: Professional Development  
Professional development will positively impact the progress of English Language Learners and 
immigrant students while strengthening teacher pedagogy. Teachers will continue to gain 
knowledge and increase their repertoire of strategies to meet the needs of all students, including 
the ELL and immigrant population.  Teachers understand how essential it is to implement 
multiple entry points as well as scaffolds and supports in order to address the various learning 
styles and needs of subgroups of students. Providing strong student supports will lead to student 
achievement and an overall increase in graduation rates while also preparing students to be 
College and Career ready. 
Another goal is to provide P.S. 127 staff members with an understanding of the stages and 
process of language acquisition,  along with the various cultural and native language transfer 
factors that can impact the process. ENL teachers will participate in  webinars such as, ELLs and 
Common Core Academic Standards: Successful Strategies for the Content Classroom, presented 
by Ron Rohac. This presentation offers practical tools for educators to address the Common 
Core standards emphasis on literacy skills. It teaches reading strategies and vocabulary-building 
activities in core subjects like science, mathematics, and language arts. These strategies will 
prepare English Language Learners to meet the Common Core standards, college and career 
readiness standards, and rigorous academic work. They are based on techniques Mr. Rohac has 
developed and tested with considerable success. The approach is based on the Sheltered 
Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) model and has been proven to enhance ELL student 
ability and raise assessment scores. The webinar demonstrates  sequencing lesson plans using 
Universal Design for Learning to maximize comprehension and encourage active participation 
for all proficiency levels. 
Common preps have been designated to provide grade-specific professional development. At 
these meetings, teachers analyze student work using an inquiry approach and plan next steps. 
During this time, they use professional literature to further their knowledge on how to address 
the needs of English Language Learners. All teachers received a copy of the GO-TO Strategies: 
Scaffolding Options for Teachers of English Language Learners by Linda New Levine, Laura 
Lukens, and Betty Ansin Smallwood as an additional resource. 
All staff members who attend professional development complete a PD Experience Sheet which 
is used to plan turn-key sessions. All of the attendance sheets, agendas, and sign in sheets are 
maintained and archived in the Professional Development Binder. 
  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Our school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning 
and decision-making in support of the education of their children.  Parents are encouraged to 
actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of our school community.  Our school 
supports parents and families of all students by: 
*Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their 
achievement level (literacy, math and use of technology)      

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
*Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in 
planning and decision making in support of the education of their children     
*Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively 
support and monitor their child’s progress 
*Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and 
assessments 
*Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in 
a format, and in languages that parents can understand 
Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents 
to improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger 
ties between parents and other members of our school community. Parent workshops are held on 
Tuesday afternoons during Parent Engagement Time by grade level teachers and support staff in 
response to the  Parent Interest Survey that is distributed to parents during Back to School Night. 
These surveys provide the staff with information regarding the needs of our parents. Teachers on 
each grade level, as well as support staff work together collaboratively to plan various 
workshops throughout the school year which are directly geared toward meeting the needs stated 
in the Parent Interest Survey.. Additionally, our PTA provides parent workshops at various 
school events throughout the school year. three different times during the spring to help keep 
parents/guardian be more involved in their child's education. Furthermore, our Title I Parent 
Representative plans various workshops to meet the needs of parent based upon Parent Interest 
Surveys. Two workshops currently planned by the Title I Parent Representative are: 
Understanding Bullying vs. Conflict on November 4,2018 and Understanding the Rules of 
Engagement of Social Media / Technology on January 4, 2019. These workshops are being 
presented by Sara Steinweiss, founder of Conflict Resolution Systems. There will translators 
available at the sessions to assist as needed. 
All letters and invites are translated into the parents' preferred languages either through the 
Translation Services or from staff members that are fluent in those languages.   
Additionally, the Parent Coordinator supports the teaching staff including the ENL support 
teachers. She works closely with the members of the  school community including the PTA 
which represents all language subgroups. She coordinates parent workshops and collaborates 
with the PTA and staff on school events such as Family Fridays (parents are invited on the first 
Friday of each month into their child's classroom to assist in classroom activities), movie night, 
book fair, and plant sale all of which parents and guardians are welcome to volunteer.  are sent 
home (which are translated) with a reminder of these events, as well as a monthly school 
calendar, and the McKinley Monthly, the school newsletter.  
Our school community embraces parental involvement by engaging parents in every aspect of 
school life. Parents are not only involved in the Parent Teacher Association, they are also 
involved in many school events, including the Multi-Cultural Festival, Family Fridays (The first 
Friday of every month), Cupcake Friday (The first Friday of every month) , Donuts for Dads 
(two times a year), Muffins for Moms (two times a year), Sports Night (May), Movie Night (Fall 
and Spring), Dance Festival (June), Relay For Life (June), Plant Sales (May), Book Sales (Fall 
and Spring), Holiday Sales (December), Picture Day(October) School Carnival (May), and so 
much more. All notices about events, as well as other letters to communicate with families are 
translated into the home languages of our families. Translation services as well as teachers and 
paraprofessional proficient in another language assist at these school-wide events, as well as 
individual parent communication. Attendance is taken at these events and sheets are maintained 
and archived by the PTA. All letters and invites are translated into the parents' preferred 
languages either through the Translation Services or from staff members that are fluent in those 
languages.  
Additionally, in order to emphasize the focus of “Parents as Partners” all teachers commit to 
planning classroom celebrations during the school year which include the children's families. All

of these practices help to foster an environment where the school partners with families to reach 
the expectations of the Common Core and those set by the school community. 
Tuesday parental involvement time is utilized as a way for teachers to conduct parent outreach 
face to face or by phone regarding student performance and progress. This is in addition to the 
four contractual parent teacher meetings held throughout the school year. In addition to parent 
communication during this time on Tuesday afternoons, staff members provide workshop for 
parents to keep them informed. Grade level teams are providing workshops to all parents to assist 
them in helping their children succeed. During one of the Tuesday afternoon parent engagement 
sessions, two of our ENL teachers, along with the SETSS teacher and Speech Provider facilitated 
a workshop for parents designed to support parents with reading strategies for struggling 
learners. 
All all events that parent attend, there are sign-in sheets in order for us to keep accurate 
attendance records. These sign-in sheets are collected and maintained by our Parent Coordinator. 
Progress reports are used to keep parents informed of their child’s academic progress. McKinley 
Monthly, a monthly newsletter is completed and distributed each month providing all families 
with a blurb from all school constituents. Translations are always provided. Our school website 
is also available to all families. 
A Parent Interest Survey is issued to determine what types of workshops they are interested in 
attending. These interest surveys are completed at Back to School Night on September 17, 2019. 
Once the surveys are analyzed by grades and departments, workshops will be planned and will 
be scheduled throughout he 2018-2019 school year according to the needs and interests. 
Increased use in the translation services and communication tools to strengthen the home-school 
connection. Parents are invited to create an account on the NYC Schools account in order to have 
access to student data to keep them informed about academics, attendance and biographical 
information.  ThinkCentral, an on-line component of our literacy and math programs is 
accessible to parents and children. Therefore, workshops will  scheduled during the month of 
October to assist parents on how to navigate this useful resource. Parents are invited to 
Curriculum Conferences and grade-specific workshops to obtain information about curricula, 
including CCLS and Instructional Shifts during Open School Week.  
As a school community, we firmly believe that when schools and families work together to 
support learning, that parental involvement can have great impact on the performance and 
achievement of students. The P.S 127 staff collaborates to help create an enriching and 
supportive environment for all students and families, with the dedication to help meet the 
individual needs of our diverse population of students.  
Parents of our newly enrolled ELLs and immigrant students are invited to the mandated ENL 
Parent Orientation meeting where they are informed of the three program models available in 
NYC. The over-the-phone Translation and Interpretation services, as well as, staff members with 
common home language are utilized when needed to translate imperative information to 
parents.   In addition, all letters and forms regarding ELLs distributed to parents: Parent Surveys 
and Program Selection forms, Parent Brochures, Entitlement/non-entitlement letters, as well as, 
updated  Orientation videos are presented in their home language.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
To assess the early literacy skills of our English Language Learners (ELLs), our school utilizes several assessment tools. The 
primary assessment tool used is the Fountas and Pinnell (F&P) Benchmark Assessment system.  Key components of the F&P 
assessment system provide valuable information regarding the literacy skills of ELLs including phonological awareness, letter, 
sound, and high frequency word recognition and early literacy behaviors such as identifying a particular letter or word, and 
matching sounds as they are pronounced aloud. It provides English as a New Language (ENL) and classroom teachers insight 
regarding reading and comprehension levels and reading accuracy which aid in grouping students according to their 
needs.    Classroom teachers use many different sources of data to address the individual needs of all of our students including 
ELL, such as Performance Tasks in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics (Math), running records, conference notes, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 

Fundations and Wilson assessments. In grades K-2 , classroom teachers utilize the Beginning of the Year (BOY) and End of the 
Year (EOY) performance tasks to measure individual student's growth in ELA and Mathematics. In grades 3-5, classroom 
teachers use additional assessment tools such as the CCLS –Aligned Fall and Spring Benchmark Assessments from Schoolnet in 
both ELA and Math. The Journeys unit and benchmark assessments in grades K-5 are used to accurately diagnose individual 
student needs in reading and measure progress during the course of the school year.  In addition, Go Math! assessments in 
grades K-5 are used to assess the math skills and instructional needs of individual students, offering tiered intervention 
strategies to use with students.    Teacher Teams work collaboratively around data to meet the individual needs of students, 
including our ELL population and plan targeted instruction. As a result, teacher teams continue to strengthen decoding skills, 
phonemic awareness, vocabulary development and writing skills for all grade spans, especially for our ELL population. We are 
currently utilizing the Journeys Reading Program for all our students in grades K-5 to provide them with another successful 
method to help master reading, writing, and vocabulary skills.  We also utilize the Sadlier Common Core Vocabulary Workshop 
in our Grades 1-5 classrooms and the Sadlier Common Core Phonics Workshop in Kindergarten. Although our students 
demonstrate great growth in the area of listening and speaking on the NYSESLAT , they will need to make improvements in 
their reading and writing skills. We will continue to focus on providing our ELL population with meaningful scaffolded 
opportunities in reading and writing to help them reinforce literacy skills.   Teachers will continue to focus on developing their 
students' reading and writing skills by providing scaffolded differentiated instruction. In addition , an ELL component to the 
Journeys Reading Program will continue to be used in classrooms to provide additional reinforcement of the literacy skills they 
are working on. Furthermore, teachers will continue to focus on engaging our students in meaningful listening and speaking 
activities that are geared towards meeting the needs of all students.  Additional opportunities for literacy development in the 
various reading and writing genres will be provided throughout the school year.  Students will also be invited to participate in 
the supplemental programs such as the Title III ENL program pending funding. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Electronic Data folders are utilized by all classroom teachers and service providers. These data sources are reviewed by 
administration three times a year for all students: In the Fall, the Winter, and the Spring. These data folders monitor student 
progress in ELA, Math, and Performance Tasks for classroom teachers, as well as ELL data folders which measure progress in 
Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing. Additionally, teachers track student progress through end of unit benchmark 
assessments in all other content areas. Progress reports are sent home every other month to ensure continuous monitoring of 
student progress and parent communication to foster the home-school connection 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 
The success of the programs for English Language Learners in our school is closely monitored through informal and formal 
observations, collegial conversations, student work, assessment results, and progress monitoring data folders.The following 
assessments are also used to evaluate the success of our ELLs: NYSESLAT, NYS ELA/Math/Science exams,  Journeys Benchmark 
Assessments, Go Math! assessments, conference notes, collaborative assessment of student progress discussed at teacher - 
service provider meetings, classroom math and reading data folders , writing samples, student projects, and other student-
created work products. English Language Learners must also make the Annual Measureable Achievement Objectives (AMAOs). 
The EDAT allows our school to project our status through the 2017-18school year. The data will help us to focus on the 
progress toward achievement of proficiency for specific subgroups of ELLs and the design of effective instructional programs 
and/or interventions for those students. The factors that we analyzed include home language, grade level, years of ENL 
service, ELA and Math performance and progress, NYSESLAT proficiency and progress, attendance age , holdover status, SIFE 
status and disability classification. The variety of data  inform the teachers of the students’ strengths as well as areas for 
improvement. Teachers at P.S. 127 are in constant communication with one another which allows them to consistently gain 
insight through idea sharing and collaborative planning. Our 2015-2016 progress report reflects that our school is in good 
standing and has made AYP for our population of ELLs. According to the 2015-2016 School Quality Guide our ELLs made the 
following progress on ELA State test results : of the 60 Ell's that were eligible to take the ELA, 2.37  are meeting the 2016/17 
targets, and 2.47 of the students are exceeding the target of student achivement. In regards to the NYS Math exam , of the 62 
stduents that were eligible to take the exam, 2.75 are meeting the target, and 2.90 are exceeding the 2016/17 targets of 
student achievment.In regard to ELL progress,of the 152 ELL's eligible for NYS exams,  28.7% are in the range needed for our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

school to achieve a rating of Exceeding Target, Meeting Target, or Approaching Target on each metric for the 2015-16 school 
year. More specifically, the School Quality guide indicates that 48.4% of the ELL population are "Approaching Target", 58.4% 
are "Meeting Target", and 65.9% are "Exceeding Target" 
 
Overall, our ELL Progress according to the School Quality Guide for 2015-16 indicates a metric rating of Exceedin Target (and a 
metric score of 4.00 or higher) 
 According to data from the 2017 NYSESLAT , in terms of ELL progress the results were as follows: 
Of the 132 ELLs eligible for the NYSESLAT 23.5% of the test takers scored commanding. of the 132 students who were eligible 
to take the NYSESLAT, 45 students advanced 1 proficiency level, 9 students advanced 2 proficiency levels, 1 student advanced 
3 proficiency level and 22 students remained at the same proficiency level. 
 
We can ensure that the programs for our ELLs and their language acquisition needs are provided with targeted instruction 
designed to match their learning needs. We know that addressing the needs of our ELLs  takes the collaboration of the entire 
school school community. Our teachers are given the support needed in order to provide differentiated instruction and meet 
the needs of our ELLs. In addition, we believe that all students will succeed when they are kept to high expectations. The 
culture of learning in our school communicates  a clear vision with high expectations to "Believe, Achieve, and Succeed". We 
closely monitor the progress of the current Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) students using the same tools and 
assessments listed above. However, in addition to the formal and informal performance based assessments outlined, we are 
also use the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) to determine continued eligibility for 
the TBE program. Students scoring at the Commanding level are placed in monolingual classrooms at the start of the new 
school year.    
   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

At PS 127 we hold bi-weekly RTI and PPT meeting in which  we review at-risk student data and plan to provide additional 
supports for theses at-risk students. If a student is identified at-risk, we meet with the parents, an RTI cycle is implemented for 
8 weeks. After the 8 weeks, we meet again to review student data and plan next steps and discuss the possibility for PPT. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
To provide ELLs with rigorous and culturally responsive instruction, a strong Response to Intervention (RtI) model is in place at 
our school. Professional development and guidance documents have been provided to assist all teachers with RtI 
implementation. Therefore, all members of our school community understand that RtI is an instructional model which aims at 
prevention and early intervention through a tiered system of instructional support. 
Teachers consistently use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the RtI framework. Teachers provide instruction for ELLs in 
English language development at the Tier 1 instructional level. Then, students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3, if they demonstrate 
a need for more targeted and intensive academic support. This extra support can occur in the classroom, but also in separate 
settings with instruction focused on specific learning targets. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction incorporates intervention strategies 
and is tailored to meet ELLs’ language needs.  Teacher teams meet regularly to analyze data, reflect on teaching practices, 
adjust lessons and tasks, as well as, make further instructional decisions in order to meet the needs of all students. Teachers 
are familiar with the data points available to help determine exactly which ones provide us with the information needed to 
serve our English language learners who are at-risk for academic difficulties.  Members of our RtI team meet twice a month to 
examine how ELLs' backgrounds and educational contexts are impacting on their academic achievement. At each meeting, 
individual student factors are discussed, as well as all assessment data. Team members focus on the needs of individual 
students while discussing baseline screening, instructional strategies, various levels of interventions, and progress monitoring. 
Based on the NYCDOE RtI model, teachers develop and implement an individual intervention plan for 6-8 weeks which includes 
evidence-based differentiated instruction to meet the ELLs' diverse needs. This instruction is focused on promoting language 
and literacy development. Following the 6-8 week cycle of Tier 2 intervention, the RtI team revisits and discusses the success 
of the intervention through tiered layers of instructional support. Students who need intensive and individualized instruction 
will receive Tier 3 of instructional support.  In order to support academically at-risk ELLs teacher teams evaluate collectively 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

 

and have ongoing conversations about the different models of prevention that will meet the needs of diverse populations of 
learners, including ELLs at-risk for academic difficulties.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns across performance levels reveal a consistent progression of English Language skills in the areas of listening, 
speaking, reading and writing. As students move from one grade level to the next, there is a decrease in the number of entitled 
ELLs being serviced. In the 2016/2017 school year, 23.5% (31 students) of our entititled ELL students attained proficiency on 
the 2017 NYSESLAT. According to the ELL DATA Analysis Tool (EDAT) 45 students advanced one proficiency level, 9 students 
advanced 2 proficiency levels, 1 student advanced 3 proficiency levels, and 22 students remained at the same proficiency 
level.  
 
  In the Fall of 2017, we administered the NYSITELL to our newly enrolled potential ELLs. After reviewing their updated  HLIS 
(Home Language Identification Survey) and conducting interviews during the registration process 53 students in Kindergarten, 
5 students in Grade 1, 1 students in Grade 2, 2 students in Grades 3, 4, 5 were tested.

that are geared towards meeting their language development needs .We are using the ENL component to our Journeys 
language arts program and provide AIS support to our grade three, four, and five ELLs who will be taking the ELA this coming 
Spring. We will continue to provide opportunities for literacy development in the various reading and writing genres.  Students 
will participate in the Title III after-school and Saturday programs when available.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 
We have four key structures in place to disseminate our assessment findings in order to make necessary adjustments to 
programs and instruction. The data is shared with all faculty  electronically unless otherwise stated.  The structures are as 
follows: 
 
ELL Data Assessment tool (EDAT) – updated monthly. The file is too large to share electronically therefore the file is saved on a 
USB and downloaded onto teacher’s computers on an individual basis. 
ATS Reports (e.g. RLAT, ITELL, and SLAB) – updated weekly or as needed 
Data Folders – updated fall, winter, and spring 
Progress Reports – updated every other month

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

         All eligible English Language Learners identified by the 2016 NYSESLAT, as well as the 2016 NYSITELL are provided 
with our Freestanding English as a New Language or the Chinese Transitional Bilingual Education class in 
Kindergarten. Beginning September 2015, there are five proficiency levels for Ells. The fifth level , 
Proficient/Commanding, will indicate that the student is a Former ELL. . Our Proficient/Commanding Ells will still be 
provided with  support and test sccomodations as outlined in CR Part 154 new requirments.   Students who 
score  below the cut score will be grouped by grade and proficiency level during Stand-alone ENL.          As per the 
revised CR Part 154, ELLs in the Entering and Emerging levels receive 180 minutes of Stand-alone ENL 
(Homogeneously grouped) taught by a certified TESOL teacher  and 180 minutes of integrated ENL (mixed proficiency 
levels in the same class) taught by a certified TESOL teacher and a certified elementary teacher. ELLs in the 
Transitioning level receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA (mixed proficiency levels taught by an TESOL teacher and 
an elementary school teacher, and 90 minutes in a Stand-alone ENL class taught by a certified TESOL teacher 
homogeneously grouped) .           At the Expanding level, ELLs receive 180 minutes in an Integrated ENL/ELA or content 
area taught by an TESOL teacher and a certified elementary teacher.  The Commanding ELLs have exited ELL status 
but will continue to  receive ENL support in a 90 minute integrated ENL/ELA or content area taught by a certified 
TESOL teacher and a certified elementary teacher  .           Each of our three certified ENL teachers are responsible for 
working with different grade ELL bands (K-1, 2-3, and 4-5) and levels.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 In September of 2016,  we opened up our first Chinese Transitional Bilingual Education Program. Upon enrolllment of 
Kindergarten students , parents are  notified of their childs eligibilty for ELL services and are invited to attend an 
orientation( in the parents' preferred language) which provides information of the three instructional models 
available in New York City. They view the Parent Orientation Video,  which is available in thirteen languages and 
further explains the three program chioces. Parents are then provided with the Parent Survey & Selection Form (in 
the parents' preferred language) where they indicate their preferred program choice for child. At present, twenty four 
parents indicated that they would prefer their child be placed in a Transitional Bilingual Education class, therefore we 
opened the required TBE Mandarin classroom.As per CR Part 154, students in the TBE class receive mandated Home 
Language Arts, English Language Arts , and ENL instruction and support.   As the student's English proficiency level 
increases, more of instructional day will be taught in English with less instruction in their home language (Mandarin). 
When Ells reach a Commanding level of language proficiency based on  the NYSESLAT, they will be placed in a 
monolingual English class and will be provided  with 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or content area support 
provided for two years  by a certified TESOL teacher and a certified elementary teacher.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

At the current time, we do not have any Dual Language programs. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 All eligible English Language Learners identified by the 2016 NYSESLAT, as well as the 2016 NYSITELL are provided with our 
Freestanding  English as a New Language.  Beginning September  2015, there are currently 5 proficiency levels for ELLs. The 
fifth level, Proficient Commanding, will indicate that the student is a Former ELL. Our Proficient/Commanding Former ELLs will 
still be provided with English Native Language support according to the CR Part 154.2  new requirements.  Students who 
score  below the cut score will be grouped by grade and proficiency level during Stand-alone ENL.   As per the revised CR Part 
154, ELLs in the Entering and Emerging levels receive 180 minutes of Stand-alone ENL (Homogeneously grouped) taught by a 
certified TESOL teacher  and 180 minutes of integrated ENL (mixed proficiency levels in the same class) taught by a certified 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80 

 

TESOL teacher and a certified elementary teacher. ELLs in the Transitioning level receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA 
(mixed proficiency levels taught by an TESOL teacher and an elementary school teacher. and 90 minutes in a Stand-alone ENL 
class taught by a certified TESOL teacher homogeneously grouped) .    At the Expanding level, ELLs receive 180 minutes in an 
Integrated ENL/ELA or content area taught by an TESOL teacher and a certified elementary teacher.   The Commanding ELLs 
receive ENL support in a 90 minute integrated ENL/ELA or content area taught by a certified TESOL teacher and a certified 
elementary teacher.    Each of our three certified ENL teachers is responsible for working with different grade ELL bands (K-1, 
2-3, and  4-5) and levels. The Chinese Transitional Bilingual Kindergarten class receives their mandated ENL  minutes within the 
regular classroom setting. The teacher of this class is a certified Common Branch teacher, she is fluent in Mandarin and is an 
approved participant in the program sponsored by the Department of Education for her bilingual extension. The daily 
instruction included Home Language Arts (HLA) period per day, ELA (Reading and Writing) in English only, 1 period daily of 
Math 50 % in English and 50% in Chinese, as well as Science and Social Studies 50 % in English and 50% in Chinese. All other 
content areas: Art, Physical Education, Music, Dance, and Enrichment Through the Arts in taught in English. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  The Chinese Transitional Bilingual Kindergarten class receives their mandated minutes of ENL instruction within the regular 
classroom setting. The teacher of this class is a certified Common Branch teacher, she is fluent in Mandarin and is an approved 
participant in the program sponsored by the Department of Education for her bilingual extension. The daily instruction 
included Home Language Arts(HLA) period per day in which books have been purchase through an approved DOE vendor, 
China Sprout. Books are used for Home Language Arts (HLA) that go along with the themes, skills, and topics of 
our ELA program, Journeys, our Math program, Go Math!, as well as the Science and Social Studies Scope and 
Sequence.  ELA (Reading and Writing) are taught in English only, 1 period daily of Math is taught 50 % in English and 50% in 
Chinese, as well as Science and Social Studies 50 % are taught in English and 50% in Chinese. All other content areas: Art, 
Physical Education, Music, Dance, and Enrichment Through the Arts in taught in English. Classroom general and special 
education teachers, content-area teachers, special education support teachers, support service providers, and ENL teachers 
work collaboratively to ensure that core content is effectively delivered to all students. Planning and preparation is essential to 
a successful differentiated lesson in which multiple entry points are used, tiered questions are readily asked, varied levels of 
tasks are prepared, and supplemental resources are accessible if needed. To meet the demands of the Common Core Learning 
Standards while fostering the student's language development, a tiered system of instructional support is in place. This allows 
layers of instructional support to be added to the standard core curriculum based on the demonstrated and changing needs of 
the student learners. All students are provided with instruction at the Tier 1 instructional level. If students demonstrate a need 
for more targeted academic support, they will be moved into Tier2 and Tier 3 for more intensive instruction. Teachers use a 
variety of resources and materials intended to address the diverse needs of our ELL population, in order to make language and 
content comprehensible.  Each classroom library is stocked with many leveled books in an assortment of genres to make sure 
students have the opportunity to read a variety of books at their specific reading levels to support their learning across the 
content areas.  Throughout the content areas, the use of visuals (such as maps, charts, and pictures), graphic organizers (such 
as KWL charts and Venn diagrams) helps teachers in making content and language accessible to our ELL students.   We are 
aware of the importance of building background knowledge and by making content comprehensible through modeling, 
gestures, and hands-on learning, as well as pre-teaching important vocabulary terms, especially in the content areas of 
science, math, and social studies.  Content areas are taught in English using ENL strategies. There is the additional use of 
bilingual dictionaries, books and photo collections translated in several languages word-to word dual language glossaries 
offered in math, science and social studies, Buddy System , paraprofessional's language assistance to support our ELLs in their 
native language.  The ENL program incorporates several approaches and methods to make content comprehensible and to 
enrich language development.               The ENL program incorporates several approaches and methods to make content 
comprehensible and to enrich language development. Prominent among the teaching approaches is the Natural Approach. In 
the Natural Approach, teachers provide language input that learners can understand. Comprehension is facilitated by using 
visual aids, gestures, commands for physical actions (e.g. Total Physical Response), sentence expansions, open-ended 
sentences,  pre-fabricated phrases, and native language support. Native language support is facilitated through a student 
buddy system (children of same language assisst an ELL in various subject areas).   Content area instruction will be presented 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81 

 

using the Natural Approach technique. Therefore, conceptual learning will be combined with language learning. When 
appropriate, the Language Experience Approach, as well as Total Physical Response methodology will be employed in the ESL 
instructional program. Teachers utilize differentiated instructional approaches so that ELL students receive the support that 
they need.   Our school utilizes a combination of the Balanced Literacy Approach in conjunction with, Journeys 
Reading/Writing Language Arts program. Our school has implemented the Go Math! program which is aligned to the Common 
Core Standards. This program is designed to facilitate differentiated instruction and activities, including built-in vocabulary 
support in every unit. Additionally, each lesson includes suggestions for instructional strategies to support English Language 
Learners.  These programs are available through ThinkCentral and offers many valuable resources to support our families at 
home. The ENL teachers are using Rigby’s On Our Way to English program, which provides grade level and content-based 
thematic instruction focused on the specific needs of ELLs on various proficiency levels and is aligned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards. In addition, the ENL teachers are following the ELL component of the Journeys Reading/Language Arts 
program so that the literacy and language arts activities in the mainstream classroom and the ENL classroom are aligned with 
one another. Reading and writing are taught as natural extensions of oral communication tasks.  Across the vast majority of 
classrooms, teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best 
that is informed by the Danielson Framework for Teaching and the Instructional Shifts, as well as by discussions at team and 
school level meetings. Teaching strategies (including questioning, scaffolds in English and/or native language where 
appropriate, and routines) strategically provide multiple entry points and high quality supports and extensions into the 
curricula so that all learners, including ELLs and SWDs, are engaged in appropriately challenging tasks and demonstrate higher-
order thinking skills in student work products.       
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

.  
   Newly enrolled English Language Learners who score below proficiency level on the NYSITELL and speak Spanish at home are 
administered a Spanish Language Assessment Battery (LAB) once by a Spanish-speaking pedagogue within the first ten (10) 
days  of initial enrollment; to determine language dominance. All ELLs in grades 3-5 are required to take the New York State 
Mathematics and Science exams.  ELLs may take the mathematics and science tests in English or an alternative language - 
whichever better meets their linguistic needs. Currently, the New York State Department of Education offers each of these 
exams in Chinese (Traditional), Haitian Creole and Spanish. The Mathematics exams are also available in Korean and Russian. 
When possible, arrangements are made for the  test to be translated orally into other languages for ELLs whose first language 
is one for which a written translation is not available from the New York State Department of Education. This year, our school 
will make necessary accommodations for newly enrolled ELLs not capable of completing the exam in English. We will provide 
Arabic translated versions of the 3-5 grade NYS Mathematics exam and an Arabic- speaking ENL teacher will provided newly 
enrolled ELLs with an oral translation of the NYS Math exams . In all classroom environments, including ENL Stand-alone model 
and Integrated ENL/ELA  models,  students are given native language reading materials, when available. Instructional materials 
and books are standards-based and age appropriate.  Students' native language written work samples and oral responses  may 
be analyzed by the classroom teachers (ENL teachers, classroom teachers, Special Education teachers) with assistance from 
paraprofessionals who are fluent in the child's home language. ELLs’ home and community literacy practices and funds of 
knowledge should be valued as resources for literacy learning at school. Devising activities and projects that are related to 
students’ lives at home or in their neighborhoods is likely to increase students’ motivation and literacy success.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

All teachers work colloboratively to plan lessons and prepare student tasks which are differentiated to meet the needs of 
our diverse learners.  All teachers are engaged in inquiry work which allows them to analyze data in order to gain information 
of student strengths and challenges. Strategies are discussed while creating a plan for implementation. The cycle of inquiry 
continues throughout the year to provide a supportive environment and tailored support in order to improve student 
achievement.    Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) are ELLs born in a country other than the United States who 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82 

 

enter the English Language School System (ELSS) in grade 3 or above, have had two years less schooling than their peers in 
their native countries, and function at least two years below expected grade level in reading and mathematics.  The school and 
staff have implemented an instructional plan which encompasses employing a Newcomer’s program, adapting curriculum and 
standards to the SIFE’s individualized needs.  The SIFE student would participate in our Free-Standing ESL program in a grade-
appropriate group, thus receiving the mandated number of ENL instruction minutes as determined by his/her proficiency level. 
We extend all opportunities for the students in grades 3-5 to participate in programs such as, the Title III ELL 
Academy.           Our newcomer ELLs participate in our Freestanding ENL program with placement in the grade-appropriate 
groups where they receive the mandated number of minutes as per CR-Part 154.2, based on their proficiency levels.  Our ELLs 
receiving 0-3 ESL services in grades kindergarten through first take part in a Wilson Fundation Program that provides additional 
reinforcement of phonics, phonemic awareness and other early literacy skills. In addition to Wilson Fundations, students in 
grade one receive targeted small group instruction from the English Language Learner component of the Journeys 
Reading/Language Arts program to reinforce phonics.  Our newcomer ELL’s in grade 2, receive targeted small group instruction 
from the English Language Learner component of the Journeys literacy  program. Our ELL’s in grades 3-5 who are required to 
take the NYS ELA exam may receive services in our AIS programs where they receive targeted small group instruction. In 
addition, they are invited to participate in our Test Prep Academy offered before the start of our regular instrcutional school 
day  approximatley six-eight weeks prior to NYS ELA and Math exams; where students are immersed in rigorous test prep in 
order to review skills and strategies needed to reinforce what they need to know to succeed at taking the NYS tests. The exact 
number of sessions offered to students for ELA and Math are contingent upon school budget.Our  ELLs receiving  services for 
four to six years participate in our Freestanding ENL program with placement in the grade appropriate groups where they 
receive the mandated number of minutes as per CR-Part 154.2 , based on their proficiency levels.  ELLs in this category may 
receive services in our AIS programs, where targeted small group instruction is designed to strengthen their literacy, math and 
content area skills. They are engaged in small group instruction which reinforces their English language skills, as well as 
developing their literacy and content area skills. Additionally, ELLs in grades 3-5 are invited to participate in a  differentiated 
Test Prep program offered during the week and on Saturdays prior to the NYS ELA and Math exams. Students are grouped 
accordingly and immersed in rigorous test prep in order to review skills and strategies needed to reinforce what they need to 
know to succeed at taking the NYS tests.  In the past two years, we have offered our ELLs to participate in a supplemental ELL 
Academy.  During this time, teachers worked with children from Grades 1 through 5 in small groups to reinforce 
English acquisition skills, as well as, develop reading and writing skills needed to succeed on the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math 
exams.   Classroom teachers and ENL teachers analyze test scores, progress or stagnation of students, and may meet with the 
School Assessment Team (SAT) to look into possible evaluation and assess if an individual student is need of mandated services 
such as speech or alternative classroom setting  to provide them with the optimal learning environment to help them achieve 
their fullest potential.             Our long-term ELLs participate in our Freestanding ENL program with placement in the grade-
appropriate groups where they receive the mandated number of minutes as per CR-Part 154.2 , based on their proficiency 
levels. We offer these students opportunities to participate in programs such as academic intervention services, ELL 
supplemental program,  and Test Prep Academy.               We recognize that ELLs who have attained proficiency on the 
NYSESLAT (Former ELLs) are in need of additional transitional support to continue to progress academically. In addition to their 
mandated 90 minutes a week of integrated ESL for 2 years after testing out, our former ELLs receive AIS services for additional 
literacy, math and content area support.   They are invited to participate in our Test Prep Academy offered prior to taking state 
exams. Additionally, during the NYS ELA and Math exams,  former ELLs receive the recommended ELL accommodations  for up 
to two years. Accommodations include extended time, separate location and/or small group administration, use of NYS word-
to-word glossaries offered in fifteen languages, after attaining proficiency on the NYSESLAT as per the NYS Department of 
Education regulations.       
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs with disabilities (ELL-SWD) participate in our Freestanding ENL program with placement in the grade-appropriate groups 
where they receive the mandated number of minutes as per CR-Part 154.2, based on their proficiency levels. At the present 
time,  we have twenty-seven (27) ELL-SWDs enrolled in our school. Our ELL-SWD students receive all services and 
modifications as indicated on their Individualized Education Plan (IEP), including speech, occupational therapy, and Special 
Education teaching support services (SETSS). ENL teachers and classroom teachers are provided with a variety of resources and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83 

 

materials intended to address the diverse needs of our ELL-SWDs population in order to provide them with access to academic 
content areas and to make language and content comprehensible. Our ENL programs use strategies for English language 
development with native language support (use of bilingual dictionaries, buddy system, word for word dual language 
glossaries, photo library with multi-lingual translations) in order for students to develop language and content knowledge in 
English. Each classroom library is stocked with many leveled books in an assortment of genres to make sure students have the 
opportunity to read a variety of books at their specific reading levels to support their learning across the content areas. During 
lessons the use of Smartboards, visuals (such as maps, charts, and pictures), and graphic organizers (such as KWL charts and 
Venn diagrams) help teachers in making content and language accessible to our ELL-SWDs. We are aware of the importance of 
building background knowledge and making content comprehensible through modeling, gestures, and hands-on learning, as 
well as, pre-teaching important vocabulary terms,especially in the content areas of science, math, and social studies.  Content 
areas are taught in English using ENL strategies.Additionally, teachers use a multi-sensory teaching approach, helping the ELL-
SWDs to learn through more than one of the senses.When possible, content area instruction is presented using the Natural 
Approach technique. Therefore, conceptual learning is combined with language learning. When appropriate, the Language 
Experience Approach as well as the Total Physical Response methodology will be employed. Teachers utilize differentiated 
instructional approaches to ensure ELLs receive additional supports as needed.       
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
As per individual students' IEPs,  some ELL-SWDs are placed in an ICT class setting. ELL-SWDs are programmed in ICT classes 
where they are mainstreamed with the general education population and receive further academic, social and linguistic 
support which offers them opportunities to learn in the least restrictive environment.   In some instances, paraprofessionals 
work closely with these students to help ensure that their specific educational needs are accommodated. ELLs in this category 
may receive services which is discussed at the Response to Intervention Team meetings as well as the Pupil Personnel Team 
meetings. Such services may include support from our AIS and SETSS providers. Targeted small group instruction is designed to 
strengthen their literacy, math and content area skills. They are also given the opportunity to participate in a supplemental ELL 
Academy where small group instruction focuses on reinforcing their English language skills, as well as, developing their literacy 
and content area skills.  
Additionally, all  ELLs in grades 3-5 are invited to participate in our Test Prep program offered prior to the NYS ELA and Math 
exams. Students are grouped accordingly and immersed in rigorous test prep in order to review skills and strategies needed to 
reinforce what they need to know when administered the NYS tests. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
As stated above, our newcomer ELLs participate in our Freestanding ENL program with placement in the grade-appropriate 
groups. Our school is aware of our ELLs’ varying needs in their linguistic development and when making instructional decisions, 
we are mindful of the challenges that ELLs may encounter in the areas of literacy development. When considering program 
choices and instructional decisions, we know that is is important to provide ELLs with multiple entry points into the curriculum, 
audio-visual support, native language support (through buddy system and word to word bilingual glossaries, photo libraries 
with multilingual translations), differentiated activities according to linguistic  needs, and vocabulary building instruction. 
While not all students will achieve the same level of language, literacy, and content area development, all will be moving 
toward the same goal along different paths. Our reading, writing and math programs provide differentiated instruction, varied 
strategies and multiple entry points which are built into lessons and provide opportunities for all language learners to 
succeed. ELLs receive  the mandated number of minutes as per CR-Part 154.2  based on their proficiency levels.  Our ELLs 
receiving 0-3 years in ENL services in grades kindergarten through first take part in a Wilson Fundations Program that provides 
additional reinforcement of phonics, phonemic awareness and other early literacy skills.  Our newcomer ELLs in grade 2 
receive targeted small group instruction from the English Language Learner component of the Journeys literacy program. Our 
newcomer ELLs in grades 3-5 who are required to take the NYS ELA receive services in our AIS programs where they receive 
targeted small group instruction. In addition, they are invited to participate in our Test Prep program prior to the 
administration of the NYS ELA and Math exams. The exact number of sessions offered to students for ELA and Math are 
contingent upon school budget. Entering and Emerging ELLs in grades 1-5 receive phonemic and phonological instruction 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          84 

 

through the multi-sensory, kinesthetic , phonics based Orton Gillingham Approach. This instructional approach helps our 
students master the basic knowledge about the English language and its relationship to our writing system. ELLs in the Entering 
and Emerging levels use Imagine Learning. Imagine Learning is an engaging language and literacy software program that 
accelerates English learning. The program focuses on oral language, academic vocabulary, instruction in the five essential 
components of reading, and provides strategic native language support.  Our ELLs receiving services for four to six years 
participate in our Freestanding ENL program with placement in the grade-appropriate groups where they receive the 
mandated number of minutes as per CR Part 154.2  based on their proficiency levels. ELLs in this category may receive services 
in our AIS programs, where targeted small group instruction is designed to strengthen their literacy,  math and content area 
skills. They are given an opportunity  participate in a supplemental ENL Academy where small group instruction focuses on 
reinforcing their English language skills, as well as, developing their literacy and content area skills. Additionally, ELLs in grades 
3-5 are invited to participate in our Test Prep program to further develop their literacy, math and test-taking skills while 
offering additional opportunities to practice for state exams in a small group setting.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

  
Currently grades K-5  are using the Journeys reading program and Go Math! program. These programs are aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards. The Journeys program has an ELL component that focuses on scaffolded activities for 
different ELL levels. Journeys includes complex text and high levels of questioning that promote higher order thinking. 
      
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Currently P.S. 127 has no plans to discontinue any programs or services implemented since evidence shows that the 
program  successfully supports the needs of our ELL population. We will continue to engage in professional development , 
inquiry work and monitor the success of all of our programs and services to ensure that our ELLs are afforded equal 
opportunities to learning which contributes to their progress. 
    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
  
English Language Learners are always encouraged and afforded equal access to all school programs. Throughout the year, they 
participate in before school, after school, and Saturday programs which provide our ELLs with additional support needed to 
progress. During lessons, they are encouraged to participate in student-to-student discussions and engage in all student 
activities. They receive constant exposure to technology instruction  in the classroom  through the use of SmartBoards, laptop 
computers, audio-listening centers and overhead projectors. ELLs participate in small group instruction, one-to-one 
conferencing, targeted instruction services, as well as, enrichment activities such as Reader's Theater. They participate in class 
assemblies and publishing parties. All ELLs are invited to participate in the Test Prep Programs, Title III ELL Academy, ballroom 
dancing, chorus, enrichment clubs, after-school activities and clubs such as Word Wizards,  and  the Young Dancers in 
Repertory after-school program. ThinkCentral also offers materials in Spanish for parents to access. Every effort is made to 
translate all notices and invitations sent to parents.  
     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
  
Our English Language Learners receive constant exposure to technology in the classroom through the use of SmartBoards, 
laptop computers, audio-listening centers and overhead projectors . Additionally, the Journeys and Go Math! programs are 
available on the on-line component, ThinkCentral which offers many valuable resources to further support students learning in 
the classrooms. In the content areas of Social Studies and Science, Smartboards are utilzed to enhance lessons and offer 
students access to additional resources and support. P.S. 127 is always striving to improve reading and writing skills, as well as, 
vocabulary development for our entire student population, including ELLs, in order to make content comprehensible.  Each 
classroom library is stocked with many leveled books in an assortment of genres to ensure students have the opportunity to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          85 

 

read a variety of books at their specific reading levels to support their learning across the content areas.  We greatly emphasize 
the use of many visuals from Rigby On Our Way to English programs and throughout the content areas (such as maps, charts, 
and pictures).  Graphic organizers (such as KWL charts and Venn diagrams) help teachers in making content and language 
accessible to our students. We are aware of the importance of building background knowledge and by making content 
comprehensible through modeling, gestures, and hands-on learning, as well as, pre-teaching important vocabulary terms, 
especially in the content areas of science,  math, and social studies.  Content areas are taught in English using ENL strategies. 
The use of bilingual dictionaries,  picture dictionaries, photo collections with multi-lingual translations, thematic flash cards, as 
well as word-to-word  dual language glossaries are offered across the content areas to provide native language support.  Our 
school utilizes a combination of the balanced literacy approach in conjunction with the Journeys literacy program.  In addition, 
the ENL teachers are following the ELL component of the Journeys literacy program for additional literacy support so that the 
literacy and language arts activities in the mainstream classroom and the ENL classroom are aligned with one 
another.  Reading and writing are taught as natural extensions of oral/aural communication tasks.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

P.S 127 understands the importance of offering many opportunities for ELLs to use and be exposed to their native language as 
a foundation of English Language acquisition and development. In our Freestanding English as a Native Language we provide 
word to word dual language  glossaries  and bilingual dictionaries for our ELL students.  Teachers implement a buddy system 
for all newcomer ELLs in their classrooms. The newcomers are paired with a buddy who is able to communicate in the same 
language to help ease the transition into classroom expectations and activities. They are able to speak to teachers or staff 
members that share their native language.  In addition, during cooperative group work, ELLs are grouped with other common 
language students, which offers them the chance to communicate and participate in the exchange of ideas.  We also use 
Google Translate with typing and microphone options. Currently, P.S 127 is looking to invest in the purchase of native language 
libraries to be placed in both mainstream and ENL classrooms. Additionally, we utilize the Translation Services through the 
DOE, as well as our bilingual staff to translate documents and letters that are sent home, to make phone calls home when 
needed, participate in Parent Teacher Conferences, and PTA meetings. Our school also utilized REMIND as a way to inform 
parents of upcoming events and send important reminder 
    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Based on the information provided above, support services and resources available to our ELL students correspond with their 
age and grade levels and are Common Core aligned. All classroom materials are aligned to students' current reading levels, 
content areas, and/or proficiency levels.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 We currently do not share or collocate. 
   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our Parent Coordinator meets with the families of newly enrolled students to conduct a school tour while discussing the 
content of the Parent Guide. Families of students who are ELL-SWDs are contacted by the Special Education support staff 
members to provide an opportunity for questions and answers. Teachers of ENL students plan the administration of the 
NYSITELL for newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year in order to discuss and plan for a program that will 
meet the needs of individual students. 
   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  
We do not currently offer language electives. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          86 

 

 

 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not currently offer Dual Language. However we use the ATS ELPC screen to maintain and organize 
parent selection choices.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
   
   
The goal of the administration is to provide all members of our school community with opportunities for professional 
development programs that support the academic gains and English language development of all of our students including 
English Language Learners . Our school has an instructional team which consists of the principal, the assistant principals, and 
each grade leader. The instructional team meets regularly to vertically discuss and share ideas, concerns, next steps using. All 
staff members are encouraged to attend outside professional development sessions offered by the district and outside 
agencies. Staff members who attend Professional Development complete a Professional Development Experience sheet which 
is used to plan for turn-keying information session with colleagues. This allows us to grow and develop professionally, continue 
to strengthen and refine current teaching practices. One of the Chancellor’s goals is to have all teachers involved in inquiry 
projects. Inquiry teams focus on student outcomes using a systematic, data-informed approach. It is conducted by teams of 
teachers with a focus on small groups of students, paying close attention to those who are struggling, SWDs and ELLs while 
supporting the learning of all students. All teachers are involved in inquiry teams and meet weekly to analyze data and plan 
next steps for implementing change strategies.  Our Brooklyn South Field Support Center, along with the OELL offers 
Professional Development opportunities to all teachers who work with ELLs. All licensed classroom teachers, service providers 
and paraprofessionals attend staff conferences and other professional development opportunities offered in and outside of 
the school building to ensure that they will able to provide the necessary support to assist all of our ELLs as they transition 
from one proficiency level to another. In addition to teaching our ELL population, our certified ENL teachers will provide in-
school staff development and support for common branch and special education classroom teachers, occupational/speech 
therapists and paraprofessionals regarding ENL methodologies and strategies, Professional development will emphasize the 
importance of providing ELLs with background knowledge and scaffolds to support their academic language proficiency 
needed to help ELLs grow and progress towards meeting Common Core Learning Standards.  Another goal is to provide P.S 127 
staff members with an understanding of the stages and process of language acquisition,  along with the various cultural and 
native language transfer factors that can impact the process. Our pupil-accounting secretary has attended professional 
development workshops provided by the NYC Department of Education which focuses on pertinent information regarding 
working with ELLs and their parents during the initial registration process, accessing vital information pertaining to ELLs 
through ATS, and the appropriate support involved in completing the updated Home Language Identification Survey 
(HLIS).  Our guidance counselor attended a professional development pertaining to a “Respect for All” anti-bullying initiative. 
The training touches upon several issues affecting ELLs including the need for multicultural awareness and sensitivity. One of 
the goals of this initiative is to help create an inclusive, welcoming school and classroom environment where children of all 
backgrounds can thrive.As mentioned above, our ENL, common branch/special education classroom teachers,  service 
providers and paraprofessionals attend staff development sessions in and outside of our school building to ensure that they 
will be able to assist our ELLs in all academic areas.  All teachers who participated in professional development workshops that 
touched upon the needs of our ELL population have also conducted turn-key staff development during staff conferences.  A 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          87 

 

minimum of 15% of the required professional development for all general education teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 will be 
dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and 
content instruction for English Language Learners. For all ENL teachers a minimum of 50% of the required PD hours will be 
dedicated to language acquistion in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-
teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners. A professional 
development schedule is maintained by our administration  and our school staff is required to sign in at all conferences to 
verify attendance.      This year our ELL coordinator and ENL teachers have attended  Professional Development sessions from 
the Borough Field Support Center and DELLS offered Professional Development opportunities to all teachers who work with 
ELLs. All licensed classroom teachers, service providers, and paraprofessionals attend staff conferences and other professional 
development opportunities offered in and outside of the school building to ensure that they will able to provide support to 
assist all of our ELLs as they transition from one proficiency level to another. In addition to teaching our ELL population, our 
certified ENL teachers will provide in-school staff development and support for common branch and special education 
teachers, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech therapists, and paraprofessionals regarding ENL methodologies 
and strategies with an emphasis on the importance of providing ELLs with background knowledge and scaffolds to support 
their academic language proficiency needed to help ELLs grow and progress towards meeting Common Core Learning 
Standards. We also participated in a Multilingual Learner Institute in which Dr. Rosa Delgado from Education Consortium 
provided hands on support and planning to teachers in a series of workshops. 
In addition, our ENL teachers facilitated staff development workshops which included: 
• Diving Deep into the EDAT - staff analyzed student information on the EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool) and its implications on 
ELL and State Assessments. 
• Enhancing Co-Teaching Practices – staff reviewed the Seven Co-Teaching Models and observed best practices in an 
integrated ENL classroom. 
• Getting to Know the NYSESLAT – staff reviewed samples of grade specific short response and extended response questions 
from ENGAGE NY. Another goal is to provide P.S. 127 staff members with an understanding of the stages and process of 
language acquisition,  along with the various cultural and native language transfer factors that can impact the process. ENL 
teachers will participate in  webinars such as, ELLs and Common Core Academic Standards: Successful Strategies for the 
Content Classroom, presented by Ron Rohac. This presentation offers practical tools for educators to address the Common 
Core State Standards' emphasis on literacy skills. It teaches reading strategies and vocabulary-building activities in core 
subjects like science, mathematics, and language arts. These strategies will prepare English learners to meet the CCSS, college 
and career readiness standards, and rigorous academic work. They are based on techniques Mr. Rohac has developed and 
tested with considerable success. The approach is based on SIOP methodology and has been proven to enhance ELL student 
ability and raise assessment scores. The webinar demonstrates  sequencing lesson plans using Universal Design for Learning  to 
maximize comprehension and encourage active participation for all proficiency levels. As mentioned above, our common 
branch teachers, special education teachers,  service providers, and paraprofessionals attend staff development in and outside 
of our school building to ensure that they will be able to assist our ELLs in all academic areas, and to ensure that of ELL training 
has been met for our teaching staff members who are not licensed ENL teachers.  In addition, general and special education 
teachers who have participated in professional development workshops that touched upon the needs of our ELL population 
have also conducted turn-key staff development during staff conferences. A professional development schedule is maintained 
by our administration and our school staff is required to sign in at all conferences to verify attendance.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
Our Guidance Counselor and Parent Coordinator provide continuous support to all our students including the ELL population. 
They assist all certified common branch and special education teachers and service providers of ELLs in fifth grade in 
supporting and easing the students' transition into middle school.  During the months of May and June, fifth grade teachers, 
Guidance Counselor and Parent Coordinator  collaboratively plan open discussions with fifth grade students to address their 
concerns and expectations of entering a new school environment. They receive pamphlets that further explain what to expect 
in middle school, as well as, organizational checklists to help students begin to think about study habits.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          88 

 

 

  
In addition, teachers of fifth grade and the Guidance Counselor escort and supervise inter-visitations of neighboring middle 
schools so that the students become familiar with the middle schools. Students are also invited to participate in an "I LOVE 
ME" assembly presented by a neighboring middle school they may attend. At this assembly, students receive further 
information on the specific school's policies and expectations. 
  
  
Our common branch teachers, special education teachers and service providers attend staff development in and outside of 
our school building to ensure that they will be able to assist our ELLs in all academic areas. A minimum of fifteen percent of the 
required professional development hours for all our teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 will be dedicated to language 
acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
our English Language Learners. For our English as a New Language teachers , a minimum of 50% of the required professional 
development hours will be  
dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction , including a focus on best practices for co-
teaching strategies and content instruction for English Language Learners.  In addition, classroom and special education 
teachers who have participated in professional development workshops that touched upon the needs of our ELL population 
will conduct a turn-key staff development during staff conferences. A professional development schedule plan is created and a 
schedule is  maintained by our administration and our school staff is required to sign in at all conferences to verify 
attendance.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, and quarterly progress meetings , our teachers including 
our  ENL teachers individually meet with parents to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development 
progress, their child's English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content 
areas.  As per our UFT Memorandum Agreement , a forty minute block of time on Tuesdays afternoons are dedicated to Parent 
Engagement meetings, activities, and events. Communication logs are maintained by all staff members. When needed, 
meetings are conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or 
guardian best understands. Every effort is made to ensure that parents complete all ELL documentation. Outreach attempts 
are tracked and maintained.  Our certified ENL teachers and Parent Coordinator ensure that continued entitlement and 
transitional support parent notification letters are distributed to the parents and collected. If the letters are not returned, the 
ENL teachers and Parent Coordinator make several attempts to contact the parents in the appropriate language by letters and 
telephone calls. A Parent Communication Log is maintained to track attempts made to reach out to the parents. Over the 
phone translations or staff members that speak the same language are used in the event that a parent needs a 
translator.        Each spring, our ELLs are tested to evaluate their English proficiency using the New York State English as a 
Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT). All students who are English language learners must take the NYSESLAT.  The 
NYSESLAT is designed to measure the English language proficiency of students who have been identified as ELLs and to 
determine their continued ELL status. Our ENL teachers send Continued Entitlement Letters to parents of students who 
continue to be entitled to ELL services (based on the NYSESLAT). Letters are sent to parents in the beginning of the school year 
in which the students continue to be entitled. Letters are sent in the preferred language of the parents.     

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  
Our school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support 
of the education of their children.  Parents are welcome to attend and are encouraged to participate during all school events, 
activities, and meetings. Throughout the school year, we have Family Fridays, Desserts Around the World, Career Day, 
Publishing Parties, Multi-Cultural Festival, Class Assemblies, Parent Workshops, etc. all of which foster a strong school-home 
partnership which supports families of all students. Additional school events include Donuts for Dad, Muffins for Moms, Sports

Night, Movie Night, Dance Festival, Carnival Day, Holiday Sales, Picture Day, Book Fairs, etc. all of which welcome parent 
participation.  A monthly newsletter, monthly calendar, student progress reports, and school website are accessible to all 
families.  Our Parent Coordinator serves as a liaison between the school and families.  The Parent Coordinator provides parent 
workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend our school and works to ensure that our school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents.  The Parent Coordinator maintains a log of events and activities planned 
for parents each month. Additionally, in order to emphasize the focus of “Parents as Partners” all teachers commit to planning 
classroom celebrations during the school year which include the children's families. All of these practices help to foster an 
environment where the school partners with families to reach the expectations of the Common Core and those set by the 
school community.  Tuesdays' Parent Engagement time is utilized as a way for teachers to conduct parent outreach face to 
face or by phone regarding student performance and progress. This is in addition to the four contractual parent teacher 
conferences held throughout the school year. In addition to parent communication, staff members provide workshops for 
families in order to keep them informed and provide the support needed to assist their children at home. A Parent Interest 
Survey is issued to determine what types of workshops they are interested in attending. Increased use in the translation 
services and communication tools to strengthen the home-school connection has been noted. Parents are invited to create an 
account on the NYC Schools account in order to have access to student data to keep them informed about academics, 
attendance and biographical information.  ThinkCentral, an on-line component of our literacy and math programs is accessible 
to parents and children. Therefore, workshops are scheduled to assist parents on how to navigate this useful resource. Parents 
are invited to Curriculum Conferences and grade-specific workshops to obtain information about curricula, including CCLS and 
Instructional Shifts.   As a school community, we firmly believe that when schools and families work together to support 
learning, parental involvement can have great impact on the performance and achievement of students. The P.S. 127 staff 
collaborates to help create an enriching and supportive environment for students and families with dedication to help meet 
the individual needs of our diverse population of students.   Parents of our newly enrolled ELLs are invited to the mandated 
ENL Parent Orientation meeting where they are informed of the three program models available in NYC. The over-the-phone 
Translation and Interpretation services, as well as, staff members with common home language are utilized when needed to 
translate imperative information to parents. In addition, all letters and forms regarding ELLs distributed to parents: Parent 
Surveys and Program Selection forms, Parent Brochures, Entitlement/non-entitlement letters, as well as, updated  Orientation 
videos are presented in their home language.

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our school annually runs the Report of Student Ethnic Census (RSEC) ethnic survey which reflects the percentage 
of each ethnicity within all of our classrooms. Upon initial registration, all parents enrolling their children in our 
school must complete a Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) to determine their child's dominant 
language.The revised HLIS now includes a section to help determine parental language preference when receiving 
written or oral communication from our school. Additionally, we review several ATS reports such as the Home 
Language Aggregation Report and Place of Birth Report to accurately determine our parents' interpretation needs. 
School Emergency Contact Cards also provide our school with parents' preferred language. The Contact cards are 
distributed in various languages. Emergency cards are kept in a central location in the Main Office, with the school 
nurse, and in the Guidance Counselor's office.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          93 

 

To ensure that all our parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can 
understand, our school website provides imperative information including upcoming school events, varied 
academic programs and projects, and details regarding State testing administration and dates that are instantly 
translated into all major languages. Our school website is updated by our parent coordinator daily. Also, our 
website gives parents access to class web pages that provide parents with classroom assignments, upcoming 
events, assemblies and trips. Class web pages are also instantly translated into all our major language groups. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

P.S.127 posts notices regarding the availability of translation and interpretation services at the main entrance of our 
school. Upon enrollment, in compliance with Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 regarding parental 
notification requirements for translation and interpretation services, parents are provided with the Bill of Parent 
Rights and Responsibilities, which highlights their rights to receive such services and how to obtain them. The 2017-
2016 School Safety Plan will identify procedures to ensure that language barriers will not interfere with limited or 
non-English speaking parents contacting the school's administrative office in case of an emergency. In the event that a 
parent or visitor does not speak English, the School Safety Agent or other staff member will attempt to locate a 
translator within the building by contacting the main office. If a translator is not present within the building, the 
School Safety Agent or other staff member will escort the individual to the main office, where a school representative 
will contact the DOE's Translation and Interpretation Services Unit to request telephone translation. Parents will also 
be informed of the availability of the Department of Education's website for further information. All notification 
documents are found at the Translation and Interpretation Unit's Intranet site: 
http://intranet.nycboe.net/SchoolSupport/translation_and_interpretation_unit.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

 

Parents utilize many ways to participate in providing feedback on their child's education. During the ESL Parent 
Orientation meeting in September, Parent Surveys and Program selection forms are completed. Parents are given the 
opportunity to view the Parent Orientation Video and discuss the various ELL program options, as well as, make them 
aware of the importance of the completion of The Parent Survey and Program Selection Form. In addition to the initial 
orientation meetings, parents attend parent-teacher conferences and quarterly progress meetings. Our teachers, 
including the ENL teachers meet with parents to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development 
process, their child's English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content 
areas. As per our UFT Memorandum Agreement, a forty minute block of time on Tuesday afternoons is dedicated to 
Parent Engagement meetings, workshops, and events. Parent meetings are conducted with a qualified 
interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands. Parents 
can contact our Parent Coordinator whose goal is to provide on-going support and resources to parents, help address 
parent concerns, and encourage parental involvement in the school. Our School Leadership Team is partially 
comprised of parent members is responsible for designing the school’s Comprehensive Education Plan (CEP) which 
governs key policies including the school's curriculum, extra-curricular activities, parental involvement, support 
services for subgroups including our English Language Learners as well as translation and interpretation services. Our 
Parent -Teacher Association (PTA) is comprised of parents and teachers. The PTA has access to the school's data which 
informs them of our strengths and our next steps. Members of the PTA are actively involved in school decisions 
regarding instruction, enrichment, support services, and school activities. With an open door policy and distribution of 
surveys, feedback is gathered on the quality and availability of services.
