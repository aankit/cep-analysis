Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The Bronx River High School’s mission is to ensure that our students are “college-ready” when they graduate. All 
decisions are made to ensure that we reach this goal. The mission of Advisory is to ensure that at least one adult in 
the school is getting to know each student well, making sure their learning needs are met, and encouraging them to 
make good academic choices and plan for their future with high expectations. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

To reach our goal, we are partnered with Blue Engine ( www.blueengine.org ). Blue Engine was founded by Nik 
Ehrman, a former TFA educator. Blue Engine gets recent college graduates from top universities around the country 
to commit to serve as a Blue Engine Teaching Assistant (BETA) in a high needs school. This school year, we will have 16 
BETAS in my school, four in every 9 th grade ELA and Algebra class, and three in every 10 th grade ELA class. This allows 
us to incorporate small group instruction on a daily basis in order to increase student engagement. Additionally, 
BETAS facilitate 2 hours of Extended Learning Time three days per week and lunch time ELT every day. My lead 
teachers meet with their BETAs three times per week: once for Progress to Goal monitoring for every student, and 
twice a week for planning high quality instruction. All Blue Engine high schools administer the same Quarterly 
Assessments throughout the year and the data is analyzed across all schools. Additionally, all ELA classes in 9th and 
10th grade are programmed in 90 minute blocks. In our ELA classes, student writing is graded using the 6-point CCLS-
aligned rubric across all grade levels. It is noted on the rubric that an average score of 5 is college-ready, level 4 is 
what we want to see by the end of 10 th grade, and level 3 by the end of 9 th grade. We have bulletin boards in our 
hallways that track our students progress towards college ready in writing using this rubric. In math classes, we 
facilitate Saturday Mock Regents tests in order to prepare our students for the Common Core math tests. Students 
understand that they must receive an 80 or above on the Regents in order to be considered college-ready and to 
progress to the next course. We also incorporate college trips into our curriculum as early as 9 th grade. For example, 
all 9 th graders visit local colleges, such as BCC and City College, and all 10 th graders visit college outside the city such 
as Marist College and SUNY Stonybrook. Lastly, all of our students are assigned an Advisory Teacher, with the 
expectation that students remain with their Advisory teacher for all four years. Advisory meets every day in 9 th grade 
and then flips with gym for the next three years. The mission of Advisory is to ensure that at least one adult in the 
school is getting to know each student well, making sure their learning needs are met, and encouraging them to make 
good academic choices and plan for their future with high expectations. Advisories are designed to foster stronger 
teacher-student relationships and a stronger sense of community and belonging in students.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our student population includes 25% students with disabilities and 20% English Language Learners. We offer ICT 
classes for both SpEds and ELLs as well as ESL classes for our beginner ELLs.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

This year, we have made the most progress in creating a safe and supportive environment in our school. Through our 
Advisory program, our counseling office, town hall meetings, and other areas we have developed an environment of 
support for our students.  

 

Key areas of focus this year, as identified in our Quality Review, will be on improving rigorous curriculum aligned to 
the Common Core Learning Standards and developing teacher pedagogy.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The Bronx River High School’s academic program supports and expects rigorous instruction across contents to ensure 
students are intellectually engaged and applying their critical thinking skills in all classroom. In order to ensure 
rigorous instruction, the Bronx River High School has set an instructional focus of literacy across the curriculum. Of 
our incoming freshman class of 117 students, 101 scored below grade level on the the NYS 8th grade ELA test. We 
believe that focusing on student's writing and reading will improve their achievement across content areas. 
Reinforcing literacy skills across all content areas allows students to produce evidence of what they know and allow 
for formative assessment on the part of the pedagogue. Our January 2017 data shows that the contents where 
literacy skills were continuously reinforced performed better on the NYS Regents. These classes include ELA, Global 
History, U.S. History, Living Environment and CC Algebra I. Classes where literacy skills were not reinforced as 
routinely did not perform as well on the NYS Regents. These classes include CC Geometry, Earth Science, Algebra 
Trigonometry and Chemistry. Based on our Advance Observations, the classes with the highest Regent Scores were 
classes in which Hochman Writing Strategies were used in the classroom. These writing strategies were essential tools 
in reinforcing quality writing as well as essential checks for understanding for the teacher. 

The Bronx River High School’s strength lies in its writing cycle. This cycle allows for students to use the Hochman Multi 
Paragraph Online, Quick Outline and Sentence Expansion to lay the foundation for starting the writing process. The 
writing cycle takes place in all ninth and tenth grade ELA classes. The writing cycle also contains one on one writing 
conferences for all students following their on-demand writing piece and allowing time for revisions. All students have 
shown significant growth from September 2016 to May 2017. 

The Bronx River High School’s needs are to ensure the implementation of Hochman across all contents. Since our 
opening in September 2013, we have encouraged teachers to implement Hochman; however, we were only able to 
provide limited professional development on its strategies. This past year, we were able to train one administrator 
and 14 pedagogues through a four day Hochman Writing Strategies professional development. This upcoming year, 
our goal and action plan will be to train an additional thirteen teachers and two additional administrators to ensure 
faithful implementation of Hochman Writing Strategies across curriculum.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

In order to ensure targeted writing strategies are evident in all classrooms, by June 2019, all Bronx River curricula will 
have been coherently aligned to the Writing Revolution scope and sequence, resulting in an increase of 2 points per 
grade level on our end-of-year diagnostic of student writing as compared to the 2017-2018 end-of-year diagnostic data.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The Bronx River High School will continue to be a High Impact 
Partner school with Hochman: The Writing Revolution. This 
partnership will provide coaching, off site PD, analysis of student 
work and measuring the growth of our students’ writing over the 
2018-2019 academic school year.  Thirteen teachers and two 
administrators will attend 4 full days of professional 
development, as well as 4 on-site coaching visits by Writing 
Revolution coaches. Additionally, BRHS will have an in house 
Hochman team made up of two Model Teachers. 

Monthly cycles of Hochman Writing Strategies aligned to our 
scope and sequence through our in house Monday PDs. The first 
week of the month will model how to use a specific strategy 
from our Hochman scope and sequence in the classroom. The 
following week, teachers will bring in their lesson plans that 
have incorporated the specific strategy that they will be using in 
instruction. The third week, teachers will bring in sample student 
work of the targeted strategy for peer review. These three 
sessions will all be held in Hochman work groups led by the two 
teachers on the BRHS Hochman team.

As described above, all students will take our Hochman baseline writing assessment in September, 3 interim writing 
diagnostics, and an end-of-year Hochman writing assessment, all graded using our Hocham Writing Rubric.  

We will use Advance Observations to see how successful the implementation of Hochman Writing Strategies is and 
what can be done to improve its implementation, if needed.  

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
A review of 2017-2018 suspension data shows we had 57 Principal's Suspensions and 8 Superintendent Suspensions. 
This is slightly down from 2016-2017. Although we have been very responsive to the needs of the students after 
incidents have occurred, and improved our preventive measures by implementing Peer Group Connections and 
formalizing mediations between students, we need to build upon these preventive measures by using restorative 
practices to improve our communication skills and strengthen our school wide community. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

As a result of our focus on Restorative Justice practices, by June 2019, there will be a decrease in suspensions to less 
than 50 Principal suspensions as compared to 57 Principal suspensions during the 2017-2018 this year.

curriculum. By September 6, 2018, all teachers and staff will 
attend an introductory professional development session for 
restorative practices and instructional methods for advisory. This 
professional development is designed utilizing the data gained 
from a survey of advisors and advisees in how to improve the 
advisory program. In addition, once per month PD sessions will 
train teachers on 4 additional circle activities from the Restore 
360 curriculum to be implemented in Advisory.

and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Bronx River High School’s academic program is one that encourages collaboration among teachers both within 
departments as well as cross curricular collaboration. We strive to increase peer visitations in order to share best 
practices to improve student outcomes. For teachers, one of the most effective ways to improve practice is to see 
how another teachers interacts with the same students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
In order to share best practices across the school around effective co-teaching strategies, by June 2019, all teachers will 
have had at least four scheduled inter-visitations with feedback sessions with our two Model Teachers, resulting an 
increase of at least 10% in the engagement of all students in co-taught classrooms compared to 2017-2018, as 
evidenced by data collected using our Student Engagement Note Catcher Tool during school-wide walkthroughs.

Bronx River High School just completed our second year in the AP for ALL initiative. Our campus goal is to increase the 
number of AP courses available to our students. This goal is needed since our College and Career Preparatory Course 
Index on the 2016-2017 High School Quality Guide was only 2.91, which did not meet target. This measure is not yet 
available for the 2017-2018 school year, and should be available in December 2018. Our priority is to increase the 
number of AP courses available on the campus so more students register for AP courses. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

and Time-bound. 
In order to increase the opportunity for students to have access to advanced courses, by June 2019, we will increase the 
number of AP courses offered by our school and our campus to 24 from the current offering of 16, resulting in an 
increase our College and Career Preparatory Course Index from a 2.91 in 2017-2018 to a minimum of 3.10

We will continue to fill vacancies by seeking highly-qualified teachers certified in the license area of the vacancy. We 
have a well-developed interview and demo-lesson process using a hiring committee comprised of administration, 
teachers, and other staff members. We recruit directly from TeachNYC as well as through highly-regarded teacher 
preparation programs such as Math for America, NYC Teaching Fellows, and Teach for America. Teachers are 
informed about our school model and mission, and must be willing to support the work we do in order to join the 
team. Once teachers are on board, we hope to increase teacher retention due to our establishment of a Professional 
Learning Community, where we establish a collegial and supportive environment. Teachers collaborate during 
common planning time, our annual retreat, and whole staff meetings. Teachers are given assignments based on their 
license, their talents, and their preferences. Teachers complete preference sheets every year and a schedule is based 
on the needs of the school and the students. A professional development plan is created that takes into account 
teacher preference, our school’s instructional focus, and key areas for improvement as identified through 
observations and feedback. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our Professional Development Plan includes the services of an educational consultant, the Hochman Writing program, 
and our participation in the DOE Learning Partners Program. In addition, teachers will attend professional develop 
given by the BFSC. For example, our Global History teachers will attend Global History: Teaching Historical Thinking, 
Writing, and Communication Skills

Teachers are given item-analysis templates to use to assess the level of achievement by students. After each quarterly 
exam, we facilitate department meetings to analyze the data and determine standards that need additional 
instruction.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Bronx River High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

The Bronx River High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Bronx River High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by 
Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

types of materials  

Begin description here:            
       Our Title III program will target ENL students who have not yet passed a Regents exam, or 
who have been identified as struggling to pass these exams. In order for ELLs to be academically 
successful and graduate high school, they must pass all of the required New York State Regents 
exams. ENL students need additional time with both the content, language development, and the 
reading and writing skills required to pass these exams. Complicating this is that while Spanish-
speaking students in New York City receive translated test editions and glossaries, the English 
Language Arts Regents is given only in English; furthermore, our school has a variety of 
minority languages for which supporting materials and translated tests are few or non-existent. 
Finally, many of our students are below grade level in their native language. 
 
     This program will serve students in grades 9, 10, 11, and 12. Students that are being served 
will have already taken and failed a required NYS Regents Exam. Because the indicator for these 
programs is having taken but not passed a required NYS Regent, students in this program will be 
from all subgroups of ENL students including newcomers, SIFE students and Long Term ELLs. 
The primary subject focus will be the most literacy-intensive content areas: the social 
science courses, U.S. History and Global History, and English Language Arts. There will be one 
class on Wednesdays focusing on English Language Arts literacy skills, one on Thursdays 
focusing on social studies writing skills, 
 
     There will be one teacher per class, either ENL or content certified, with an expected ten-
fifteen students per class. Students from multiple grades will be included in all sessions. The 
schedule for the Title III Regents academy will be Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40pm to 
4:10pm starting the first week of November with a kick off pizza party to invite the targeted 
students at the end of October.  These academies will be in English with customized native 
language supports. These academies will be run by the two ENL teachers, Justin Chapura and 
Jill Sobol, English teacher Concepción Alvarez, U.S. History teacher Valerie Dolan, and other 
invested content teachers. The sessions will be approximately 1.5 hours each, with a maximum 
of 30 sessions during the school year, adjusting for holidays and school functions. We plan to 
begin to the academy November 1st, ending on June 6th.  
 
        The materials used will be past additions of state Regents, content specific Regents review 
books, necessary English language support materials, and native language additional materials. 
Some of these supplemental materials are currently in use in the classroom, while other materials 
had been purchased in previous years. These materials will be updated or refined as needed. 
They are at no cost to Title III. As of 2018-19, all teachers have received training on The Writing 
Revolution, or "Hochman," literacy strategy. Instructional materials from this program are 
already available at the school and will be used throughout the program to improve English 
writing skills and content and academic language proficiency.  
        Attendance records will be kept by the teacher for each academy session. All attendance 
forms will be kept in a binder in the main office. They will be added to the binder at the close of 
each day allowing every student in attendance to sign in.

Begin description here:            
 In order to ensure the academic success of our ENL students in our Title III programs, our ENL 
teachers will lead at least three professional development sessions during regular 
Monday  meetings to prepare and inform content teachers on best practices for instruction during 
the day as well as updated ENL regulations as put forth in the New York State 
Commissioner's Regulations Part 154. The first session will happen within the first month of 
school to prepare teachers for maximum instructional impact for all subsets of ELLs, including 
incoming SIFE and long term ELL students. The subsequent sessions will continue building on 
instructional practice as well as familiarize staff with required procedures and instructional 
preparation for the annual state-mandated NYSESLAT proficiency test. 
 
 Additionally, our ENL teachers will attend BFSC and DELLSS professional development 
sessions throughout the year at no cost to the Title III program. In order to support all teachers, 
the ENL team will present a comprehensive best practices for ELLs strategies professional 
development to all content area teachers during the first month of the school year. Throughout 
the year, time will be carved out of the 80 minute Monday PDs to turn key additional 
pedagogical strategies in the content areas for ENL students by the ENL department and vested 
content teachers.  
 
The PD schedule is as follows: 
 
ELL Liaison Meeting 
Date: Monthly, TBD 
Topic: BFSC ELL Liaison Meeting 
Target Audience: ENL Coordinator/Teachers 
 
ELL Strategies in the Classroom 
Date: Yearly, TBD 
Topic: How can we support our ENL students in the classroom 
Target Audience: Content Teachers of ENL students 
Rationale: As a small school with a large ENL population, all teachers will have ENL students in 
their classes and should know strategies to support them. 
 
DELLSS PD- ELL Data Analysis Tool Training 
Date: Yearly, TBD 
Topic: Understanding how to use the ELL Data Analysis Tool 
Target Audience: ENL teachers and school administration 
Rationale: Understanding how to use this tool will allow us to better support our ENL students.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
     The Bronx River High School will host quarterly workshops for the parents of the students 
targeted in our Title III program, as well as all parents of our ENL students as required by city 
guidelines. These workshops will cover essential information for parents on their students' 
academic progress and strategies to help them be successful. We will invite parents in to ensure 
that they know the school is a resource for the family and a trusted source for relevant academic 
and graduation information.  
 
     In order to meet the needs of our parents, invitations will be sent out to all parents in their 
preferred languages according to the UPPG screen in ATS. If translation needs are required that 
the school is unable to support, we will reach out to the Language Translation and Interpretation 
Unit. These workshops will be held in September, December, March and May.  They will run 
from 5:00pm-6:30pm. These four workshops will cover: New York State Graduation 
Requirements and the NYS Regents exams; strategies for helping students study at home; 
understanding and preparing for the NYSESLAT; and accessing Community-Based 
Organizations and Translating Services for support outside of school. These workshops are at no 
cost to Title III. 
 
     These workshops will be facilitated by the ENL department, Kristen Fasolino, Justin 
Chapura, and Jill Sobol; and Meg Malloy, Assistant Principal. Parents will be notified through 
backpacking of letters translated into their indicated preferred communication language. When 
interpretation is not available in-house, the Language and Translation Unit will be used as a 
resource.  
        In order to to keep accurate records, we will have a Title III binder in which all attendance 
sheets, both of parents and students and agendas will be kept. We will keep a copy of the letter 
sent home to parents as well. This binder will be kept with all ENL binders in the main office.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
To guide instructional planning for ELLs, formative assessments are conducted at the beginning of the school year across 
contents. In the ELA classes, students take a baseline assessment using the Bronx River High School's six point rubric and 
decision tree rubric to assess student writing in accordance with our Blue Engine Partnership.  The results of the baseline 
assessment guide instruction using power stands from the rubric to address areas of improvement in writing. In the math 
class, a formative assessment is given in the beginning of the year to assess students' abilities. The results of this assessment 
also guide instruction to ensure targeted instruction of weaker areas among students.  Additionally, Bronx River High School 
has a high impact partnership with Hochman: The Writing Revolution. This partnership allows us to provide students with an 
additional diagnostic exam in ELA in the beginning of the school year and four quarterly writing diagnostics to assess literacy 
on a more granular level. The results of this diagnostic drive instruction to ensure students are receiving what they need. With 
these results, the ENL teachers work with the content area teachers to plan and design instruction to support ENL needs in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

classroom. In class formative assessments including checking for understanding through class discussion, exit tickets, 
questioning and discussion, information is gathered to guide instructional planning of our ELL students. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

This effort is supported through our partnership with Blue Engine. Blue Engine places BETAS (Blue Engine Teaching Assistants) 
in ELA and Algebra classes to support differentiated instruction and small group instruction. Our Hochman High Impact 
Partnership supports student writing using various formulaic writing strategies to develop quality writing. We have external 
coaches as well as an in house BRHS Hochman team to support teachers in lesson design and instruction to support ELLs. 
Scheduled co-teaching between ENL teachers and content area teachers allow for specific instructional strategies to be 
incorporated into daily lessons to meet the instructional needs for ELL students.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
In order to identify baseline, progress and improve scores on NYS Regents exams, NYSESLAT in addition to improving English 
acquisition in all four modalities,  Bronx River HIgh School uses the following: 
-On Demand Bi-Weekly Writing Cycles in the ELA classroom 
-Monthly Mock Algebra Regents for students in the spring of 9th grade 
-Hochman: The Writing Revolution: Beginning of year, Midyear and End of Year Writing Assessment 
-In class, teacher created summative assessments 
-Regents exams 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once summative data has been gathered, in order to address interventions, BRHS pedagogues use instructional grouping in 
the classroom, strategic co-teaching in the classroom including the alternate co-teaching model. Instruction is designed to 
explicitly address areas of need in the classroom while supporting the content area at the same time.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Outcomes from the yearly NYSESLAT exam are taken into account when programming students for their mandated services in 
the following year. Identified newcomer ELLs and students scoring at Emerging or below receive a unit of study in standalone 
English as a New Language. ELL students are further programmed for units of integrated English as a New Language in English 
Language Arts and/or other integrated content areas per Chancellor's Regulations Part 154-2. Monitoring of ELL students' 
Regents scores and grades in the content areas further dictate their course programming and/or the allotment of English as a 
New Language pedagogues where available.  
When programing ELL students we use the yearly NYSESLAT and NYS Regents scores.  We program all our Entering and 
Emerging students into stand alone ENL with a certified ENL teacher.  Those students along with our Transition students get 
programed in intergraded co-taught ELA class and one other core subject co-caught class.  Our Expanding and Commanding 
students are programed into any core co-taught class.  From NYS Regents data we will have an ENL teacher co-teach a review 
section where the demand is needed.  All co-taught classes for our ENL students have a trained pedagogue in English as a New 
Language. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In order to disseminate these findings to make adjustments to our programs, we have ENL department meetings with the AP 
of instruction to review data and make instructional decisions to meet the needs of our ELL students. Additionally, ENL 
teachers meet and work with content area teachers to ensure all pedagogues are informed on ELL data and students' 
academic results. The ENL team runs an EDAT report regularly to review attendance, credit accumulation and test scores of

ENL students to drive instruction. This tool is also used to identify crisis students that should be receiving more targeted 
intervention.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In our Freestanding ENL program, instruction is delivered to ELLs of all levels of English acquisition. This integrated 
model puts an ENL teacher and a content teacher into the classroom at the same time. This free standing ENL 
program integrates language and acquisition to ensure that all ENL students of each proficiency level are receiving the 
proper amount of mandated service minutes.  This integrated model allows for ENL students to be receiving their ENL 
support and acquisition while not missing any of the crucial content. Native language support, vocabulary and direct 
writing, speaking, listening and reading instruction are provided through this integrated model. All ENL students of all 
levels receive this integrated ENL support in their content classes. Additionally,  all students that are classified as 
entering or emerging in English language acquisition receive 45 minutes of daily instruction in a standalone ENL class. 
This class covers the instruction of grammar, language and content.  ELLs are grouped based on same grade level in 
order to ensure proper compliance with the mandated instructional mintues. Within these groups, there are 
heterogeneous proficiency levels.   Due to scheduling being based on grade level, each co-taught ENL class has varying 
levels of English proficiency.  Additionally, ELLs with IEPs are scheduled so they are receiving both ENL and Special 
Education services.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

           

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Mandatory instructional minutes are provided based on each proficiency level. In August, when NYSESLAT results are 
first published, each ENL student is given a schedule based on their level. This schedule ensures that students are receiving the 
minimum number of mandated instructional minutes each day. This is ensured by creating a schedule for the ESL teachers to 
co-teach content classes and ensure that ESL instruction and support occurs in core content classes.   Explicit instructional 
minutes are delivered differently throughout the day. Students that are entering or emerging in ENL receive 45 minutes a day 
of direct explicit ENL instruction in a stand alone class. During their ELA class, students receive instruction through both the 
content ELA teacher and ENL teacher in a co-taught environment.  For the five proficiency levels, students receive the 
following number of mandated instructional minutes each week: Entering students receive 540 mandated instructional 
minutes per week, Emerging students receive 360 mandated instructional minutes per week, Transitioning students receive 
180 mandated instructional minutes per week, Expanding students receive 180 mandated minutes per week and Commanding 
students receive 90 minutes of mandated instruction. Specific scheduling considerations are taken when programming the 
students for ENL services. Core academic content classes are prioritized. Literacy is seen across the curriculum therefore ENL 
services are provided in all core classes to ensure student growth, comprehension and success.          
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Core content is delivered in our Freestanding ENL program in English through sheltered English. Sheltered English allows our 
ENL students to receive both English and content instruction in the classroom.  Each classroom is supplied with textbooks, in 
English and the native language when available, bilingual dictionaries and word walls.  Native language supports are used 
throughout the classrooms including bilingual texts, bilingual word walls, intentional grouping of shared language students and 
teachers that speak fluently in more than one language. In the classroom, material is delivered through direct instruction and 
mini lessons which lead to group work and end in independent practice. The ENL teacher provides content area support in the 
classroom through the collaboration with the content teacher. This collaboration allows for the ENL teacher to know and 
deeply understand the content material. This structure allows students to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning 
Standards while fostering their language development at the same time.  These methods are in alignment with the Common 
Core Learning standards in that students are working with more rigorous non-fiction informational texts in the ELA classes. 
Students are able to understand the mathematical analysis and concepts behind the work and thinking more critically in the 
classroom. Groups are mixed heterogeneously for ENL levels of transitioning to commanding. ELLs that are entering or 
emerging work together in a group in order to receive additional language support from the ENL teacher.      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Due to the nature of our Freestanding ENL program, students are evaluated in English throughout the year with native 
language support. Native language support is given through the following resources: translated documents, native language 
Regents exams, native language independent reading books and bilingual teachers when available.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction is differentiated for the following ELL subgroups as explained below. 
a. For SIFE students, instruction is designed to focus on academic skills that may be missing due to the interruption in formal 
education. Supporting students in gaining these skills will allow students to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning 
Standards over time. For SIFE students, instruction is differentiated to meet them where their needs are and build from there 
to reach grade level academic work.  Within the Free-Standing ENL class, SIFE students receive more structured instruction 
with the teacher and less individual work time in the beginning to ensure that the skills necessary to complete the modified 
work are present. Additionally, SIFE students are referred for Extended Learning Time during lunch and afterschool to 
supplement the daily instruction inside the classroom. Academic weaknesses are identified in SIFE students and a plan of 
action to provide the student with necessary instruction is created.  
b. Instruction is differentiated for Newcomer ENLs by using significant native language support to ensure that while they are 
acquiring the English language in the classroom they are also comprehending the content material.  Supplemental texts and 
bilingual word walls are provided for students to use as support.  Newcomer ENL students receive a daily period of standalone 
ENL with the ENL teacher. Newcomer ENL students use native language supports to complete assignments as well. Spanish 
speaking students complete work in Spanish in order to assess comprehension of content not just language 
comprehension.  This creates a comfortable environment to focus on language acquisition while in an environment where 
students feel safe taking academic risks. ENL students are encouraged to attend Extended Learning Time to ensure that they 
are understanding the content material as well as the language material.  
c. Instruction is differentiated for developing ENL students through continued native language supports as well as direct 
instruction in grammar and writing.  ENL students are provided with additional vocabulary and a bilingual word wall to ensure 
comprehension of key vocabulary relevant to the content. While there is less native language support than with Newcomer 
ENLs, in order to foster further language development, Developing ENLs are still provided with instruction differentiated 
enough for them to be academically successful in the classroom. ENL students are encouraged to attend Extended Learning 
Time to ensure that they are understanding the content material as well as the language material.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

d. Instruction for Long Term ENL students is differentiated by placing a higher focus on writing of the English language as this 
seems to be the hardest modality for our students.  Long term ENLs have writing conferences and complete re-writes of their 
writing pieces to progress in English writing acquisition. Along with the writing modality, reading is also differentiated for long 
term ENLs as it is directly related to writing. Long term ENLs are encouraged to attend ELA Extended Learning Time to expand 
their writing ability. They receive one on one writing conferences and apply that feedback to their writing pieces.  
e. Former ELLs receive testing accomodations including a separate location, extended time, bilingual glossaries and translated 
editions of the assessments along with ninety minutes of ENL instruction in a free-standing ENL classroom with an ENL teacher 
and content area teacher.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers use direct instruction, group work and independent practice using grade level Common Core aligned subject material 
to provide access to the academic content and accelerate English language development.  The materials used include graphic 
organizers, Hochman Writing Strategy single paragraph outlines, multi paragraph outlines, conjuctions and stem sentences, 
scaffolded and bilingual texts in both textbooks as well as fiction books, interactive notebooks and teacher made work 
packets.  Materials are tailored to be both high interest and grade appropriate yet scaffolded and modified to meet the various 
levels and needs of our learners. The materials that we use are matched to students using data we are collecting from baseline 
assessments as well as student work to accurately assess the level of the student.  The instructional strategies for ELL-SWDs 
includes multi-collaboration through the content teacher, the Special Education teacher and the ENL teacher.  These students 
have bilingual dictionaries, word walls, vocabulary builders, graphic organizers, sentence prompts including the Hochman 
strategy of because, but, so. Teachers collaborate together to design scaffolds and differentiated material to meet the needs of 
the learner without trimming any of the necessary content in alignment with their IEP goals.  The school ensures that ELL-
SWDs receive all services mandated on their IEPs through a team meeting consisting of Julian McDonough, Special Education 
Coordinator, Bessi Fernandez, Social Worker, Justine Astacio, guidance counselor and Justin Chapura and Jill Sobol, ENL 
teachers. Together this team ensures that ELL-SWDs are receiving all mandated services designated by their IEPs.  All ELL-SWDs 
whose IEP mandates ESL instruction receive appropriate program through a review of NYSESLAT levels and services dictated by 
the student's IEP. A program is designed for the student that ensures the student is receiving both the mandated number of 
ESL instructional minutes as well as the recommended Special Education program, related services and testing 
accommodations. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Bronx River uses flexibility within scheduling to ensure that ELL-SWDs are being provided support services from both the ENL 
teacher as well as the co-teaching Special Education teacher. Classes are co-taught to maintain the least restrictive 
environment.  Within core content classes, ELL-SWDs are receiving both their Special Education services through an ICT Special 
Education teacher and their ESL instructional minutes through a push-in ESL teacher. This programming allows students to 
participate in the general education curriculum and not miss any crucial content material necessary for passing the New York 
State Regents exams.  Students are scheduled to ensure they are receiving all their entitled services to be academically 
successful. Curricular flexibility is used to ensure that the curriculum and material are modified and supportive to the needs of 
ELL-SWDs.  Instructional flexibility is used within the classroom and through the collaboration of the teachers. Instructional 
models of integrated co-teaching are used throughout the day to ensure academic success of all students.  In order to place 
ELL-SWDs in the least restrictive environment, integrated co-teaching is always the goal.  At Bronx River High School, we have a 
partnership with Blue Engine. Blue Engine is an educational start up that trains recent college graduates through an intensive 
summer training program to be teaching assistants in math and ELA classrooms in the 9  th   and 10  th   grade. Due to the 
nature of this partnership, the student to staff ratio in our 9  th   and 10  th   math and ELA classrooms is 5 staff to 28 students 
on average. In the classrooms of ELL-SWDs, the ratio of staff to student is even higher.  This programming allows our students 
to be in the least restrictive environment.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

The targeted intervention programs offered at Bronx River High School are Blue Engine,  ELT, our weekly writing cycle and 
stand alone ESL class for entering and emerging students. Our Blue Engine partnership is one that places three teaching 
assistants in every math and ELA class. This allows for small group instruction, increased modification and differentiation to 
work and lessons and allows for students to receive additional one on one instruction from adults.  This partnership increases 
intervention for all students, including ELLs, to ensure that there is constant formative assessment and feedback being 
provided to students to ensure that learning is taking place.  At Bronx River, we offer ELT (extended learning time) this takes 
place after school as well as during lunch. During extended learning time, students are both targeted for intervention and 
asked to participated as well as students choose to come for extra help on a learning target they are struggling with. ELLs are 
encouraged and invited to attend. ELT is done in both English and Spanish by bilingual staff members. The weekly writing cycle 
has ELLs, as well as all students, writing, conferencing and rewriting every week. The cycle starts with an on-demand writing 
prompt followed by a writing conference with either the teacher or teaching assistant providing each student with specific and 
meaningful feedback on their writing. After the writing conference, students then produce a rewrite of their original piece 
taking into account the feedback they received.  The growth in student writing is monitored and measured over the course of 
the year. For all entering and emerging ELLs, they receive one period a day of Stand Alone ESL. This class provides them with 
the content, grammar and vocabulary necessary for them to be successful in other classes. Targeted intervention for math are 
included in the Extended Learning Time. Learning targets for each student are identified and monitored to assess that students 
are meeting the learning targets. When a student receives less than 80% on a specified learning target, that student is referred 
to Extended Learning Time for re-instruction of the missed learning target. ELLs of all levels, regardless of proficiency, are 
referred to ELT when necessary. Targeted interventions for both Science and Social Studies are done in the classroom as well 
as after school and during lunch. When students are identified for targeted intervention, they are referred for additional 
learning time and tutoring. During the class time and the lunch this is done by the content teachers After school additional 
learning time and tutoring is provided by the ESL teachers, Kristen Fasolino and Justin Chapura.  All ELLs that are identified as 
needing RTI in their academic studies are referred to the Extended Learning Time programs. ELLs that need more native 
language support receive instruction in their home language when available. In addition to these services, our TItle III Program 
meets after school with ENL students in order to offer additional support and preparation for the New York State Regents. Our 
data has shown that ENL students struggle to pass the Regents. We have designed our Title III tutoring program to offer 
additional support to the support students are receiving in their content classes. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
Based on our data, we have created an in house team of Hochman trained pedagogues to support pedagogues with 
implementation of Hochman writing strategies in the classroom. This will improve writing and content instruction as well as 
the academic writing abilities of ENL students.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have not had any bilingual programs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. After school and supplemental services offered range from all the 
building wide PSAL sports, signs and posters are displayed in more than one language, informing students of try-outs and 
practice times to extended learning time offered at BRHS as well as various clubs. These activities are promoted for all students 
and access is equal for all.  Additionally, the school offers Extended Learning Time after school and during lunch. Extended 
learning time supports students with homework and supplemental instruction. Students are referred for Extended Learning 
Time through an invitation and pass from the teacher and/or teaching assistants based on their scores on exams and 
assignments and success in reaching classroom learning targets. This year, the Bronx River High School is implementing an 
Afterschool Academy for all students with ENL students being supported through targeted intervention. This targeted 
intervention works to improve the Regents pass rate as well as credit accumulation. This program is designed to support ENL 
students, as well as others, and ensure academic success.  Other extracurricular activities include an afterschool STEM 
program, dance club, STEP club, National Honor Society, Student Council, International Club, Social Justice Cluband Debate 
Club. ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs through open registration. ELLs are granted the same access and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

information on the clubs. Announcements are made over the PA system, posters are hung and clubs pass through advisories 
letting all students know what available curricular and extracurricular activities are being offered throughout the school.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All classrooms use Promethean boards for instruction. Programs are on these Promethean boards are both audio and visual to 
support ELLs. Additionally, all classrooms have supplemental materials in students' native languages. There are word walls in 
each classroom.  Our school has one computer lab and five computer carts that are used to blend instruction in the classroom. 
ELL students are given access to laptop computers in the classroom to help with language support and vocabulary 
development. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered through supplemental texts and materials in the students' home language. Additionally, 
home language is supported by the use of computers and other technology that allow students to complete their work in both 
English and their home language. Teachers and staff members that speak the student's home language will communicate with 
the student in their home language to ensure comprehension.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The Bronx River ensures that students' ages and grade levels are taken into account when choosing appropriate content 
material for the Free Standing ESL class. We ensure that the staff and the material are sensitive to students' ages and grade 
levels and not just reflective of the students' ELL status. We look to use high interest material that is age and grade appropriate 
for ELLs.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
In our co-located building, resources are shared through ENL programming when necessary. Additionally, NYSESLAT grading is 
done using ENL teachers from more than one school to ensure compliance with NYSESLAT grading rules. After school clubs and 
sports are open to all students. This allows students to build community with one another outside of our school but within the 
campus.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the beginning of the school year, Bronx River has a Summer Bridge freshmen orientation. This orientation helps to 
familiarize students with their teachers, peers and the school before the first day of school. Summer Bridge is faciliated by the 
Assistant Principal, teachers and the Parent Coordinator.  For students who enroll during the school year, their family is invited 
in to meet the teachers. Parents are asked to join the Bronx River Parent Association and become involved in the 
school.  Additionally, new ELLs are paired with another student to foster friendships and an understanding of the school.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

As a small school with limited scheduling, electives are not as varied as we would like to see. We currently offer only Spanish as 
a traditional class. However, we are working to expand our iLearn lab allowing students more choice in their programming. 
Expanding this lab would allow for more language electives.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development plan for all ELL personnel at Bronx River High School is to work in small professional learning 
communities of Hochman Work Groups. Within these groups, teachers work together to provide support and critical feedback 
to each other on their unit and lesson plan development, instructional strategies including scaffolding and differentiating and 
assessing student work based on Hochman Writing Strategies. This  professional development plan is comprehensive of best 
practices for ELLs including increasing literacy in co-teaching classes. These groups put those practices into action and then 
come back together to reflect and improve these practices. Additionally, during the professional development on the first day 
of school, all teachers are provided with a breakdown of ELLs and their levels and grades.  Included in this professional 
development is a collaborative discussion of best practices and expectations for teachers of ELLs. All teachers of ELLs receive 
specific professional development on incorporating native language support and appropriate differentiation for ELL students in 
the classroom. These professional development workshops are facilitated by the ESL teachers, Kristen Fasolino, Jill Sobol and 
Justin Chapura, at Bronx River High School.  This professional development will take place during the month of January, 2018. 
Additionally, all teachers receive Hochman Writing Strategy professional development.  The Hochman Writing Strategy 
supports writers by starting with sentence instruction before moving on to paragraphs and essays. It provides the basic 
foundation for writing which is a strong support for ESL students.  Hochman PD is faciliated over the course of the year. 
Fourteen teachers will attend outside Hochman PD through our High Impact Partnership. All teachers will work over the course 
of the year on the implementation and review of Hochman and its effects on ELL students' writing ability.  All professional 
development includes direct instruction followed by professional learning communities of pedagogical groups that work to 
reflect and assess on the implementation of PD material as well as an assessment of student work.  PD happens every Monday 
after school for 80 minutes in four week cycles.    
Additionally, ENL teachers will attend ENL specific PD faciliated through the Department of English Language Learners and the 
Borough Field Support Center over the course of the year. This material will then be turn keyed to all staff from the ENL 
teachers.  
As we shift to Common Core Learning Standards, it is essential that teachers of ELLs are provided with professional 
development in supporting ELLs through the shift. At Bronx River, the ESL department facilitates a professional development 
on best practices and strategies for instruction of ELLs. They provide this professional development to the whole school.  This 
PD provides specific and meaningful strategies for supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. 
Additionally, teachers of ELLs will be sent to professional developments offered by the Division of English Language 
Learners.  They will attend PDs focused on supporting ENL students through the instructional shifts required by the Common 
Core Learning Standards. These professional developments will support teachers in their understanding of the Common Core 
Learning Standards as well as support the teachers in their ENL tailored instruction. Through the resources provided to the 
teachers of ELLs, teachers will be able to increase the engagement of ENL students in the content and classroom material.  The 
PD will support teachers in ensuring that ENL students are able to meet the academic demands of the Common Core Learning 
Standards.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff is provided with professional development and in classroom support to help ELLs transition from middle school to high 
school. ELLs are placed in advisories when entering the ninth grade. In this advisory classes, students learn what is required of 
high school students including the accumulation of 44 credits in specified content areas as well as passing a minimum of five 
New York State Regents exams.  Additionally, ELLs and their parents are invited to a "Pathways to Graduation" Night at the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

school in which all high school requirements and the difference of expectations between middle school and high school are 
thoroughly covered. This workshop is facilitated in both English and Spanish.  Support from the guidance counselor is offered 
through academic counseling and attendance monitoring. ENL students with poor attendance receive phone calls, letters and a 
home visit when necessary. Attendance is a significant indicator in academic success and The Bronx River ensures that ENL 
students are supported in the transition and understand the importance of regular attendance.  The guidance counselor, 
Justine Astacio, spearheads the attendance team and the attendance intervention procedures.   
In order to ensure our school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2, we focus professional 
development on instruction and academic success. We ensure that specific in house PD's are focused on ELLs and their success 
in the classroom. We ask our ESL Department to faciliate whole school PD to ensure that all teachers know the best practices 
for instruction of ELLs. Additionally, we send our ESL Department to PDs outside of our own school. They attend professional 
development workshops focusing on ELLs and writing, ELLs and Math and stay abreast in all the PDs on the changes to ESL 
Regulations including the NYSESLAT and NYSISTELL. This year our Professional Developments are focused on the 
Hochman Writing Strategies and their implementation across all contents to increase literacy. Through this training, there is a 
focus on ENL students and their literacy specific needs. This PD covers how to use these strategies to scaffold and differentiate 
materials in the classroom to meet the needs of ENL students while pushing their learning forward.  Records for professional 
development are kept through attendance rosters as well as agendas.  When teachers attend PD outside of the school, they 
are asked to submit an agenda to the payroll secretary as well as keep one for their own records.   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
This year, the Bronx River High School will use it's weekly parental engagement time to invite parents into the school to meet 
with all the teachers of their child. When parents of an ENL student come to the school, they are able to meet with the team 
(administration, social worker/guidance counselor, content area teacher and ENL teacher) to discuss the language needs and 
goals of the individual student and the steps that the school is taking to meet both these needs and goals.  These meetings are 
arranged by the parent coordinator and facilitated by the staff to discuss academic and language progress for the child. For 
Spanish and Arabic speaking parents, the meetings are facilitated by staff members that speak Spanish and Arabic fluently and 
know the student well. For meetings that cannot be conducted in Spanish or English, the school will use the Language Line to 
ensure that all attendees of the meeting can successfully communicate and understand the content being discussed. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We have one ELL parent who participates in the SLT and Bronx River Parent Association.  However, we do have a Student 
Achievement Dinner each year to recognize the success of our students. Many of these students are ELLs and we have parental 
involvement in supporting our students this night. At the end of the year, we have a family barbeque in which we ask parents 
to help volunteer if possible, we have had ELL parental involvement through volunteering. We are working to increase our ELL 
parental involvement this school year.  We will invite ELL parents into the school for an evening workshop focusing on New 
York State graduation requirements. This workshop includes the four year benchmarks for monitoring progress to graduation 
on a yearly basis.  Our Spanish-English bilingual coordinator hosts workshops for parents as well as runs the Parent Association 
at the Bronx River High School. She reaches out to parents via mailings and phone calls to ensure that all parents are made 
aware of activities in the school. If the native language of a parent is that other than Spanish, a translator is requested throug 
the Translation and Interpretation Unit. If they are unable to fulfill the request, the Parent Coordinator, Gisela Marrero, will 
look to other organizations that are able to provide translation.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Gregory Fucheck, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Bronx River uses various methodologies to assess language preferences of the parent community for both 
written and oral communication. These various methodologies include using the data collected from the Home 
Language Survey for newcomer students to the New York City school community. We also collect language 
preferences through ATS reports that show the home language for students who are not new to the New York 
City school system. We collect an emergency blue card for each student at the beginning of each year. This 
emergency blue card asks the parents to identify their preferred language for both oral and written 
communication. We take note of the languages gathered through these blue cards. Additionally, during The Bronx 
River High School's 'Meet the Teachers" night and Parent Teacher conferences, we conduct parent surveys asking 
parents to identify their preferred language of communication as well as activities and topics of interest for parent 
workshops. Bronx River High School displays welcome signs in the main lobby and main office in various languages 
allowing parents to identify their preferred language.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In case of emergency, our school will reach parents that prefer a language other than English using the preferred 
language according to ATS and the emergency blue cards. When available, a bilingual staff in the parent's preferred 
language will contact and communicate with the parent about the situation. When there is no bilingual staff member 
of that preferred language, the school will use the Language Line to contact the parent and ensure that the parent is 
fully informed of the emergency situation. Additionally, the school uses Kinvolved to text parents. Kinvolved has 
language options that can be assigned to parents. The office staff update Kinvolved every year with the parent's 
preferred language according to ATS to ensure parents are receiving messages in their preferred languages. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The Bronx River High school will fulfill parental notification requirements of translation and interpretation services for 
all parents by informing all staff of the preferred language for both written and oral communication of each parent. 
Staff will be trained on how to access for effective communication with parents with preferred languages other than 
English. We will also sure that we are utilizing the services provided by the Translation & Interpretation Unit, our own 
in-house staff members for interpretation and translation services, The Language Line whenever necessary, as well as 
contacting outside vendors when necessary. Ensuring involvement and engagement of parents is a priority at Bronx 
River High School and we will utilize all resources to ensure that we are creating an engaging and welcoming 
environment for parents.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Bronx River High School will ensure parents that prefer a language other than English aware of their right to receive 
information using the resources provided to the Language Access Coordinator on Language Access. Welcome and 'We 
Speak your language' posters in various languages will be clearly displayed in the main office and upon entering the 
school building. All offices will have the language identification cards for parents to identify their preferred language. 
Signage posted in the school will be in languages other than English in addition to the translated versions of The 
Parents' Bill of Rights. Mailings/brochures/fliers that are mailed home will be in the parents' preferred language using 
available resources through the New York City Department of Education as well as outside vendors when necessary. 
Parents are also notified of language assistance options through Kinvolved text messages in their preferred language.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to assess the quality and availability of translation and interpretation services provided by the school, The 
Bronx River High School will conduct an end of the year survey, in all preferred languages, to see how we are doing 
and how we can improve. This survey will address the quality and availability of language services provided by the 
school. Additionally, we gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the language services 
they received through 'Meet the Teacher" night, Parent Teacher conferences, meetings at the school, Parent Teacher 
Association meetings and parent workshops that are held by the parent coordinator, Gisela Marrero. Invitations for all 
of these meetings will be sent in the parents preferred language to ensure accessibility. Translators will be made 
available when necessary. For languages spoken and/or written by school staff, staff will be used for translation. For 
other languages, outside translators will be brought in to the school. Along with students' final report cards, a 
language survey for parents will be sent home to all parents of limited English proficiency at the end of June. This 
survey will be collected by our Parent Coordinator, Gisela Marrero.
