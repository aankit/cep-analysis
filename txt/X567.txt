Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Vision:  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our families are the roots that allow our Linden Tree to grow and flourish. We celebrate the diversity of our children’s 
culture, language and experience and value the opportunity to learn from one another. Our school community will 
appreciate, nurture respect each other. We will provide children with the tools to resolve conflict with respect and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

empathy. We strive to help all of our students develop strong values, be reflective, and develop a strong sense of self 
as they negotiate the world.  

At Linden Tree Elementary we foster a culture of learning for all members of our school community. We believe that 
all students can achieve academically and that teachers are equipped to support this learning by incorporating an 
integrated curricula, relevant project based learning and first hand experiences that foster lifelong learners. We 
believe that through an environment that provides individualized support, students will learn the value of, and 
techniques necessary to build a growth mindset. This mindset will allow our school community to understand and 
realize that effort, persistence and relevant experiences are the key to becoming global leaders of innovation and 
discovery. 

Our Mission Statement:  

Through collaboration, all community members of Linden Tree foster a growth mindset that ensures academic 
achievement for all students through integrated curricula, project based learning and first hand experiences.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

In the fall of 2017 Linden Tree Elementary was designated as a magnet school adopting the STEM focus. Our school 
name was changed to Linden Tree Elementary Magnet School for Global Leaders of Innovation and Discovery. Our 
students are ethnically diverse with 15% Black, 63% Hispanic, 17% Asian and 5% from other backgrounds. In the 2017-
2018 school year 28% of our students were English Language Learners, 21% are students with disabilities and 76% are 
from low socioeconomic households. As articulated in our mission, we at Linden Tree celebrate this diversity and seek 
to teach our students to appreciate and nurture each others differences.  

 

Our classes will be content specific in grades 3-5 to further support the implementation of our integrated curricula 
that is at the heart of our magnet focus. The upper grades will continue to have targeted grouping of students based 
on ability and our teachers will continue to focus their instruction in one of the following areas: Math, Science/PBL 
(STEM), Literacy/Social Studies. We believe that these content specific classes and learning opportunities are vital for 
students to develop an even deeper understanding of the content being taught as well as their role as learners. The 
content-specific class structure will provide teachers ample time to improve their instructional practice by focusing on 
one subject area that will include the research based best practices necessary to improve the learning outcomes for 
all students. These content specific classes will also provide teachers the opportunity to plan vertically across grades 
and engage in frequent cycles of inquiry in grade teams as well as vertical-content specific teams. This cohesiveness 
will ensure that instruction is data driven and grounded in research-based best practices which will expose all 
students to critical thinking learning opportunities as well as allowing teams to be responsive to individual student 
needs. To support teachers with these content specific classes we will have two Literacy Curriculum and Instruction 
Specialists and one Math/Science Coach working with teams to plan integrated units that include multiple entry 
points for our various levels of learners. In addition, these instructional leads will provide RTI support to Tier two 
students in their respective grade bands. In grades K-2 teachers will teach all subjects and students will 
homogeneously grouped for reading and math only.  

In order to create trans-disciplinary units of study as required by our Magnet designation, Linden Tree will be 
adopting the Expeditionary Learning (EL) 2018 Content Based Literacy Curriculum across all grades. The EL curriculum 
will allow teachers to support all students in mastering rigorous content, develop positive character and produce high 
quality work while addressing real world problems and pursuing hands on solutions. The interdisciplinary project-
based curricular structure of EL provides learning expeditions designed to engage students and encourage them to be 
the leaders of their own learning. The EL Education curriculum is focused on equity and the belief that all children 
deserve schools that foster their unique abilities, give them a real opportunity to achieve high academic standards 
and help them take their place in a society for which they are well prepared. We have also adopted the Amplify 
science curriculum and the Engineering is Elementary (EiE) to promote contextual learning and problem solving skills 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

in science. We strive to blend EL Education, Amplify and EiE to create transdisciplinary units that incorporate Project 
Based Learning components that will push students to become active problem solvers.  

We have collaborations with organizations as a means of ensuring students are provided opportunities to local 
community and greater NYC learning experiences that will deepen their understanding of the world around them. 
Through our partnerships with Brain Power, Education Through Music, Power My Learning, Cool Culture, the Arts 
Continuum, Magic Box, Salvadori and NY Historical Society, our students will learn first-hand about the various 
content areas they are studying. Through our partnership with The Greenwich Village Society for Historic 
Preservation; our 2nd graders have had the opportunity to learn about the history of Greenwich Village through field 
trips and in class instruction by a GVSHP educator.  

 

Our strengths include our individual focus for all children as evidenced by the significant growth that our students 
achieved in reading this year. 92% of our students made at least two levels of progress during the 2017-2018 school 
year, as evidenced by increases in their Fountas & Pinnell reading levels. These gains are the foundation for our 
continued focus on formative assessment to inform rigorous instruction in Literacy content areas. In addition, the 
successful implementation of the Linden Leaves PBIS program helped to maintain a positive school culture, grounded 
in a growth mindset.  

 

We know our children on all levels (academically, emotionally and socially) and provide support systems that enable 
each child to thrive. We see all constituents of Linden Tree, (staff, parents, and children) as a Linden Tree family 
member. Parents are very active and have complete access to all Linden Tree members. We plan monthly community 
events to build relationships and spend time communicating and bonding as a family. 

 

The staff at Linden Tree values collaboration. Last year we implemented the Professional Learning Community 
framework and both vertical and grade specific teams met to analyze student work and, through the inquiry cycle, 
implement research based solutions to gaps identified in student learning.We have developed formalized protocols 
for PLCs and created protected time for collaborative teams to meet. Our school-wide instructional focus on 
Assessment, both formative and summative, will go hand in hand with our commitment to the PLC process and the 
need to build teacher capacity as well as ensure student progress towards CCLS. Furthermore, ongoing professional 
development will be tailored to meet the needs of our teachers based on feedback from our Instructional Coaches 
and Advance observations. Advance observation cycles will provide timely and actionable feedback aimed at 
promoting teacher reflection and follow up on next steps.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We had 115 ENL students in the 2017-2018 school year (28.3%) and 125 ENL students this year. We have two ENL 
teachers who use both the push-in and pull-out model to service the different needs of these students. We have also 
infused language goals within each curricular area to ensure students who are learning English as a new language are 
fully immersed in consistent academic and tier 2 language. We had 86 IEP students (21.1%) in the 2017-2018 school 
year. On every grade level there is a Special Education teacher assigned to provide differentiation and alternate 
learning styles and supports for children who learn differently. We have an IEP coordinator who will oversee all 
Special Education licensed teachers in order to provide consistency and professional development for each support 
teacher on each grade level.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school wide focus will continue to be the use of Formative Assessment to drive instruction in all content areas. 
Building on the foundation established in our PLCs, we will further develop the instructional inquiry cycle for grade 
level as well as content area collaborative teams. Our newly adopted EL curriculum provides teachers with common 
assessments and rubrics to evaluate student learning across grades and subject areas in order to respond to gaps in 
students learning and to facilitate student self evaluation. Furthermore, EL provides teachers with a framework for 
implementing a socio-constructivist paradigm where all learning is socially mediated through language that relies on 
classroom conversations about challenging texts. Our goal this year will be to incorporate language based solutions 
that will ensure we are addressing identified language based deficits and narrowing the language gap for all students. 
We plan to address this need by strengthening teachers' and students' dialogic inquiry skills as well as through explicit 
vocabulary instruction aimed at reading, writing and discussion techniques that develop student and teacher use of 
Tier II vocabulary. 

We constantly reassess our practice to ensure that each time something is taught, structures are incorporated to 
enable a more rigorous and educationally sound result. This year we will have 2 Literacy and 1 Math Instructional 
Specialists that will be responsible for: 

  Conducting bi-monthly classroom walk-throughs with administration to ensure teachers are being provided 

with frequent and actionable feedback.  

  Engage in monthly observation calibration sessions with administration to build capacity in using the 

Danielson Framework for teaching to observe teacher practice.  

  Engage teachers in a ‘curriculum audit’ at the end of each unit. (This includes reflecting and revising 

curriculum map at the end of each unit, analyzing student data at the end of unit and using this to inform 
future instruction).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
At Linden Tree we believe strongly in designing enriching curricula that meets the differentiated needs of all of our 
students. In grades 3-5 our classes are departmentalized for literacy and math to ensure that all students are receiving 
targeted instruction based on their learning abilities and needs. In grades K-2 students are homogeneously grouped 
for reading instruction in order to ensure that all students receive targeted instruction leading to meeting grade level 
standards. According to our school-wide end of year data: 45% of students (K-4) are reading on or above grade level 
and 92% of students increased their reading levels by at least 2 letter grades as measured by Teachers College 
assessments. Preliminary data from the June Subject Performance Report shows that 84% of students met 
promotional standards in ELA, while only 75% met promotional standards in math. This data indicates that there is a 
significant gap in our math instruction that must be addressed. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 85% of students including ELLs and SWD will improve at least 1 proficiency level as measured by the New 
York State Measure of Student Learning Math Task.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
We will conduct parent workshops and family engagement events that are aligned to our magnet theme, such as 
monthly family cooking around the world, quarterly STEM faires, and PBL unit celebrations. Additionally we have a 
"Cooking with math night" every year so that parents can learn math curriculum while working alongside their child. 
We will encourage and promote parent participation at these events by awarding "Linden Leaves" to parents who 
come and create a Linden Family Tree with the leaves. Class rosters will be used to mark parents' attendance and 
total percentage of parent participation will be measured for each class to guide parent outreach. Parent Coordinator 
will work the magnet team to carry out magnet events and coordinate workshops with grade leaders.  

The Family Homework Lab will provide online educational resources for families to use. Each Tuesday of the month 
will be assigned to a grade and staff by a teacher during Parent Engagement time to provide homework help and 
strengthen school to home learning connection.  

Have teachers select parents for parent volunteers to join the Parent Linc Program. 

Encourage parents to use the computer lab during school hours. (Resumes/spread sheets) And hold workshop for 
parents to teach them how to use various computer programs.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
At Linden Tree we foster a growth mindset for students and teachers alike. We make every effort to address all social 
and emotional needs in addition to exposing our students to a rigorous curriculum. After review of our in house 
Behavior Tracking Log, designed to track inappropriate behaviors, it was determined that for effective behavioral 
practices to take root, systems for emotional and social development need to be embedded within our daily 
curriculum. Therefore, all students will participate in Positive Behavioral Intervention Services (PBIS) daily lessons 
designed to affect positive social and emotional practices and behavior. As a result more students will receive Linden 
Leaves for exhibiting positive social and emotional behaviors and there will be a school-wide decrease in 
inappropriate behaviors logged. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June, 2019 there will be a 50% increase, as compared to June 2018, in the number of Linden Leaves awarded to 
students demonstrating positive social and emotional practices and behaviors and a corresponding decrease in 
inappropriate behaviors that are logged onto the online Behavior Tracking Log.

N - Nurturing E - Encouragement 

D - Determination E - Effort 

E - Equity 

N - Nobility 

Teachers will select 2 students in the beginning of the month who 
exemplify the monthly PBIS trait that is highlighted. Those 
students will be our student leaders helping to focus all students 
around the “behavior trait of the month” This is a form of student 
congress that will rotate monthly. At the end of each month, 
children who exemplify that “behavior” receive awards by the 
student congress along with principal, teachers, and other school 
personnel. There are also Incentives such as extended recess, or 
garden time where students select a specific activity of their 
choice. 

 

We also created two initiatives: 

“Mean Free Zone” and “Caught being Kind” -- 

These initiatives help the students to focus on positive behavior. At 
any time, students, teachers, personnel, etc. could write a “ticket” 
for anyone who has done a kind act. These children, teachers, etc. 
, are “called out” and highlighted for their good deeds.

earn “Linden Leaves” for positive behavior. The color identifies the 
denomination (blue - every day good behavior such as “Caught 
Being Kind”) green - to identify students who exemplify a growth 
mindset - working hard, perseverance, wearing uniform daily, etc., 
purple for outstanding behaviors - helping a friend in need, 
prevention of bullying, and gold for academic excellence. These 
“leaves” are used as monetary values where children can use them 
to shop in our School Store (the store is manned by Year 2-Student 
Union leaders who will also understand the importance of being a 
community worker). We believe that helping children to 
understand how this token economy works will further help them 
to understand how earned income, responsibility, and currency 
work as they grow older.  

*Year 3- Student Union leaders become ambassadors for Linden 
Tree where they co-facilitate tours for visitors and co-facilitate 
Open House events for incoming families, etc. 

*Student Union leaders meet weekly with Student Life Team 
members to develop leadership, set and plan initiatives, and voice 
student concerns.

*Attendance initiatives engage students in our PBIS values of 
learning and determination via weekly incentive plan and monthly 
assemblies.  

*Student Life team members facilitate daily motivational small 
group activities for target attendance groups.

*The National Elementary Honor Society Chapter at Linden Tree 
exemplifies the core values of hard work in learning, individuality 
in self-determination, effort, scholarship, and beyond. The student 
chapter meets regularly and co-publishes a peer newsletter.

*Use of social media to connect with parents daily to inform them 
of student achievements regarding PBIS behaviors. *Teachers will 
use Class Dojo (or a similar point system) to track student behavior 
in the classroom allowing parents to receive up to the minute 
information about successes, struggles, and sharing moments with 
parents in the form of videos and pictures. Also, teachers use Class 
Dojo point system (or a similar point system) to give students 
positive feedback for any skill, such as "working hard" and "being 
respectful". Teachers use this point system to provide the 
classroom with an incentive either daily, weekly, or monthly.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to ADVANCE observation data during the 2018-2019 school year, 42% of our teachers have received a 
“Developing or Ineffective” rating for component ‘3c’ engaging students in learning while 41% of our teachers have 
received a “Developing or Ineffective” rating for component ‘3d’ using assessment in instruction. This data indicates 
that there is a need for teachers to engage in structured and continuous professional learning communities that are 
aligned to our instructional focus and builds teacher capacity to improve their practice which will lead to improved 
student outcomes. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will participate in collaborative PLCs that will use the inquiry cycle to develop and implement 
formative assessment strategies to assess student learning as well as increase student engagement, This will lead to a 
40% increase in teachers receiving an Effective or Highly Effective Advance rating in Danielson component 3c ‘Engaging 
students in learning’ and component 3d, 'Using assessment in Instruction' based on data gathered during Advance 
observations conducted by administration.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the findings of this years two PPO reports, the leadership team at Linden Tree was successful in creating 
a culture of learning that communicates high expectations and fosters positive attitudes built on trust. In addition, 
administration was effective in using observation of classroom teaching and the analysis of learning outcomes to 
develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best.  

Our positive school culture is maintained through the continued incorporation of PBIS systems to ensure that 
students are nurtured and supported in all areas of development including academically, emotionally and socially. Our 
Student Life and our PBIS will raise the level of financial literacy and college and career capable by incorporating our 
new "Linden Leaves" program. This will ensure that children understand the value behind working at their greatest 
potential. In addition, we believe in a Restorative Justice approach to discipline so that students not only understand 
when they make a poor choice, but also how to give back to the community in which they are a part. 

Our ongoing professional development for teachers has a STEM focus this year providing professional development 
for teachers to fully understand how to integrate Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. By informing 
the teachers and including project-based stem assignments, we believe the children will become more engaged and 
excited about learning. 

In response to our areas for Next Steps as outlined on the PPO report, we are focusing on strengthening Teacher 
Leadership capacity. We are building leadership by enabling and encouraging teachers to take on roles such as Peer 
Collaborative Teacher, "Curriculum Development Specialist", STEM Coach, Mentors, Data Engineer, Early Childhood 
Specialist, Child Life Coach (Dean) . In addition, we are adopting the Professional Learning Community framework to 
give teachers opportunities to lead professional development activities through the analysis of student learning. We 
also plan to provide the staff with opportunities to communicate in surveys three times a year so that they have a 
voice in any new initiatives or issues that may arise.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June, 2019, data collected through NYCDOE School Surveys completed by teachers will show that 85% teacher 
responses affirm that school leadership is instrumental in development of teacher leadership opportunities and the 
school-wide initiatives have supported the building of teacher leadership capacity.

Our school will engage families and promote parent leadership by inviting all parents to attend LINC NYC.  

Parent LINC Workshops provide support for the families of emerging readers. Wanting your child to succeed in school 
is almost universal; having the skills to attain that goal is not. Through meetings, short presentations and multi-
session workshops, LINC provides clear instruction and resource materials, including appropriate books to assist 
parents in developing home libraries and the habit of daily reading. All communication is provided in an accessible, 
multi-lingual format for parents who do not speak English or read fluently themselves. 

Teachers will select parents to attend VIP (Very Involved Parent Academy) – Trains parents to be peer advocates by 
planning and executing their own reading activities in their neighborhoods.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Linden Tree values the relationship between all constituents of the school. We believe that in order for all children to 
achieve maximum instructional, emotional and social development, the partnership between school staff and parents 
is critical. Each year there is has been at least 20% increase in parental participation, as indicated by attendance at our 
school wide celebrations, Family Fun Nights, parent teacher nights and other school curriculum events. This year we 
will focus our efforts in strengthening the home school connection by emphasizing and developing our community 
partnerships, Linden Learning Partners, Tuesday parent engagement time and parent teacher conferences to reach 
out to our parents with timely information and support in order to improve student achievement. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 50% increase in active partnership between parents and staff of Linden Tree as measured 
by parent attendance at Tuesday Parent Workshops and parent teacher conferences.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Recruitment for staff begins in January. Once postings are developed, potential staff members are interviewed by a 
hiring committee made up of administration, teachers, and parents who use a common rubric for evaluating each 
candidates appropriateness. 

Once hired, new staff engages in summer professional development by grade level as well as whole group focusing on 
curriculum, culture, and social emotional supports and systems. In addition, prior to the start of school, all staff attend 
a retreat where we revisit our mission and vision statements so that each voice is part of the fabric of the school. Here 
we also arrange time for team building and getting to know one another so that we can build a collaborative culture 
in which there is a camaraderie going into the school year.  

By September, all new staff members are assigned a mentor that they meet with on a weekly basis. This year we are 
part of the district New Teacher Mentor Program where two veteran teachers were selected to mentor all incoming 
new members. Mentors visit with new teachers both during and outside of class time to provide feedback on 
classroom environment, lesson planning, lesson execution, student engagement and learning, questioning and 
discussion, assessment, data collection and analysis, etc. In addition, teachers are assigned a weekly common 
planning period to meet as a grade level team. Administration is present for support during these meetings. When 
necessary, targeted inter-class visits are scheduled. Administrators provide immediate feedback to teachers on 
classroom observations so that they can reflect and make necessary changes according to the feedback they receive. 

To support and prepare our new teachers; we have established the Linden Tree New Teacher Institute where our new 
and second year teachers learn about the operational and instructional expectations at Linden Tree. This institute will 
be led by Administration and the curriculum and instruction specialists. Topics include: Instructional foci, Danielson 
framework, grade level meeting expectations, tour of facilities, PBIS program etc.  

 

To support the development and retention of highly effective teachers and instructional practices, ( teachers are 
provided with meaningful opportunities for leadership that are challenging, yet enriching; such as curriculum 
planning, new teacher mentoring, academic coaching, technology integration and professional development 
leadership. Collaboration is cultivated amongst teachers where teachers are part of professional learning 
communities. Time is given to collaborate, reflect, and develop plans to elevate their teaching practice. An effective

strategy implemented toward retaining teachers has been through soliciting teacher feedback and utilizing it in 
decision making on school wide initiatives.  

Teachers meet daily on an informal basis. Meeting topics include: curriculum development, training on specific 
curricular materials, school wide focus, pedagogical practice, student assessments, looking at evidence of student 
learning and using data analysis to inform instruction. In addition, all teachers will participate in a Professional 
Learning Community designed to engage teachers in the instructional inquiry cycle. This framework will allow for 
teacher collaboration around best practices that will address specific learning needs of students that have been 
identified through the careful analysis of student work using common assessments and normed rubrics. 

The professional development plan was created by our PD team. The plan focuses around our 2017-18 school wide 
instructional focus of: If students are cognitively engaged in learning activities and aware of how they are being 
assessed, and if parents are actively involved in supporting their children, then students will work at their capacity and 
continue to show improved outcomes. Teachers are provided both in-house and off-site opportunities to extend their 
learning and professional knowledge in this area of focus. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
During each planning meeting, the appropriate Common Core Standards are used for teachers to first plan the overall 
purpose (or essential question) of the unit as well as learning objectives and student assessments. Additionally, as a 
team, we study Common Core aligned performance tasks and exams to understand where we need to provide the 
instructional focus in order to ensure students will be able to meet the challenges presented to them in future grades 

Teachers attend outside workshops at Bank Street, network offerings throughout the year, and visit other schools for 
additional targeted support.  

Administration attends monthly network meetings in order to share best practices and support one another in all NYC 
initiatives. 

Paraprofessionals receive training on FBA and monitoring of behavior for the students they serve. This is overseen by 
the IEP coordinator and guidance counselors in order to ensure consistency and effective documentation. 
Additionally, they are part of our Monday professional development where we discuss academic topics such as 
exposing students to high level questioning, engaging in meaningful discussion and assessment criteria, since they 
assist teachers in classrooms and can also be engaged in the school wide initiatives for students to meet CCSS

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
We have multiple Open House presentations throughout the year for both our pre-k potential students and our 
Kindergarten students to help the transition from students attending other programs throughout the community. We 
provide parents with information and what to expect when children come to Linden Tree with verbal and written 
correspondence. For our Turning 5 children, we examine all IEP materials and provide outreach for the families so that 
we are well prepared and organized to identify all needs of our incoming students 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
In Pre-K we use the ESI-R assessment tool to determine students strengths and next steps. When children arrive in 
Kindergarten in September, we begin with Fountal & Pinnell, and TC assessments in order to determine their reading 
strengths and abilities. We also use assessments from Fundations, Sounds in Motion, Engage NY, common core 
aligned rubrics, etc. Teachers meet in September to identify student strengths and abilities from these assessments 
and determine focus for specific groups to meet student needs. Teachers also meet daily in order to continue 
addressing the progress of individual students within their small groups and to determine next steps or next areas of 
specific focus for groups 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Linden Tree, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[Linden Tree] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

 

types of materials  

Begin description here:            
11x567 had 118 students who took the NYSESLAT in 2018. Based on this data from the 
assessment, we identified that students across all of the grades would benefit from additional 
support outside of the mandated school day time. In order to identify the students who would 
receive this after school support, we first looked at proficiency levels, determined target 
modalities, and finally we reached out to the families to invite students. From there, we added on 
students as necessary to reach our target number of 45 students. We targeted third through fifth 
grade in order to provide students with extra support who were in, or soon to be in, testing 
grades.All of the students selected will benefit strongly from this language rich program. As such 
PS 567 will offer an after school program that will begin October 3rd and end March 28th. The 
total number of sessions will be 44. The program will be from 2:30 until 4:00. There will be 
three certified teachers; one is certified in ENL, and the other two in general education and 
special education. The school will use other funding sources to compliment the cost of the Title 
III program.None of the students being served are SIFE nor are they long term ELLs.The 
language of instruction will be solely English, with native language support such as bilingual 
dictionaries and glossaries as well as the implementation of the student body system. Students 
come from a variety of language backgrounds (Spanish, Urdu, Arabic, Vietnamese, Chinese, and 
Bengali). As this is an extension of our school's ENL program, we will be delivering instruction 
in English to meet the needs of all of the students.Student attendance is taken daily and entered 
into a Google document for record keeping. If a student has continuous poor attendance (three or 
more absences) we will reach out to the parent, with a translator if necessary, to identify what is 
causing this. Depending on this meeting we will remove this student and replace them with 
another or give one more chance for the student to boost his attendance in the program. We feel 
it is necessary to have such a serious attendance policy because attending the program is not 
mandated and we have a large population of ELLs, all of whom could benefit from the 
opportunity. All records pertaining to the Title III program will be kept in the school's Title III 
binder as well as kept electronically in the Title III Google Drive.Instruction will be 
differentiated in two ways. First, the students will be split into groups to reduce the size of the 
total group based on their grade level. Within these groups, the students will be split into small 
working groups by proficiency level so that instruction can be differentiated with that specific 
level in mind. This will allow the teacher to work with the students in areas that directly support 
their English language needs as well as their classroom work in the different content areas.The 
language of instruction for this program will be English, with native language support. Students 
will receive assistance with vocabulary and concept development based on their content areas 
and ELA curriculum. Teachers will also pinpoint specific English language vocabulary or 
concept needs and design mini lessons based on these concepts when necessary. Materials used 
will be student's class work, laptops and iPads, Imagine Learning, Brain Pop, Finish Line for 
ELLs, and scholastic news.    Many of these resources are at no cost to Title III, the school will 
supplement the difference.

Part C: Professional Development  
Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as 
other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.   

rationale 
teachers to receive training  

 
 
  schedule and duration 
 
  name of provider 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
 The professional development program for Title III Program teachers consists of bi-monthly 
team meetings. These meetings will allow teachers to have the opportunity to bring up students 
or student groups of concern. It will also allow them to brainstorm lessons with their colleagues 
and evaluate how the instruction is going. Teachers will use Imagine Learning data to track 
student progress and can use this time to evaluate data.When the ENL Coordinator attends out of 
building trainings or seminars, she will turn key that information to the other after school 
program teacher as well as other classroom teachers responsible for educating ELLs. The grade 
level PLC meetings will occur every other Wednesday during mutual prep time. This component 
is at no cost to the Title III program. There will be a total of approximately 40 sessions.There 
will be procedural note keeping for these meetings and the notes will be recoded in a 
google document. Additionally, the teacher team will share a google drive file in which to share 
information about the program most efficiently.Overall, the PD will positively impact the 
progress of ELLs because it is a structured process in which the teachers analyze and discuss the 
growth (or non-growth) of the students in the program. Through this open communication and 
sharing of ideas and resources, as is the norm for a PLC, the instruction that happens within the 
after school program will be strong and targeted.All teachers will also be grouped by grade band 
and recieve professional development related to ELLs during Monday PD time. Some PD topics 
will be an overview of the ELL levels, mandated testing, and the numbers and languages in our 
school, bilingual and translation resources, ways to use Imagine Learning in the classroom, what 
to do when you get a newcomer in your class, ways to scaffold for your ELLs, and an overview 
of NYSESLAT compared to the ELA. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.   

rationale 

 
  schedule and duration 
 
  name of provider 
  how parents will be notified of these activities 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
       Parents of ELLs are invited to attend monthly parent engagement seminars. These will occur 
on Tuesdays after school from approximately 2:30-3:15. The seminar topics will vary, and 
consist of topics such as; using Imagine Learning or other apps at home, reviewing summer work 
folders, reviewing newcomer folders, reviewing an ENL parent handbook, resources in our 
community, and homework help. Our school has decided that this will be an effective way to 
reach parents and provide them with the help they may be interested in. The providers of the 
seminar will be both ENL and classroom teachers, as the parents will be grouped by grade 
level.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Another way we engage parents is through our monthly family fun nights. All families are 
invited to these in advance at which the parents (and students) have an opportunity to participate 
in educational and fun activities. 
 
We are also hoping to begin a sort of Saturday Social. This would happen quarterly and parents 
would be invited in to share a meal together and then break out into workshops that focus on 
topics such as ELA, math, or ENL help. 
 
In general, parent workshop topics are chosen in a few ways. One way is through a selection 
form that goes home at the beginning of the year. This form gives parents the opportunity to 
identify one or more topics from which they think they could benefit from additional guidance 
in. (Examples of topics are; homework help, what do state tests look like, how to help my child 
learn to read, etc.)  Another way we identify the needs of parents is at the parent teacher 
conference nights. Based on the turn out, types of questions asked, etc. teachers work together in 
after school meetings to identify additional topics that may be beneficial for the parents. 
In order to ensure that parents of Title III students as well as parents of ELLs will participate in 
these activities, we use an App called "Remind". This program allows us to send messages out to 
groups of people in their language of choice. Research has shown that texting is the most 
efficient way of communicating with parents and ensuring that they see the message. 
Additionally, we constantly remind parents of upcoming events both verbally, and with signs and 
notices.  We also make a point to remind parents who out point people on staff are who speak 
additional languages to whom they could go to with questions or more information. We also use 
classroom Dojo and find it to be very effective in sharing messages with families. 
 
Again, in order to maintain records of these meetings there will be a google document 
established. This will contain information about meeting times, days, and topics, as well as the 
attendees.  
 
In order to keep track of which language parents need information delivered in, the ENL 
Coordinator maintains a document that contains this information grouped by grade. 
 
In order to communicate with parents, we have a few different methods. On our school staff we 
have people who speak Arabic and Spanish. In order to accommodate the additional languages, 
we use the over the phone translation program provided by the DOE. When sending forms home, 
we use online translation services. We also are beginning to make use of the "Remind" App, 
which texts or emails parents in their preferred languages any pertinent information from the 
school that we wish to send out. This will most likely be the most effective means of 
communication from the parents, according to research. 
 
 
In order to keep track of which language parents need information delivered in, the ENL 
Coordinator maintains a document that contains this information grouped by grade.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In order to meet the needs of our ELL learners, we begin with formal and informal assessments.  These include the NYSITELL, 
TCRWP running records, EngageNY module assessments and NYC Performance tasks.  Based upon the results from these 
assessments, students are grouped with others who have similar needs, and they receive small group instruction focused on 
meeting their needs.    
  
This past year, our school consisted of Kindergarten through fifth grade. Based on TCRWP Running Record scores, our data for 
the entire school breaks down as follows:

Our CEP goal was that 70% of our students (including ELLs and SWDs) would move at least 2 Fountas and Pinnell grade levels 
by our last DRA assessment in May. Our data indicates that 79% of our ELLs across the school exceeded our CEP goals. (They 
surpassed the two grade levels). In addition, when analyzing our DRA results, we noticed that many of our ELLs possessed 
excellent decoding skills and sight word recognition.  However, of all our highest-scoring ELLs who were held back by lack of 
familiarity with the vocabulary and syntax of higher-level texts.  We used this data to create the role of push-in ENL teacher to 
help ELLs access higher-level and content-specific vocabulary.  The ENL teachers will also support the classroom teachers in 
order to implement scaffolds and support in order to help the ELLs achieve higher fluency. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Our ENL teachers work closely with the classroom teachers in order to look at student work and determine what structures are 
currently working.  We follow a grade band system where the ENL teachers work with either K-2 or 3-5 in order to be able to 
truly focus on the needs or certain grades. By working closely with teachers and evaluating the results the students have on 
assessments in place, the ENL teachers are able to determine what additional scaffolds need to be implemented. The ENL 
teachers also look at the previous year's NYSESLAT data in order to determine which modality has consistently been low and 
therefore require a goal to be set for the upcoming year. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We have set clear goals for our ELL students in our CEP. We use very specific data to evaluate the success of our programs, 
through both informal and formal assessments. Some examples of these are the TCRWP running records, as well as pre and 
post unit writing samples. As indicated before, the NYSESLAT data confirms that our program is successful. Our expanding 
level ELLs have shown significant improvement in Reading and Writing proficiency.  
 
  
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once interventions have implemented and evaluated, we meet after a period of approximately 8 weeks to assess whether or 
not they have been successful and if not, to determine what steps should be taken next. The ENL teachers meet regularly in 
order to formulate evaluations of the systems and to determine if the current instructional practices are most effective. In the 
previous school year, our school also adopted Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) during our Monday professional 
development time. We use these as another method of evaluating out instructional practices and making research based 
decisions to determine if we have been successful or need to make changes. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school's instructional model is based on RTI.  First, all students receive a strong core of content instruction during our 
heterogeneously-grouped content period.  They participate in read-alouds, hands-on projects and discussion, all organized 
around an interdisciplinary core curriculum.   Then, all students receive math and literacy instruction in small groups based on 
needs we identify through analyzing a variety of data.  Essentially, all of our students receive Tier II interventions.  Finally, for 
students who still struggle, we implement such Tier III interventions as one-on-one tutoring, extra instructional time, after 
school, Imagine Learning etc.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

We analyzed the proficiency levels of our students on the NYSITELL and  NYSESLAT.   There is significant data to show that our 
students moved across the modalities as they became immersed in a language rich curriculum.  
The data shows that we have had great success moving students out of the entering level all the way to expanding, and all of 
our advanced students were also proficient in one or more modalities. Classroom teachers, as well as our ENL teachers, will 
provide targeted support to help them attain proficiency across the board.  We will continue to utilize our programmatic 
structures (i.e., small targeted learning communities, our school-wide academic language focus, etc. ) that helped last year’s 
students progress in order to attain the same success with our new and entering level students this year.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ENL teachers meet regularly to evaluate the progress of the ELLs. Our ENL teachers have also begun implementing student 
portfolios which focus on the four modalities of language. Through the use of these portfolios in combination with regular 
meetings with the classroom teacher in order to evaluate not only language development but content development as well, 
we are able to disseminate our findings and make adjustments to our program. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ELLs at Linden Tree receive standalone ENL in a variety of ways. The entering and emergent level students are 
grouped homogenously in order to receive the instruction they require. The students generally are grouped as a block 
and therefore remain with others in the grade level. The transitioning and expanding level students are also in a block, 
therefore their peers are their same grade, and receive push in service and they are grouped heterogeneously, though 
the ENL teacher will pull aside small homogeneous groupings to work on specific strategies and touch points.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           In compliance with CR Part 154, our entering and emerging level students receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction with 
the licensed ENL teacher who pushes in to their interdisciplinary core class daily. They spend half of that time developing the 
necessary skills for the English language and the other half supporting the content, math, and ELA curriculum. Our 
transitioning and expanding level students receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction with the licensed ENL teacher and they 
participate in math and ELA groups with peers who have similar literacy levels and needs.  The ENL teacher supports the ELLs 
in reading, writing, listening and speaking in all subjects; math, content, and ELA, so the ELL students receive the needed 
support and required time.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

   For content areas,  all students are heterogeneously placed.  Content areas are taught by the homeroom teacher in a 
focused period called “Content Literacy.”  In both of these Science and Social Studies classes, we use a hands-on, experiential 
approach that emphasizes the development of academic language.  In social studies, we use a variety of content rich literature 
in order to provide the students with the needed lessons. In science, we also use the FOSS curriculum to ensure that students 
develop scientific concepts, and both our classroom and ENL teachers help students attach the correct language to these 
concepts. Teachers use the CCLS in order to design instruction and the ENL teachers work to support classroom teachers with 
creating lessons that support the needs of ELLs. In addition, we have Spanish-speaking paraprofessional staff who provide 
additional native language support.  Our entering and emerging ELL's also receive help from a push-in ENL teacher during this 
time. The ENL teacher works directly with the classroom teachers to understand the curriculum and support the ELLs with 
background knowledge and academic vocabulary development.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   In order to ensure that our ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year, we have hired 
both Spanish, Arabic, and Bengali speaking staff members, as these are our main languages other than English. These teachers, 
office staff, and para professionals are available to help assess students or speak with students whenever the need arises. 
Having members of our staff who speak the students home languages help us to maintain a correct understanding of students 
proficiency.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. In order to differentiate instruction for SIFE students, we first identify them using the SIFE oral interview questionaire. After 
they have been identified, we would administer the LENS. Based on the information gained from that assessment, we would 
place the student in a homogenous group, based on his proficiency and provide large amounts of background knowledge as 
well as support from the ENL teacher in a push in format so s/he does not risk missing out on important instruction.  
b. In order to differentiate instruction for newcomers, we will provide them with as much exposure to the language as 
possible, through various read alouds, labels in the classroom, say and repeats, and also some direct instruction in the areas of 
language where they seem to be lacking the most. Essentially, their instruction will always be tailored to their specific needs. 
They will also always be grouped in the classroom in a way that they are with other newcomers as well as other, more 
proficient students who speak their native language (when possible). The ENL Coordinator will work with the classroom 
teachers to identify the best ways to support the students with their language development. The ENL teacher will also push 
into the classroom for the required amount of time, as per CR part 154, in order to best serve the students.  
c. In order to differentiate instruction for developing ELLs, the students will be grouped homogeneously when the classrooms 
are split into small groups, or divided for specific subject areas. The ENL teacher will work with the classroom teacher in order 
to plan instruction that supports their developing language. This may mean providing sentence frames, fewer answer choices, 
or a variety of other accommodations which will provide the opportunity for the ELLS to reach the same curricular goals as 
their peers while having the differentiated support they require. The ENL teacher will also push into these classrooms, for the 
appropriate required minutes per week as per CR part 154,  to provide ELLs with support throughout their lessons. 
d. In order to differentiate instruction for long term ELLs, students will be placed in homogeneous groupings within their 
classroom. The ENL teacher will work closely with the classroom teachers to design instruction that is rich in academic 
language and contains the visual support needed for ELLs. The ENL teacher will also continue to push into these classrooms for 
the amount of time required as per CR part 154 in order to support the ELLs with the academic language and content 
development. Though these students may not require as many accommodations as their newcomer or developing peers, they 
do need some accommodations as they are still missing the essentials of the academic language, which has caused them to be 
long term ELLs. 
e. In order to differentiate for former ELLs, the students will continue to receive 90 minutes of push in support from the ENL 
teacher for two years after exiting the program. This support will most likely be with the expanding academic language and 
skills needed in the classroom. The ENL teacher will also continue to plan with the classroom teacher in order to provide 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

support for him/ her.  
At Linden Tree, we plan to expose the children to the regular curriculum as much as possible and we will offer ENL support as 
long as is needed by our students. We discuss the needs of our ELL students on a regular basis as part of our SIT (Student 
Intervention Team), so that we can address any struggles before they become an instructional hindrance.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
For our  ELL-SWDs,  we use our flexible, small group scheduling model, as well as research-based intervention programs, to 
meet their needs. They participate in the same math curriuclum as the rest of the school, a language-based program called 
EngageNY,  but the teacher increases her emphasis on the teaching and use of mathematical vocabulary and ESL strategies.   In 
language arts, all of our groups utilize a Phonics based program that focuses on language development as well as the use of 
Imagine Learning.  We also incorporate workshop structures where students are taught reading strategies and are given ample 
reading time to practice these strategies.   For the rest of the curriculum, teachers follow a balanced literacy approach, and 
teachers of ELL students infuse extra support with speaking, listening and vocabulary development.  We follow all IEP 
guidelines, including the use of a bilingual paraprofessional to support language development.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
As indicated above, all of our students participate in some heterogeneous, whole-group classes each day, including both 
interdisciplinary core classes ("content literacy") and various special classes, such as gym, story time, art, and choice 
time.  However,all students also participate in small, leveled reading and math groups that focus on meeting their individual 
needs.  Each student is able to receive targeted instruction while still participating in our whole-school curriculum and 
culture.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
For intervention in reading and math, our beginner ELLs are placed together in small groups.  They participate in the same 
math curriuclum as the rest of the school, a standards based program (EngageNY) but the teacher increases her emphasis on 
the teaching and use of mathematical vocabulary and ENL strategies.   In language arts, all of our groups utilize Wilson 
Fundations to teach phonics, and the ENL group also uses additional Wilson Intervention strategies.  ELL students also have 
access to computer-based reading programs, including Imagine Learning, Raz-kids and abc mouse, as well as English for 
Kids.  For the rest of the curriculum, teachers follow a balanced literacy approach, and the teacher of the ENL group infuses 
extra support with speaking, listening and vocabulary development.   In compliance with CR Part 154, our beginner students 
receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction with a qualified licensed ENL pedagogue within their language arts and mathematics 
blocks.  They also receive services from an ENL push-in teacher during their interdisciplinary core content time. 
  
Our advanced ELL’s participate in math and ELA groups with peers who have similar literacy levels and needs.  Teachers infuse 
reading, writing, listening and speaking into all classes, so the ELL students receive in-class support.  In addition, these students 
receive 180 minutes a week of push-in instruction with our ESL provider. 
  
Our former ELLs continue to receive ELA and math instruction in small groups tailored to their individual needs.  Within these 
groups, teachers will be responsible for providing the support and scaffolding necessary for the students to succeed.  We will 
continue testing accomodations for former ELLs according to state guidelines.  
  
Social Studies and Science content curriculums are linked to our ELA and math curriculums. Therefore, the students receive 
content rich academic language support which mirrors the support they are receiving in their reading and math small groups. 
Our school is built on the foundation of developing strong language skills that provide the students with the tools they need to 
work the the CCLS in all areas of the curriculum. 
   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on trends, we have hired a second full time ENL teacher in order to fully support our growing population of ELLs. We 
have also decided to break apart the ENL case load into grade bands. By placing one ENL teacher with grades K-2 and the other 
with 3-5, we feel the ENL teacher will be able to build a full competency with the grade band as well as a comfort and certain 
level of expectancy with the teacher as well as the students as far or their needs and curriculum demands. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ELL students have equal access to all school programs.  ELL students are integrated into all of our homerooms, so they 
receive all additional classes, including PE, technology, arts education, alongside our native English speakers.  We also have a 
variety of extra programs, such as drama and music which come into our school and work with the student body in order to 
expand their knowledge and evaluation. As a school who has regularly received the Title III grant, we have also created a 
supplemental program which takes place two days a week after school in order to support our ELLs. We also offer a four week 
ENL summer enrichment program which is designed to help prepare ELLs for the academic demands of the following grade as 
well as to help prevent the summer lag where students often spend their time speaking in their native language. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our classrooms are full of high-quality, developmentally appropriate early childhood materials to support language 
development.  In literacy, we create a language-rich environment through the use of frequent read-alouds with visual support 
(e.g. big books), listening center activities, and computer-based programs, such as Raz-kids, which provides students with both 
picture and voice support.  Our ELL students also use Imagine Learning. In math, we use EngageNY however, we still 
incorporate language objectives in these lessons.  In science, we use FOSS kits, which are designed to help students acquire 
vocabulary after first developing their conceptual knowledge.  In social studies, we use a variety of hands-on and print 
materials to build background knowledge and the corresponding vocabulary.  All of our classrooms contain Smartboards so 
teachers can build additional visual support and interactivity into their lessons.  In addition, our kindergarten homeroom 
classes all incorporate dramatic play and blocks centers, in which ELL students can practice their oral language with native 
English speakers.   All of these instructional resources provide students with age-appropriate support. 
   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Our Freestanding ENL program offers native language support where possible, through the use of bilingual 
paraprofessionals.  Parent communication inviting participation in school events is sent home in multiple languages and our 
support staff follows up with phone calls.  Our school-wide events, such as our Cultural Fair and PTA family fun nights are 
attended by students from all language backgrounds.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

By allowing students to receive the appropriate instructional time, per CR-154, from the ENL teacher, we ensure that the 
ELLs receive the appropriate services and resources. Students are placed in their grade according to age, therefore they are 
with peers who share their level of maturity. By allowing the ENL teachers to focus on a specific grade level band, we feel the 
students are also receiving grade appropriate content as the teachers work closely to implement the curriculum along with 
appropriate scaffolds. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our classrooms are full of high-quality, developmentally appropriate early childhood materials to support language 
development.  In literacy, we create a language-rich environment through the use of frequent read-alouds with visual support 
(e.g. big books), listening center activities, and computer-based programs, such as Raz-kids, which provides students with both 
picture and voice support.  Our ELL students also use Imagine Learning. In math, we use EngageNY however, we still

incorporate language objectives in these lessons.  In science, we use FOSS kits, which are designed to help students acquire 
vocabulary after first developing their conceptual knowledge.  In social studies, we use a variety of hands-on and print 
materials to build background knowledge and the corresponding vocabulary.  All of our classrooms contain Smartboards so 
teachers can build additional visual support and interactivity into their lessons.  In addition, our kindergarten homeroom 
classes all incorporate dramatic play and blocks centers, in which ELL students can practice their oral language with native 
English speakers.   All of these instructional resources provide students with age-appropriate support. 
   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Each year, we hold parent orientation meetings, hosted by our ENL teachers, to help prepare new parents and answer their 
questions.  At these meetings, our Spanish and Arabic-speaking staff members help translate as necessary. We also use the 
language line to assist other parents as needed.  In addition, we send home any materials in multiple languages.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Linden Tree was created with a focus on language development. In every curriclum area; in ELA, Math,  and Content Literacy, 
there is a strong emphasis on language development. Because there are identified ELL's in all classes, every common branch 
teacher receives ELL strategies to incorporate within their planning and implementation of instruction. For the upcoming 
school year, as per CR part 154, 15% of the total PD will be dedicated to language acquisition. Additionally, 50% of the required 
PD will be dedicated to language acquisition for our bilingual and ENL teachers.    
This past year our district provided ENL professional development to a cohort of ENL coordinators. The coordinator then turn 
keyed this information to the staff during monthly grade level meetings, ensuring ENL strategies are embedded within our 
instruction. All common branches teachers receive PD on a daily basis with the instructional coach who, in turn, provides ENL 
strategy support.  ENL concerns are addressed as needed.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The mandated hours of training as specified by CR part 154 at that all teachers will receive 15% of their total hours in the area 
of language acquisition. Much of this training will be presented by the ENL Coordinator. These trainings will occur monthly 
during our required PD time. The following is a list of topics that will be addressed each month. The ENL Coordinator will also 
debrief with the classroom teachers during formal grade level meetings regarding the information she has obtained during the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

off-site language acquisition PD workshops she has attended. In order to document this, we use Google docs and share all 
documents with any staff member in attendance during a specific meeting. 
  
In addition, as per CR part 154, the ENL teachers are required to receive 50% of their PD hours in the field of language 
acquisition. She will be attending numerous half of full day workshops, provided by the BFSC, in the area of language 
acquisition. The topics of the workshops vary; some of the first workshops she will be attending are language progressions, 
writing across all subjects, and integrated teaching to support language acquisition.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents in our school are supported from the moment they enroll their children at Linden Tree.   
All parents are welcomed to orientations before the school year starts, and they are assisted in completing the Home 
Language survey accurately to identify potential ELL students.   
Bilingual staff members and parents assist in translation at these events.  After assessment through the NYSITELL, students in 
need of ENL services are identified.  All parents of ELL students are invited to attend an orientation and informational meeting 
at the beginning of the year.  This meeting is presented using videos and written materials in the families’ home languages, 
and bilingual staff members and parents assist with translation.  At the meeting, we inform parents of the language programs 
available for their children.  Parents are also provided with a description of the ENL program offered at Linden Tree, and staff 
address any questions and concerns.  At this time, parents complete the parent survey and  program selection.  
Each subsequent year, parents of ELLs are invited to an annual individual meeting to discuss goals of the program, as well as 
proficiency results. There will be a translator available to be present at these meetings as needed.    
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Throughout the year, we encourage parent involvement for all students.  Early in the year, we survey parents about their 
cultural backgrounds in order to celebrate the diversity of our student body, and we also survey them about specific needs in 
order to provide family support. The Parent Coordinator provides support and information regarding community services to 
families. Parent communication is established and maintained during the year through consistent phone calls, progress 
reports, report cards, and one-to-one meetings.  Correspondence, including monthly academic updates and notices of 
upcoming events, is sent home in multiple languages.  Translation services are also provided for parents when necessary, 
especially during parent-teacher conferences.  Parents are invited to attend celebrations to share their child’s growth, as well 
as holiday and birthday celebrations.  They are also invited to attend school-wide programs that include performances 
highlighting  their children’s special talents.  As part of a campus school, we work in conjunction with MS 127. We are in the 
process of establishing workshops for parents based on their interests, for example; English language skills, homework help, 
and more. The parent coordinator and the ENL Coordinator work together to identify the needs and interests of the ELL 
parents.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lisa Debonis, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When students are admitted to Linden Tree, a licensed pedagogue administers the Home Language Interview 
Survey (HLIS), and the secretary records this information in ATS. If we determine that the parent has language and 
interpretation needs, we utilize bilingual staff members, parent volunteers, or adult family members of the 
student to assist in translation. Our Community Associate works with each family to ensure we have a contact 
person for home-school communication, and she notes this information on the blue emergency cards. In turn, she 
shares this information with each child's classroom teacher. 

Linden Tree has families with the following home languages: 

Bengali 

Spanish

Arabic  

Pashto 

Urdu 

Vietnamese 

Tagalog 

Chinese 

Russian 

We correspond with our families in the various ways: backpacked letters, recorded phone messages, individual 
phone calls, parent meetings, email, website updates, and social networking sites. All of our correspondence is in 
both English and Spanish. When information comes from the DOE, it is also sent in Bangla and Arabic. Our 
Bangladeshi, Urdu, and Pashto speaking families either read English (the majority of them) or can rely upon adult 
friends and relatives for translation assistance. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

We use phone blasts and our classroom messaging program; Class DOJO 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor's Regulation !-663 in a few different ways. Our 
ENL coordinator meets with the classroom teachers monthly. During these meetings, she will emphasize the 
importance of using google translate or other services to ensure that LEP parents are receiving pertinent school 
information in their preferred language. We will also work with the office staff and parent coordinator to ensure that 
notices sent out continue to be available to parents in their preferred languages. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We fulfill Section VII of Chancellor's Regulation A-663, regarding parental requirements for translation and 
interpretation services. We send home the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities to all students whose family's 
primary language is a covered language. As part of a campus school, signs are posted near the entrance indicating the 
availability of interpretation services, and our safety plan contains procedures for ensuring that parents in need of 
language access services are not prevented from reaching the school's administrative offices solely due to language 
barriers. Oral and written communication is provided at all events in languages other than English when requested by 
parents. All written communication will be translated in languages other than English when needed. All student 
progress, health, safety, legal, disciplinary, Special Education, ELL status and non-standard academic programs will be 
made available to all parents of Linden Tree. During parent engagement events, we strive to involve all families by 
securing staff or making connections for families to ensure that there is someone available to interpret for all 
languages that we think may be present or necessary at a given event. During our various events, we hep encourages 
connections between families who are from the same background in order to encourage collaboration. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Through the parent survey, we will measure the effectiveness of our translation and interpretation measures. With a 
small school, we are also able to directly maintain communication (via teacher and administration meetings) with all 
of our families to ensure they are receiving and obtaining the necessary information. Our parent coordinator offers 
parent workshops and constant communication for all parents. She is outside greeting families each and every day 
and available for parent feedback. We are also offering per session funding for staff members who can communicate 
with parents during non-school hours. These languages include Spanish, Bengali and Arabic. Through our many 
communication services, our parent coordinator is able to assess whether or not parents feel that they are receiving 
ample and effective information from our school. To date, we are able to translate information effectively in order to

adequately inform all of our parents. Our ENL coordinator also meets with parents regularly and makes herself 
available whenever parents have questions or concerns. We strive to use available interpreters or interpreting 
services in order to ensure that all parents feel they have a place in our school.
