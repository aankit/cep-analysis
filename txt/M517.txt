Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The school’s mission is to prepare each student with high levels of skill, knowledge and competence to flourish in 
secondary and post-secondary education and in the 21 st century global society. A fully-inclusive model that brings 
together children of different backgrounds and abilities, while the instructional program responds to children’s 
individual learning needs and strengths. There are systems and resources that support children’s development, not 
just academically, but also socially, emotionally and physically.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

A central tenet of the school’s vision is that it serves the surrounding community with integrated services for children 
and families that encourage happy/healthy living, high educational aspirations and social engagement. Early 
childhood education, family engagement, social and emotional support services and extended school learning 
experiences establishes the school as a hub for community programming.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Teachers College Community School (TCCS) is a growing public Pre K-8 school that is presently at Sixth grade. 
TCCS is a high quality non-selective option for children living in community school districts 5 and 6.  

 

The academic program emphasizes high standards, educational opportunity and innovation. The School’s instructional 
program has six core features: 1) educational foundations that develop children’s knowledge and skills in core 
disciplines; 2) learning about the world that enables students to succeed in our 21 st century global society; 3) 
independent inquiry that fosters creativity and engagement among young learners; 4) an inclusive environment that 
brings together people of different backgrounds and abilities; 5) technology that is integrated into everyday learning; 
and 6) holistic supports that attend to children’s academic, social, emotional and physical well-being.  

Teachers College has an ongoing role in the school, and share accountability for student success. Through this 
affiliation TC commits to:  

 Assist in the development and evaluation of curriculum  

 Participate in school governance, planning and operations  

 Provide professional development for teachers  

 Provide mentors, tutors and interns to enrich learning  

 Build public and private partnerships to support the school  

 

 

 

Collaboratively, administration, teachers, parents and the SLT worked through our problem of practice to create a 
shared Theory of Action and to set goals of accountability to support our desired outcome:  

If we plan strategically to intellectually engage our students via use of varied data-based strategies, along with 
promoting student ownership of the learning process, then we can tailor instruction to meet the iindividual needs of 
students to demonstrate mastery of standards.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Our Students with Disabilities Comprise 17% and our English as a New Language students comprise2% of our 
population. These students range from pre-k through Grade 7. Both subgroups requires mandated services from 
identified specialists. It is the expectation that Specialized services collaborate with administration, teachers, staff and 
parents to create and employ impacting strategies and services to support our students in their learning environment.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Areas of the framework that TCCS has made significant gains in are communication, collaboration of teachers and 
supportive environment. Our 2016 Quality Review celebrated us as as well-developed in indicator 3.4 "High 
Expectations" and proficient in areas of QR indicators 1.1 & 1.2 (Curriculum & Pedagogy). An area of improvement has 
been noted under QR indicator 4.2 (Teacher Teams). We have supported teacher teams via strategic programming, 
inquiry and teachers supports in pedagogy and instruction. , which in turn has impacted our teacher teams 
effectiveness as noted in our latest Principals Performance Observation.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

The Teachers College Community School (TCCS) opened in September 2011 with a Kindergarten class and will grow to 
eighth grade. There will be long-term trends to assess and analyze, based on NYS testing data. 

 

Our 2016 Quality Review celebrated us as as well-developed in indicator 3.4 "High Expectations" and cited growth in 
previously needed areas of QR indicators 1.1 & 1.2 (Curriculum & Pedagogy). An area of improvement has been noted 
under QR indicator 4.2 (Teacher Teams). Results from our NYS ELA 2018 testing data indicated that 56% of our grades 
3-7 students are on or above grade level. Our Math data from 2018 Math State tests yielded 48% of all grades 3-7 
students are performing at levels 3 and 4.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, students will improve fluency and comprehension skills resulting in a 20% overall growth in proficiency as 
measured by 2019 NYS Math and ELA Examinations.

1. Through the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project we 
focus on capacity building for the school by providing intensive 
training for key staff like the principal, lead teacher and 
classroom teachers. We accomplish the establishment of model 
and demonstration sites (classrooms) on every grade to provide 
hands-on experiences for teachers.  

All 
pedagogical 
staff  

Professional development is continuous and reflective of the 
activities supported in the Teachers College Reading and Writing 
Project’s units of study. We conduct study groups, teacher 
meetings and workshops where staff plan for results and study 
best practices as a part of their training. The two Teachers 
College staff developers spend three cycles of full-day support 
over eight months in the school; helping us to realize many 
things about student and educator learning.  

Teachers College Reading and Writing Project employs a 
complete approach to literacy that utilizes instructional 
approaches for reading and writing that are supported by 
research. During a two and a half-hour daily block, there is thirty 
minutes of word study instruction, a one-hour reading 
workshop, and a one-hour writing workshop. The workshops are 
designed to make sure students develop strong reading and 
writing skills in many different genres. During the block, there is 
whole class instruction as well as one-on-one and one-on-four 
teaching. The combination of these approaches has been shown 
to be the most effective approach to literacy instruction. The 
design includes classroom rituals and routines designed to 
cultivate effective teaching and learning (Black and William, 
1998).  

This approach to literacy instruction is consistent with the 
comprehensive review of research conducted by the National 
Research Council (NRC). The NRC defines adequate reading 
instruction as that which helps children obtain meaning from 
print, understand the sounds of individual and groups of letters 
and the specifics of spelling-sound relationships, and 
understand the structure of words and the nature of the writing 
system (National Research Council, 1998). According to the NRC, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

a complete approach to literacy attends to oral language, the 
recognition of letters, phonemic awareness, decoding skills, 
comprehension, writing, spelling, and grammar and provides 
frequent opportunities to read and write.  

Teachers College Reading and Writing Project also provides staff 
with training to translate workshop concepts, methodologies, 
strategies, approaches and techniques into effective use of 
technology, and addressing the standards.  

2. Teachers Conceptual understanding of Math and efficiency of 
using data to strategically plan small group instruction is being 
addressed through grade team meetings and staff development 
and monitored.  

3. Observational rounds will monitor and encourage through 
actionable next steps to advance learning in ELA and Math 
instructional practices.  

4. Systematic changes in scheduling and programming to 
support flexible scheduling and allow for collaboration 
horizontally and vertically will be created and adhered to. 

5. Use of interventionists, provided by Teachers College, to align 
provision of services to targeted groups of students in areas of 
ELA and Math for enrichment and intervention.  

6. Professional development and instructional focus will support 
and challenge teachers to try varied instructional approaches to 
meet the needs of all students. TCCS will strategically use data 
to plan to create varied access points for students with 
disabilities, English as a new language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups 

7. Teachers will strategically use data to assist students in 
setting goal and specific strategies to help them achieve their 
goals to guide an anchored area of focus.  

 

8. We have departmentalized in Math and ELA for grades 5, 6 & 
7 to allow more differentiated instructional focus. 

 

9. Teachers will use introduce and Instructional tools ( i.e. TC 
Progressions, rubrics and fluency ladders) to help students self 
monitor and self-assess their progress,

10. ULIT coach will provide professional development and in 
class coaching in the area of reading ( grades k-2). Focus will 
consist of word study and phonemic awareness.  

11. TCCS values parents as learning partners and this is 
celebrated by their outstanding participation in our school 
community. Our parent coordinator has fostered close 
relationships with our parents by being a strong resource as she 
is sought out for assistance in facilitating workshops, seeking 
summer resources for students and maintaining a link to the 
CEC and district level community.  

Every student has a communication folder where teachers can 
inform parents about their child’s progress and any other 
information they feel they want to share with parents. Parents 
can communicate with the teacher about their child’s progress, 
questions they have about their child or share information with 
the teacher.  

We have an active Parent Association. The PA is proactive and 
highly successful in reaching out to parents and inviting them to 
attend meetings and workshops.  

TCCS has a variety of methods to provide parents with vital 
school information, such as: the principal’s newsletter updates, 
principal, monthly address, a monthly calendar of school events, 
details on upcoming workshops, school trips, minutes from PA 
and SLT meetings, details regarding ongoing research and 
studies being conducted in the school, weekly highlights from 
teachers, class pictures and movies, etc.  

In addition, TCCS is implementing family education programs 
designed to help parents to better assist their children, further 
their own education, and become active school participants.  

12. Parents are invited to view classroom practices the last 
Friday of every month at TCCS. Each month there is a different 
instructional focus. So, parents are able to view the full 
educational experience their child is receiving. After each 
‘Parents as Learning Partners’ session, the principal holds a 
debriefing. This is an open forum for parents to comment/ask 
questions on whatever they have viewed that morning or 
address any other concerns they may have in general. This type 
of open access has strengthened the home/school connection 
and built trust within the entire school community. 

 
 

 
3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

At TCCS we pride ourselves in the work we do to strengthen our home-school connection. We host curriculum Night 
to allow our parents to know what their child will know by the end of the year. We host our parent engagement time 
weekly on Tuesdays to allow our parents to meet with teachers and staff to discuss students performance and needs. 
We invite all families to our monthly Parents as Learning Partners ( PLP) to visit their child's class to learn side by side 
in varied content area. We then meet afterwards for "coffee with the Principal" and discuss their noticings, this 
proves to provide insight of connecting the home-correspondence of units of study and strategies our students are 
encouraged to use. We host Student led conferences 3 times a year to allow our students to share with their parents 
their working goals, what they do well and areas they need to strengthen. The students share what they have to do to 
achieve their goals. We send home report cards 4 times a year and Progress reports twice a year to inform parents of 
where their child is performing in relation to the standards and progress that is being exhibited. Homework packets 
go home weekly with a summary of the focus of Units. These practices are supported by the teachers and 
administration.  

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
The human and instructional resources required are: securing contracted consultants/ staff developers, classroom 
teachers, support staff, specialty teachers, professional texts, extensive classroom libraries (leveled & by genre) and 
instructional materials.  

In addition, the scheduling blocks of time for teacher professional development requires per-diem subs for coverage. 

Teachers College will have an ongoing role in the school, and share accountability for student success. Through this 
affiliation TC commits to:  

● Assist in the development and evaluation of curriculum. 

● Participate in school governance, planning and operation.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our 2018-2019 Online Occurrence Reporting System demonstrated a significant decrease of infractions during the the 
academic school year. This data demonstrated the need for establish school-wide expectations of behaviors and 
systems for progressive discipline to hold students accountable. 

Our school culture and climate team have two long-range goals. The first goal is to provide early prevention programs 
that all families and teachers of young children can use to promote positive social, emotional, and academic 
competence. The second goal is to provide comprehensive interventions for teachers and parents that are targeted to 
meet academic and behavioral needs of our students. 

TCCS has established a Positive Behavioral Intervention System (PBIS) Team that uses school-wide rules and 
procedures that reinforce what teachers are implementing inside the classroom. This team works with staff to:  

 Strengthen children's social skills and appropriate play skills (turn taking, waiting, asking, sharing, helping, 
complimenting).  

 Promote children's use of self-regulating strategies such as effective problem solving.  

 Increase emotional awareness by labeling feelings, recognizing the differing views of self and others. 

 Promote academic success. 

 Increase self-esteem and self-confidence.  

This framework will also be supported instructionally via social emotional curriculum ( Second Step). As our school 
population increases and student needs are increasingly diverse, instruction must be adjusted to be accessible to all 
learners. In order to fuel student engagement, instruction and meaningful opportunities for students to interact with 
new material must be differentiated depending on student functioning level as well as preferred learning style. 
Student engagement is built when students are provided with varied supports as well as extra challenges and are able 
to participate in learning tasks that involve high levels of student choice. It is also important that the school as a 
whole, classroom teachers, specialty teachers, and service providers are actively and effectively communicating with 
parents. Engaged families who know the expectations of the classroom, the curriculum, and the way in which they 
can support their child’s learning in a classroom culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged. The 
school aims to continue a successful and strong school and classroom culture by building student engagement as well 
as overall family engagement. We aim to create more opportunities for families to participate in the classroom. 

We also are invested in expanding our social-emotional understanding and interaction through using Yale's research 
based methodology of RULER. The initial phase is inclusive of teachers, staff and administration working to become

"emotional scientists" by discussing how emotions matter and working on a charter to capture how we want to feel in 
our learning environment. This work is serving as a foundation to roll out to our students and families. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 80% of students will demonstrate identified behavioral characteristics ( PBIS Matrix) resulting in a 
maintenance of decreased of Level III infractions via OORS.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

All teachers will utilize data to make instructional decisions 
across a school wide continuum.  

 Teachers assess and identify at-risk students within their 
classrooms and target instruction in small groups or one-on-one 
instruction for improvement.  

 If a classroom teacher determines that the Tier 1 interventions 
he/she has administered have not yielded the desired results, 
they will make a referral to the Academic Intervention Team 
(AIT).  

 The AIT will analyze the data submitted by a classroom teacher 
and make a recommendation for Tier II intervention services or 
alternative Tier 1 interventions for the classroom teacher to 
attempt.  

 If the AIT’s data analysis reveals the need for more targeted 
intervention by a specialty teacher. The team will assess, analyze 
and develop a personalized individual plan (PIP) to best serve the 
student’s identified area(s) of need.  

 The AIT will continue to analyze student data and monitor 
student progress or lack thereof.  

 AIT members will analyze whether: interventions were 
successful, if additional or alternate intervention services are 
required. 

Families will be incorporated into the process by having 
communication with the interventionists and case manager.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our 2015-2016 Quality Review indicated that an area of improvement is 4.2 ( Teacher Teams. Although, fared very 
well in Teacher collaboration in that the majority of teachers are engaged in structured professional collaborations 
and teacher teams analyze assessment data for students they share. However, the use of an inquiry approach is 
developing across teacher teams. The analysis of assessment data does not typically result in progress toward goals 
for groups of students. Therefore, systems and structures need to be created to use an inquiry approach to look at 
student data to impact student performance. We have partnered with Learning Partners Program to establish inquiry 
cycles to support student learning.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teacher teams will systematically use an inquiry approach to analyze student work to modify 
teacher practice and instructional strategies to aide mastery of goals for groups of students, evidenced by an increase in 
student performance of targeted students.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
As stated earlier, e pride ourselves in the work we do to strengthen our home-school connection. Our teachers are 
accessible to collaborate with parents during scheduled parent - engagement blocks, via email, telephone and 
scheduled meetings. We host a Pre-k & K family social event t allow incoming parents to meet with the instructors 
and peers. Administration presents a parent survey in the Fall and Spring to gage perceptions of trust, support and 
communication. The results are shared with the SLT and Parent Association so that we can set goals together and 
assess effectiveness of our action plan. We invite all families to our monthly Parents as Learning Partners ( PLP) to visit 
their child's class to learn side by side in varied content area. This allows parents to see taught strategies applied 
within the classroom environment and helps assist their understanding s that they may support ate home. We host 
Student led conferences 3 times a year to allow our students to share with their parents their working goals, what 
they do well and areas they need to strengthen. The students share what they have to do to achieve their goals. We 
send home report cards 4 times a year and Progress reports twice a year to inform parents of where their child is 
performing in relation to the standards and progress that is being exhibited. Homework packets go home weekly with 
a summary of the focus of Units. These practices are supported by the teachers and administration.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As a school, effective communication is important and necessary in order to continue to nurture the professional 
growth of teachers. Part of creating a strong school community is creating an open door policy with the staff and 
developing the leadership capacity among teachers in order to grow strong teacher leaders. Additionally, it is 
important for effective leaders to provide teachers with choice about areas of professional development growth, 
guidance for professional growth areas, and to provide teachers with the support that will ultimately drive student 
achievement. We are a growing school therefore need to hire new staff yearly. It is essential to build trust and 
retention of staff to creates a sustainable and coherent culture.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, administration will build sustainability through strategic teaming, professional development and culture 
building events resulting in at least 85% of 2018-19 staff returning for the 2020-21 school year as evidenced by the 
Table of Organization.

1. Every student has a communication folder where teachers can 
inform parents about their child’s progress and any other 
information they feel they want to share with parents. Parents 
can communicate with the teacher about their child’s progress, 
questions they have about their child or share information with 
the teacher.  

Parents

Principal, All 
pedagogical staff  

2. Parents are invited to view classroom practices the last Friday 
of every month at TCCS. Each month there is a different 
instructional focus. So, parents are able to view the full 
educational experience their child is receiving. After each 
‘Parents as Learning Partners’ session, the principal holds a 
debriefing. This is an open forum for parents to comment/ask 
questions on whatever they have viewed that morning or 
address any other concerns they may have in general. This type 
of open access has strengthened the home/school connection 
and built trust within the entire school community. 

3.Using Kinsolve, we communicate events, absences, lateness 
and announcements about PA meetings.  

Parents  

4. We have an active Parent Association. The PA is proactive and 
highly successful in reaching out to parents and inviting them to 
attend meetings and workshops.  

5. TCCS has a variety of methods to provide parents with vital 
school information, such as: the principal’s newsletter updates, 
principal monthly address,monthly coffee and chat with the 
Principal, a monthly calendar of school events, details on 
upcoming workshops, school trips, minutes from PA and SLT 
meetings, details regarding ongoing research and studies being 
conducted in the school, weekly highlights from teachers, class 
pictures and movies, etc.  

6. TCCS is implementing family education programs designed to 
help parents to better assist their children, further their own 
education, and become active school participants.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. TCCS, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

TCCS will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

TCCS, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing 
a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this 
Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic 
achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children 
achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
TCRWP reading assessments are used to assess student’s English reading levels. Teachers use this data to set goals and inform 
instruction. Students are being assessed every six weeks to ensure they’re meeting their set goal. This data allows teachers to 
identify the strengths and weaknesses of students in their native language. ELLs in grades 3 - 6 will also be screened through 
the ELL Periodic Assessments to find their strengths in the four modalities and use this data to inform instruction.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

An assessment calendar is provided to teachers at the beginning of the year with clear assessment windows and 
deadlines.  Administration compiles this data into a Student Assessment Master to track student data at a glance throughout 
the year and ensure a response is made in classrooms. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the programs for ELL's is evaluated by the outcomes of assessments, growth of students' progress, and analysis 
of students' work, NYSESLAT results and running record independent reading levels.     
The Fall & Spring ELL Periodic Assessment performance is also an indicator in grades 3-6. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The school SIT team reviews student data from the Student Assessment Tracker at regular intervals (biweekly) and ensures the 
necessary interventions are put into place. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Tier I: The Wilson research-based Fundations program is implemented daily for approximately 30 minutes as part of the word 
study block within the general education classroom as part of the core curriculum for students in grades K-2.  Student progress 
is monitored every five to six weeks and additional supports are added in consultation with the ESL certified teachers on 
grades K - 2.  Each grade band discusses the progress of students at weekly grade team members and the specialist help the 
classroom teacher to develop appropriate strategies to address appropriate instruction including instruction that is 
linguistically and culturally responsive.  This means that instruction and interventions must consider and build upon a student’s 
cultural background and experiences as well as their linguistic proficiency (in both English and the native language) and review 
the student’s socio-cultural background to address culturally and linguistically-based issues of motivation and the student’s 
prior knowledge of the material being learned or studied. 
 
Tier II: Based upon assessment data, students at risk of reading failure may receive additional instruction from an Academic 
Intervention Support Specialist and/or an ESL provider in small group push in services.   The ESL provider can help the 
classroom teacher in the development of academic English Language through the use of cognates and making learning 
meaningful for the student.   
 
Tier III: Referral for a special education evaluation if failure to progress from Tier I and Tier II services will be warranted based 
on the SIT team's review of the student data and curricular modifications indicating the need for additional understanding of 
student needs. If student is classified as disabled the provision of special education services.  Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction is 
tailored to meet ELLs’ language needs and is incorporated into research-based intervention strategies. 
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Prior performance levels indicate that students have previously progressed on the NYSESLAT.  We analyze the NYSESLAT to 
identify the modality that students are having the most difficulty in to give them additional practice and culturally responsive 
instruction throughout the year.  We note that students need further support in writing, as progression in scores in this 
particular strand appears to be weak. It is concerning that some students at the Advanced Level (now Expanding) have been 
functioning in this domain for several years and we will address how we are delivering these ENL students are not 
academically proficient in their native language so we continue to try different approaches to meet the needs of these 
students. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The SIT team reviews student data at bi weekly intervals to monitor student progress.  We will use the EDAT tool to identify 
and intervene for at-risk students, and we will conduct specialty teacher meetings to address student needs. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Kindergarten through Fourth Grade students who qualify to receive ESL services will receive instruction by a licensed 
ESL teacher.  This may be in a stand alone or integrated model as determined by student progression (proficiency 
levels).  The integrated delivery model allows the certified ESL teacher to go into the classrooms to provide ESL 
instruction. This takes place after collaboration with the classroom teacher.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 Our school does not offer this program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Our school does not offer this program.    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

          
ENL lessons occur daily in our K-2 monolingual classrooms and are delivered by a Common Branch/ESL licensed 
teacher.  ESL services are also provided as a push in model to students in grades 3-6 to meet their mandated minutes.  The 
ESL provider works in support of the learning objectives in the classroom and modifies the instruction in small group to reach 
the needs of the ENL student.   
 
    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   At TCCS, the ESL program model is the only model used. Classroom teachers collaborate with ENL teachers to employ the 
TCRWP Curriculum and TERC Investigations for the literacy and math program. Both programs are supplemented as needed, 
based on recommendations driven by student need. Both programs include student workbooks as well as teacher texts, and 
both programs are supported by staff developers that visit classroom teachers.  These staff developers coach classroom 
teachers in reaching students with diverse learning needs, including ENL students. Furthermore, teachers will use the following 
instructional approaches and methods to make content comprehensible to enrich language development:  
1. Differentiated instruction  
2. Thematic interdisciplinary instruction  
3. Music is an excellent vehicle for language learning specifically using songs, vocabulary, sentence structure, rhythm and 
intonation can reinforce language development.  
4. Integrating the four skills (listening, speaking, reading, and writing)  
5. Modeling Techniques for content area  
6. Integrating context and language goals and objectives  
7. Direct vocabulary instruction (specific attention for ENL students) 
8. Scaffolding  
 
The reading workshop model which includes explicit modeled instruction for students to comprehend text as well as write 
independently.  Teachers employ the use of visuals or gestures to convey key concepts to ensure comprehensible input of 
reading strategies.  Each lesson has a quick teacher demonstration and model to guide students through the use of the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

strategy.  Lessons refer students back to previous knowledge to make connections to their prior experiences or shared 
experiences.  Teachers use "think alouds" to demonstrate their thinking process to help students as well.   
 
Teachers use the units of study to teach various forms of writing using the workshop model, including narratives, essays, all 
about books, how-to books, poetry and realistic fiction. Teachers use the writing process as well as backward planning to 
implement the units of study in writing. Classroom libraries are leveled and organized by theme or genre.  
 
Teachers engage students in small group guided lessons with a focus on building content knowledge, decoding, fluency and 
comprehension skills in students.  In each grade band, an ENL teacher is available to support students by offering strategies to 
their colleagues of best practices.  TCRWP Staff Developers also model best approaches for diverse students for staff 
members. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   TCCS is a small school with grades PreK through Grade 6 for ELLs whose home language is not Spanish, there is no home 
language assessment. If there are students whose home language is Spanish and scored as an ELL on the NYSITELL, the 
students will be administered the Spanish LAB and the results will be used to inform instruction. These students may be given 
opportunities to read materials in their home language.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. Currently, we do not have SIFE. However, in the event that we do, we will provide small group instruction utilizing visuals 
and hands on activities. Instructional materials are available to teachers to provide appropriate lessons. The Related Service 
Provider Coordinator and TCRWP Consultants provide assistance to the classroom teacher in adapting the curriculum and 
materials for the SIFE student. The ESL teacher works with these students and provides instruction in English to promote 
literacy skills, letter and sound relationships, phonics and number sense. 
 
All SIFE students are grouped together for additional instructional support. Materials are provided on the instructional level of 
students and instruction is delivered by certified teachers. Fundations will be utilized as an intervention program in the 
classroom to provide instruction in reading. 
 
b. When a student first arrives at school, a plan is in place to determine his/her English proficiency. The process is similar for 
new monolingual students. Informal assessments are conducted and a review of test history, attendance, grades and other 
records are reviewed by administrators or an assessment liaison to determine the proper class placement or any special 
services needed. The parent is given an orientation regarding programs and services that are available in the school. TCCS will 
offer a full range of parent workshops to assist them in working with their children, as well as to help them improve their 
literacy and math skills.  
 
c.  For students that are developing,  strong emphasis is placed on building background knowledge, developing fluency, 
improvement in reading and writing skills, and a strong ESL integration component to help the child transition into a 
monolingual setting. The students receive ongoing assessments and various tools are used the TCRWP assessments, teacher-
made assessments, unit tests and NYSESLAT. The administration and teachers compile a wealth of data, the analysis of which 
will determine the strategies to be implemented for the student. For ELLs that are developing, a close examination of data is 
required. The classroom teachers, along with the NY State Certified ESL teacher will review NYSESLAT scores to determine 
student strengths and areas of focus. This along with close monitoring of the students in the classroom setting will help 
provide the tools necessary to create a learning plan for the student. Ongoing assessments will help determine progress 
towards identified targets. An inquiry team has been established to look closely and monitor small groups of ELLs in different 
grades. This analysis will help to inform best practices in assessments, lesson planning, and next steps for all our ELLs at TCCS.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 
d. Currently TCCS does not have Long-Term ELLs. However, should we receive any in the future, we would provide intensive 
services during the day by the NY State Certified ESL teacher as well as the Academic Intervention Services in small groups to 
target individual needs.  
 
e. For former ELLs, use of data will be required to determine the best approach for instruction. The classroom teacher, along 
with the NY State Certified ESL teacher, will review prior performance on NYSESLAT to identify areas of strength as well as 
focus.  The students will continue to receive ESL services a minimum of 90 minutes for two years and supports as needed.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All curricular materials used offer teachers strategies and scaffolds to support English Language Learners as well as ELL-
SWD's.  We have two trained Orton Gillingham teachers who offer their expertise to colleagues to address the needs of all of 
our struggling students.  The TCRWP workshops include daily opportunities for students to hear and repeat academic 
language, rehearse thoughts, and opportunities for turn and talk with other students. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Flexible programming is offered in the least restrictive setting to ensure that all students with disabilities that are also 
identified as ELL students receive rigorous instruction. Common Core Learning Standards and relevant professional 
development support teachers in using curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of ELL-SWD's.  Our ELL-SWD's receive 
SETSS supports from a certified Bilingual teacher who analyzes the need to integrate ELL supports into strategy sessions.   
  
  
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our intervention structure is designed to identify students and pair them with the appropriate support to meet their needs in 
ELA and Math.  We offer monolingual supports in ELA and Math in a push in model utilizing guided reading, guided math, and 
guided writing supports for all students to write in the content areas. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will embark on the use of more technology specifically apps to provide students with an integrated experience where they 
can utilize more modalities of language development and have opportunities to engage with animated video. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have not had a bilingual program 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
TCCS has a myriad of programs. All programs are open to all students. There will be supplemental programs offered after 
school for all students regardless of language. This program offers remedial and enrichment instruction to all students.    In 
addition, the district provides targeted programs for ELLs that is offered to all families of ENL students. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We currently have developing ELLs.  In order for our ELLs to recognize and optimize their full potential, the students are 
provided with in-depth language development activities. These activities are beneficial for those students who are 
encountering English for the first time and are having difficulty communicating. They will have access to intervention computer 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

programs such as Head Sprout and Imagine Learning English. The ESL Teacher will follow an ELL instructional model that is 
aligned to the five elements of reading as identified by the National Reading Panel; phonemic awareness, phonics/word study, 
vocabulary, comprehension, and fluency, and adds a crucial sixth element - oral language.  
 
We are currently using the Teachers College Reading & Writing Project units of study for teaching reading and writing. 
Activities for improving instruction and student performance in English Language Arts include the implementation of balanced 
literacy using a 120 minute literacy block schedule. Classroom libraries provide books that are on the instructional and 
independent reading level of students. Teachers conduct ongoing observations, conferences, running records, and 
assessments to monitor student progress. One goal is for students to move from teacher directed activities to more 
independent activities with support from the teacher. Classroom libraries, Fundations  will be used in classrooms to support 
spelling, phonics, decoding, vocabulary and word study. Independent reading and writing, shared reading and writing, 
interactive writing, read aloud, word study and guided reading are used daily by teachers to provide a balanced approach to 
reading and writing.  
 
We use the Engage NY Math curriculum which provides a supplement for scaffolding instruction for ELLs aligned to Common 
Core Standards and mathematical practices.  The supplement provides teachers with prototype lessons to emulate while 
teaching modeled on the AIR Scaffolding. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Only ENL model is offered.  Home language may be used to support the English language acquisition.  Home Language 
materials will be provided in leveled libraries in classrooms to the greatest extent possible. Reference books and dictionaries 
will also be provided in the home language. The home language is used to assist students’ understanding in the classroom.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Services are monitored through ESL provider attendance administrative observation of classroom teaching, and  student work 
products. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a location.  We coordinate efforts through our partnership with Teachers College Community School to 
ensure that students have opportunities to see their culture represented while in school to develop a strong socio emotional, 
academic, and linguistic component.  Students are exposed to a variety of enrichment that may involve opportunities to hear 
their native language.  Our PA is active in utilizing their funds of knowledge to provide students with rich cultural experiences. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled students and parents are interviewed by a trained pedagogue at the point of intake. After the interview, 
parents are provided with a list of activities to prepare students for the new school year. Parents are invited to a curriculum 
orientation and school tour. Students are invited to attend all supplemental and enrichment programs. These programs 
include classroom activities around themes which utilize community trips in helping develop language skills, as well as assisting 
the students to become acquainted with their neighborhood and local resources. Furthermore, parents as learning partners 
occurs each month, and invites families into classrooms. Family engagement time also occurs 2x each week and invites families 
to meet with classroom teachers. These options support family engagement throughout the school year.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

TCCS will offer Spanish electives in 7th grade.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

TCCS does not offer a dual language program.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Teacher training will be provided by consultants from Teachers College, the Instructional Coach, the Special Education Liaison, 
the ELL Specialist from the District or Borough Field Office and administrators in an ongoing effort to strengthen pedagogy for 
ELLs. All will work collaboratively to develop strategies to improve reading and writing proficiency using the workshop model. 
All staff members, including teachers of ELLs will attend professional development sessions focusing on ELLs to improve their 
teaching practices and develop strategies to work with ELLs. They will be invited to share their experiences and turn-key 
significant understandings. Teachers also attends calendar days at Teachers College that include strategies for ELLS. In 
accordance with CR Part-154, 15% of all teachers PD and 50% of ENL teachers PD will be ENL related. A calendar of PD dates is 
being organized by our instructional coach.    
Teachers will participate in the above training, which include a focus on CCLS. Teachers will also meet weekly during grade-
level common planning periods to ensure CCLS are effectively used to plan for instruction all students, including ELLs.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We currently only have elementary students.  However, in the future the ESL teacher and the guidance counselor will 
collaborate with classroom teachers to assist fifth graders in the middle school choice process.  
The training may include any and all of the following; DOE training, outside consultants, Borough Field Office providers. The 
workshops will include language methodology for teaching ELL’s, acquisition theory, and NYSESLAT preparation strategy. In 
addition, the ELL Specialist from the District or Borough will working closely with TCCS to provide ongoing support to all 
classroom teachers. He/she will offer professional development for all staff by highlighting best practices for ELLs.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
TCSS will offer a full range of parent workshops to assist parents in working with their children as well as to help them improve 
their literacy and math skills. Staff is available at all times for translation. The PA in collaboration with TCCS staff will plan 
activities to celebrate the various cultures represented in our school. Parents will also be invited to attend workshops from 
Teachers College as often as possible.  Weekly parent engagement time occurs two morning each week for a half hour at a 
time. Also, in accordance with CR Part 143,  one to one annual meetings to discuss acquisition and progress of ELLs will be 
held.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

#2 response (would not upload in space above) 
ENL teachers keep logs of contact with families. All family orientations or meetings have attendance sheets that are saved. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

Translation services are also noted if needed or requested by family. 
  
#3 
The Parent Coordinator and ELL or ENL Coordinator will collaborate  to design activities that foster involvement of families of 
ELLs. Currently, all activities are open to all families and therefore support families of ELLs participating in our inclusive school 
community. Parent Coordinator also secures translation services for all families as needed, in collaboration with ENL 
coordinator. Translation services in Spanish are available at school, and DOE Translation Support is used for all other 
languages.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Michelle Verdiner, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our demographics reveal a diverse student population though most parents are able to read, write and speak 
English. The languages spoken at home include: Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese and Wolof (an 
African Dialect). However, most parents prefer to converse in English with staff and students within the school 
setting. Results of our Learning Survey revealed that 91% of parents prefer emails and updates on the school 
website as a way to communicate with parents. The survey also revealed that 59% prefer communication by 
written notices sent home via student backpacks or telephone and 34% considered traditional mail an option for 
communication. Parent Surveys indicate a limited need for translation services. Most parents will speak their 
native language at home. However, conversing in English is their preference within the school setting.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Language  

As a result of our parent 
surveys, there is a limited 
need for translations 
services. Results were 
reported at PTA 
meetings, discussed at 
the School Leadership 
Team meetings and with 
staff during faculty 
meetings. Based on 
parental feedback during 
school visits, open 
houses, PTA meetings 
and other school 
activities; two of our 
parents require 
translation services in 
Spanish, in order to 
communicate with school 
staff. The rest are able to 
communicate in English.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to 

provide interpretation service(s)?  

 

 

Oral interpretation services are 
provided at the school. Our school has 
a number of bilingual staff members 
who are readily available to assist in 
our translation needs. The parent 
coordinator is also available during 
Open School night, parent meetings 
and other activities that may require 
translation services. We also offer 
language assistance services, if 
needed.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school will provide parents with language assistance services and instructions on how to obtain these services. 
The Notice for Parents regarding language Assistance Services (attachment A of the Chancellor’s Regulation A-663) is 
posted on the bulletin board near the main office. The School Safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that
