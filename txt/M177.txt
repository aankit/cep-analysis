Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

MS 177 prepares students to be critical thinkers, effective problem solvers, and powerful communicators in a rapidly 
changing 21 st century world. We engage students in an education that broadens their interests and deepens their 
understanding of the world around them in both the social and physical sciences. By embracing academic rigor, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

student voice, collaboration, self-direction, and empathy, our students will have the confidence, tenacity and skills for 
success. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
As we are in our fourth year, we are continuing to build the foundation for our school. Our 50% screened, 50% limited 
unscreened enrollment method has allowed us to have a diverse community of learners, both in terms of socio-
economic status and academic achievement. Our student population is 50% male and 50% female. We are 48% 
White, 27% Latino, 10% Asian, 10% African American, 1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and 4% other.  

We embrace a holistic approach to education, ensuring our students are supported academically, socially and 
emotionally. Students engage in collaborative group work in addition to individualized support during core academic 
classes, enrichment classes, and advisory periods. In order to best support all learners, we have emphasized an 
individualized approach to instruction in which teachers utilize flexible grouping, frequent formative assessments, 
station work, and differentiation so that all students are continuously challenged at their level. Our small learning 
community allows teachers to focus on knowing their children and to plan strategically for their students. In addition 
to the strategic planning and station work, we utilize within the core content areas, 3 days per week we offer an 
enrichment, extension, and intervention period called Cerebral Diversity. During this period, students engage in Math 
Counts (in which students tackle advanced mathematical material), Math Games (remediation and intervention 
supports through applied mathematics), Creative Writing, Research Seminar, Urban Planning, Debate, Latin American 
Cultural Studies, and a variety of other courses that change quarterly in response to our students’ needs and 
interests. 

 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Of our 232 students, 25% have IEPs. On the 2017-2018 NYS ELA Test, 57% of our students scored at or above grade 
level while 69% scored at or above grade level on the 2017-2018 NYS Math test. We are 1% English Language 
Learners. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During our first four years, we made significant progress in building and promoting teacher collaboration and a 
supportive learning environment for students. This was evidenced by the significant growth made by our 6th, 7th and 
8th graders making significant progress in both ELA and Math during the 2017-2018 school year. We will be focusing 
on strengthening our support of students through expanding our Restorative Practice work to include Tier I and Tier II 
work, and by deepening our notebook work across all content areas.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our NYS ELA scores have illustrated marked improvement by the majority of our students for the past 4 years, 
especially on constructed response questions. This is illustrated by the sharp decline in the number of students who 
scored a Level 1 on the NYS Test (from 12% to 4%), and an increase in students scoring a Level 4 (from 20% to 30%).  

This year, we are focusing on even greater improvement in reading in ELA across grade levels by ensuring a vertically 
aligned and differentiated curriculum that meets all of our students’ needs. Our focus includes utilizing the TC Reading 
Curriculum, emphasizing the use of notebooks across ELA, social studies and science, and using TC Reading 
Progressions to meet readers' needs and develop literary lives in all students.  
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, 80% of students will make 1.25 years of progress in reading comprehension as measured by Fountas and 
Pinnell Running Records.

students based on data from Fountas and Pinnell Running 
Records, including Book Clubs beginning at the KLM reading 
level. 

Students will conduct Student-Led Conferences to explain their 
current level to their parents and create a plan for improvement 
and growth based on reading progressions, notebook rubrics, 
and actionable feedback from teachers. Students will utilize 
teacher conference notes, self-assessment, and peer assessment 
to guide their SLCs. Parents will be notified of SLCs both during 
PTA meetings and via JupiterEd.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As Yorkville East has expanded over the past 4 years, we have hired an additional 12 additional staff members within 
2 years, allowing us to expand our teacher teams and departments. Our Quality Review indicated that, “Teacher 
teams conduct inquiry-based meetings to analyze assessment data related to student achievement, examine student 
work to surface learning gaps and discuss instructional strategies.” 

Strengths: 

· The analysis of data generated from Running Records assessment and the analysis of student writing using rubrics 
provides teacher teams with information about student comprehension, mastery of vocabulary and extended writing 
performance. Teachers then work together to ensure that reading strategies, vocabulary development and 
opportunities to write extended responses are employed throughout their units. 

· Scheduling of common planning time ensures teachers have time to meet and collaborate. They also review data, 
discuss student performance using performance rubrics and class assessments, and develop lesson plans to promote 
student outcomes. Teachers stated, “We eat lunch daily together to check in on student progress to ensure all 
students flourish”. 

· Teacher teams have created and refined student rubrics and checklists to assess student work. Teachers work 
collaboratively, before, during and after school and support each other with lesson planning and feedback. Lesson 
plans, unit plans and curriculum maps are in a common Drop Box and Google Docs folders, which allow for more 
regular feedback and streamlined communication among staff. 

Need:  

· Analysis of ongoing data collection for curricular revisions throughout the year 

· Training of new staff members in teacher team protocols and expectations 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, administration will support and guide all full-time staff members in taking on at least one leadership role 
within teacher teams as measured by Advance Scores in 4E.

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          30 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Yorkville East Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Yorkville East Middle School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;

The school’s Parent Involvement  
 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 
● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies 
as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical 
support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of 
the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming 
and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for 
parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support 
services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents 
of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be 
involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other 
applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We assess early literacy skills for our ELLs using the Renaissance Learning STARS Reading Assessment. This is done several 
times per year. This assessment indicates that one our ELL students is struggling with the development of phonics skills in 
English and that our other ELL student is approaching grade level in reading. This data will inform our instructional 
programming in a few ways including the techniques utilized during class time. Additionally, we will target vocabulary 
development by utilizing "Word Generation" in which students are explicitly taught conntent vocabulary embedded in context. 
During ESL pullout, our ESL instructor will focus on decoding and phonics skills with our Beginner ESL student and our ELA 
teacher will focus on comprehension during  
ELA with our Advanced ESL student. Our Advanced ESL student will be given grade level texts with scaffolds.  
Throughout the year, scaffolds will appropriately be removed.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teacher professional development, teacher teams 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We measure the success of our ELL students by utilizing Renaissance Learning Reading Assessments to measure their 
progress.  We also utilize the NYS ELA and Math results to analyze their progress and more carefully plan instruction to support 
their language acquisition.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We utilize a period called Cerebral Diversity for targeted intervention for all students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We do not have grades K-5.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Performance levels for our ELL students vary. We have 2 former ELLs who both passed the NYSESLAT last year. One of our ELLs 
is a long-term ELL with an IEP. He consistently fails the writing portion of the NYSESLAT but this is linked to his IEP classification 
of Speech and Language disability. He has been noted as a Level 6 because he is a long-term ELL who scored 1s or 2s on both 
the ELA & Math tests for the past several years. He is in the "high risk" category and an "advanced" ELL for the past 3 years. 
One of our current ELLs needs additional support in the writing component of the NYSESLAT. She is in a lower risk category and 
is noted as a Level 2 because she has only had one year of testing. If both students pass the written portion of the NYSESLAT 
this year, they will pass the exam. Each will need to answer 2-3 more questions correctly in order to pass. Both students have 
good attendance. 
   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teachers work in teams in order to break down the data and make instructional plans.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We use both push-in and pull-out instruction to support our ELLS. In 6  th   and 7  th   grades, our students are 
enrolled in a variety of 
general education classes. Students are pulled out for station work three times per week during class. This is part of 
our 
Freestanding ENL program. Teachers also utilize the SIOP model in order to support language acquisition and promote 
student 
understanding. Our ENL teacher also pushes into classrooms to support our ELL students. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

               The mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency level. In order to be in compliance 
with CR Part 
154, students at the Entering and Emerging stages receive standalone ENL 4 periods a week for 180 minutes and integrated 
ENL 4  
periods a week for an additional 180 minutes.  The students that are Transitioning and Expanding receive Integrated ENL 4 
periods a week for 180 minutes.  Students that are Commanding receive 2 periods a week for 90 minutes of instruction. The 
ENL teacher, along with classroom teachers and interventionists, work together to make sure there are no conflicts with the 
ENL schedule. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      At our school, we use the SIOP model to deliver ENL instruction. The content area instruction is delivered to allow multiple 
points of access to the content through text, visuals, scaffolded supports and talk. Rather than providing modified content, we 
enhance content. Students are exposed to concepts through multiple modalities. Students are provided with explicit 
instruction in how to develop an argument to support their ideas using text evidence. This protocol is repeated throughout the 
content areas to provide consistent strategies and repeated practice. The ENL teacher provides content area support in the 
ENL program by utilizing station work focused on a different content area each week. This allows students to build background 
understanding across content areas, further strengthening the acquisition of the subject matter. Throughout our content 
areas, ELLs are provided with language supports such as sentence starters and direct teacher feedback. Students also use 
native language support such as text in their native language, connection of content area vocabulary to native vocabulary, and 
conversations in native language to prepare to discuss in English. We use the SIOP model to deliver instruction. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

      We assess all native Spanish speakers by using the Spanish LAB when they enroll. Additionally, we allow students to 
complete tasks in their native language when appropriate. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. We do not have any SIFE students, therefore no SIFE model exists currently. However, if a SIFE student were to register, the 
student would be age-appropriately placed in a classroom. That student would be served individually to suit literacy needs 
using relevant scaffolding techniques. 
b. Newcomers utilize station work that emphasizes phonics, schema building, and comprehension. We provide pull-out 
services to our 
ELL students who have been in the U.S. for less than three years as well as text in their native lanauge and SIOP supports 
during 
classroom instuction. Our one newcomer student has tested at an advanced level. 
c. We do ntot have any developing ELL students but if we did, their instruction would include an emphasis on reading 
comprehension 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

and writing organization. Students would also receive testing accommodations on formal assessments and state tests. 
Examples of 
accommodations include the use of bilingual dictionaries and extended time. 
d. We have one long term ELL student who also receives in class supports.We differentiate instruction for all by providing  
him with special education and ELL supports and utilizing RTI approaches to address his academic needs in both ELA and 
Math.   
e. Our one former ELL student continues to receive services in a general education program and works with peers in order to 
clarify 
his confusion with idioms during class time. The ENL teacher works collaboratively with the classroom teachers to determine 
any 
areas of weakness and to help provide scaffolds that best support the student's needs. In addition, he continues to receive test 
accommodations when necessary, such as the use of a bilingual dictionary and extended time. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 The ENL teacher articulates with all service providers for those students and is aware of all necessary accommodations. The 
ENL 
teacher and the Special Education teachers and service providers meet regularly in order to discuss students' progress and to 
collaborate on scaffolds and supports for the student.  We also collaborate with the classroom teacher in order to plan 
appropriate 
instruction for students, based on their language level and IEP goals.  We also discuss tools and other strategies that can be 
used in 
the classroom in order to support students and ensure that they are understanding the material and able to perform 
classroom tasks 
independently. Some materials we have used to support students in this work include the Accelerated Reader online program 
and 
the Renaissance Learning online program.  These materials are determined grade and age-appropriate based on the skill that 
they 
target as well as students' interest in using the materials and ability to use them independently.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We use academic goal setting conferences and flexible scheduling. Cerebral Diversity time provides extra support so that 
students 
can be in the Least Restrictive Environment for the rest of the school day. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Regular formal assessments as well as informal observations and anecdotal notes are used in all content areas in order to 
determine the effectiveness of instruction and the intervention program for all students. Our interventions are provided in 
Math, ELA, Science, and Social Studies through differentiated instruction, after school extra help, advisory as well as during 
Cerebral Diversity, a period in which targeted interventions take place. During Cerebral Diversity our ELLs receive small group 
literacy and math based instruction. ELLs also utilize Word Generation to support vocabulary acquisition during morning 
advisory. STAR Mathematics program is offered through Renaissance Learning for mathematical support. In terms of classroom 
supports, ELLs are targeted for small group instruction in ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science based on teacher data. All 
teachers also employ SIOP strategies to support schema and content specific vocabulary. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are looking to increase the amount of small group and 1-on-1 services for our ELL population. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not plan on discontinuing any ELL programs or services at this time. We anticipate continuing to provide our 
Freestanding ENL program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students including ELLs have access to attend after school programs. Manhattan Youth provides our after school services 
and they offer a wide range of athletic, artistic, and academic programs. Some current after school programs are extra help, 
robotics, soccer, and art. Notices for upcoming programs are posted on our website which is translatable into other languages. 
ELLs also have access to all of our school enrichment programs when qualified such as Math Olympiads. Surveys and 
permission slips are provided to students in languages spoken at home. All ELL students are invited to attend and are given the 
opportunity to enroll in our after school programs.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We utilize smartboards  in all classrooms to provide visuals and models for students during instruction. We also utilize laptops 
to provide language based centers and support development of literacy skills as well as mathematics skills for all students. All 
students have access to Google Translate and visuals to support their comprehension of materials used.  We also use the 
Renaissance Learning online program for both ELA & Math. We use the Accelerated Reader online program. Translation 
services are utilized during research projects when necessary. Spanish classes are offered during the school day and during 
after school programs. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Test and dictionaries are available for all students in their native language in several content areas. Additionally, ELLs have 
access to laptops which provide a variety of options for supporting instruction in the native language in both content areas and 
Freestanding ENL classes.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We use the SIOP model to deliver instructionally appropriate grade level material to ELLs. We utilize a variety of level texts in 
order to ensure equity of access to all of our students including our ELLs. These texts ensure students can master the materials 
and our reading with frequency to ensure their growth. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We utilize smartboards  in all classrooms to provide visuals and models for students during instruction. We also utilize laptops 
to provide language based centers and support development of literacy skills as well as mathematics skills for all students. All 
students have access to Google Translate and visuals to support their comprehension of materials used.  We also use the 
Renaissance Learning online program for both ELA & Math. We use the Accelerated Reader online program. Translation 
services are utilized during research projects when necessary. Spanish classes are offered during the school day and during 
after school programs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our ENL teacher, Alana Gerstein, offers newly enrolled ELL students with school tours to help them get acquainted with our 
school building and important places to know. In addition, our school secretary, Iris Morales, is available to speak to both 
students and parents in Spanish. Two of our teachers, Ashley Gallegos and Eileen Llinas are available to help ELL students 
transition into our school. We also partner students in a "buddy system" to support their transition into the new school 
community. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

We currently offer Spanish. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Yorkville East Middle School utilizes the Workshop Model for instruction and these modalities are brought directly to ENL 
instruction. Lessons begin with an explanation of the purpose of the day's lesson followed by a mini lesson. Students are able 
to observe the teacher as a model, practice the skill independently then with pairs or small groups, leading to whole group 
discussion and share out. Instruction also includes shared reading, read alouds, independent reading, journaling, writers' and 
readers' notebooks. modeling and countless opportunities to view model reading and writing. All teachers receive multiple 
professional development opportunties during our Tuesday (80 minutes) and Wednesday (75 minutes) morning professional 
development sessions.  Our ENL teacher receives an email newsletter from the Office of English Language Learners that lists PD 
opportunities for ELL educators in the region and attends the sessions that seem most appropriate and beneficial. She 
communicates any information gained to staff in order to ensure that necessary steps are taken to follow compliance 
regulations. She also meets with colleagues, including other ENL teachers in District 2, for a monthly peer consultation group. 
This group regularly discusses changes to compliance regulations, various teaching methodology, and testing information. We 
also discuss any workshops and conventions that we have attended in an attempt to support each other with new instructional 
techniques and ELL compliance information. Records are maintained in a Professional Development folder in our school's main 
office.    
Professional development focuses on differentation strategies including ELL specific strategies utilized in the SIOP model. This 
structure ensure that all students are able to access a Common Core aligned curriculum. In addition, we work with the ENL 
teacher of PS 158, Alana Gerstein, who receives professional development through the Office of ELLs as well as through 
Columbia University's Teachers College at PS 158. As we are also using the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project 
curriculum, Alana has access to the same strategies and approaches we utilize within our classroom.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
To assist ELLS as they transition from elementary school to middle school, we offer small class sizes, homeroom, and weekly 
advisory. During this time, all of our students are supported in terms of organization, creating academic goals, and vocabulary 
development. In addition, during weekly advisory, all students are engaged in lessons to support the acquisition of positive 
social skills, study skills, bullying, and what to expect during middle school. Our guidance counselor assists teachers in writing 
the advisory curriculum and special attention is placed on helping students transition to middle school. Next year, when we 
graduate our first 8  th   grade class, the guidance counselor will work with any ESL students and their families. as they prepare 
to transition to high school. 
As prescribed by CR Part 80, 15% of the required professional development hours are dedicated to language acquisition 
focusing  
on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instructions for ELLs. At our school, we focus 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

on    
ensuring all teachers are proficient in the SIOP model. For our ENL teacher, 50% of her required professional development 
hours  
are dedicated to language acquisition and alignment with core content area instruction, best practices for co-teaching 
strategies  
and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. Records and agendas for all professional development activities are 
kept  
in a binder by the principal.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We add an additional meeting at the beginning and end of the year in which we discuss the goals and current levels of 
achievement of the student. At this conference we present SMART goals based on the data collected in each of the 4 
modalities to the parents. When necessary, translation services are provided either by an in house staff member or by hiring 
an outside contracted vendor. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
The parents of our ELLs participate in our school potluck at the beginning of the year, are invited to monthly parent workshops, 
attend student led parent teacher conferences, and attend PTA events. Translation services are provided when necessary. We 
currently do not have a parent coordinator at our school.  
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Currently we only have 2 ELLs and one former ELL in our school. We work with PS 158, our co-locating school, to ensure adequate 
ENL services are provided to our students.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christina Riggio, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting.

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The methods with which we assess our language preferences include gathering data and information included on 
our Home Language Surveys, new student registrations, ATS reports, student records (including emergency 
contact cards and reports on ATS that include home language information), meetings with parents, and 
information offered by our ENL teacher, Ms. Gerstein. Our school secretary, Iris Morales, maintains a spreadsheet 
with all of this information and updates it as necessary. The majority of our translation needs continue to revolve 
around Spanish translation and interpretation services. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
