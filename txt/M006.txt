Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

PS 6 is invested in the success of all students as individuals: academically, socially, emotionally and creatively. We 
believe successful education must include a partnership between home and school. Staff members, students and 
parents work together to achieve academic and personal growth. By inviting parents into our classrooms as well as 
offering a multitude of parent information sessions, we are giving our families an education about their children’s 
education. The school holds high academic standards for all students, believing that the best instruction comes from 
good modeling on two levels. First, teachers use their own writing and reading process and their own mathematical 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

thinking to model specific strategies for students. In addition, the teachers demonstrate continued learning by 
furthering their own practices, modeling the importance of being lifelong learners.  
It is also our mission to develop the cultural literacy of our students. PS 6 is located a block east of Central Park and a 
“stone’s throw” from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Cultural literacy is literally at our door, and is a big part of our 
students’ school experience. Whether it is third graders enhancing their study of African culture by exploring African 
Masks at the Met, second graders visiting the Museum of the City of New York to gain an historical perspective of our 
great city, fifth graders taking part in a collaboration with the Guggenheim through an after school CASA program, or 
kindergarteners adopting a tree in Central Park to study across the seasons, we are committed to our students’ 
understanding that learning takes place both inside and outside our doors. Our student body represents the cultural 
diversity of New York with families representing cultures from across the globe. When students leave PS 6 they leave 
with an understanding of the richness a diverse community brings to their lives. 

  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 6 is a nationally recognized leader in public education that holds all students to high learning standards. 
Investigative-based curriculum, interdisciplinary teaching and a highly motivated faculty serve as the foundation for 
identifying, developing and promoting successful strategies that meet the individual educational and emotional needs 
of each PS 6 student. The needs of a diverse body of learners are met with programs such as Integrated Co-teaching, 
intervention and small group instruction. 
PS 6 is a school that strives for a balance between process oriented instruction and the skills and strategies good 
educators have always valued. Teachers teach programs that are an outgrowth of their staff development and their 
own collaborative process across and within grades.  
PS 6 staff are interested in the success of all students as individuals – academically, socially and creatively. To that 
end, PS 6 has a comprehensive art, music and dance program that taps into a multi-talented student body. The school 
values character education – training staff members, students and parents in social emotional educations. PS 6 is 
committed to providing a balance between academic achievement and personal growth. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Every grade has an ICT class with a general education and special education teacher. Up to 40% of the students have 
special needs, including learning disabilities, speech and language impairments, and other health impairments. The 
students are supported by a staff of specialists including speech, occupational, art, and physical therapists. Our 
guidance counselor and SBS team work closely with teachers and related service providers to insure students’ social 
and emotional needs are met. In addition, every general education classroom also has students with IEPs who are 
supported by key personnel. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide Survey, PS 6 received a strong Rigorous Instruction Score of 4.65. In the 2017-
2018 CEP we made strengthening the math curriculum a priority. We used the structure of Math Centers to allow 
teachers to differentiate instruction, as well as spiral back to content previously taught. The centers focused on all 
aspects of the current math curriculum, including problem solving, as well as developing flexibility and accuracy in 
computation. This has allowed for a more dynamic learning environment and more opportunities for differentiation 
and reinforcement of material.  

While this initiative is off to a good start, it has brought to light the need for review of Investigations (TERC), our 
current math curriculum; specifically how the curriculum challenges students at all levels. This year several programs 
were investigated and next year we will be complimenting the Investigations Curriculum with elements of Math in the 
City, Engage NY, and Singapore Math. The success of this goal will lead to a smoother transition from grade to grade, 
preparing students for higher level 
mathematical thinking at all grade levels. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
To better prepare students for the significant increase in problem-solving complexity required by the standards, we will 
use a range of mathematics curricula that will increase the depth of mathematical thinking and conversations of 
mathematical 
strategies. Teachers in grades Kindergarten to 4 will revise at least 2 units of study using elements drawn from a variety 
of curricula, such as Math in the City, Engage NY, and Singapore Math -one in the first semester, and one in the second 
semester. Teachers will meet within their grade groups to share and evaluate student work product.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
The math curriculum will be introduced to parents by classroom teachers during the September Curriculum Night 
2018, and Jane Galasso and classroom teachers during the October Math Morning 2018. Math Parents as Learning 
Parents will be held later in the year, where parents participate in the classroom with their children in a math lesson 
highlighting higher level mathematical thinking. Classroom teachers and Jane Galasso will compose notes from each 
meeting that will be shared with families. We will explore establishing additional parent workshops to help support 
and educate parents about the curriculum.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 
In the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide Survey, PS 6 received a Supportive Environment score of 3.79, which meets 
but does not exceed expectations. We believe the Responsive Classroom program, implemented in 2017-2018 as 
described in last year's CEP, has the potential to create a more supportive environment by providing teachers with 
strategies to build intrinsic motivation within students, allowing them to participate in positive ways as members of a 
larger community. Responsive Classroom will also give teachers and students a shared language to communicate 
expectations within and across grades and across the entire school, creating and sustaining a school environment that 
maximizes academic and social behavior outcomes.  

In addition, the school has adopted the Positive Behavior matrix from PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and 
Supports). Using the school motto Be Kind, Be Safe, Be Responsible, students discussed what this would look across 
our school - in the yard, cafeteria, classroom, hallways, bathrooms, etc. Based on the work with the matrix this year, 
we need to continue making these words … BE KIND, BE SAFE, BE RESPONSIBLE… the message of our school.  

 
   
 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Teachers will continue to deepen their understanding of Responsive Classroom during the 2017-2018 school year. 
Teachers will continue to develop a repertoire of non-punitive strategies and logical consequences for teaching 
students positive behaviors.  

We expect to see improved student social and emotional behavior that will be measured using two sources of data: 

  OORS reports will be evaluated two times throughout the year - late fall and late spring. 
  The End of Year Data Report from two grades will be used to track a sampling of students over three school 

years (2016-2017, 2017-2018, 2018-2019) to determine the effectiveness of Responsive Classroom. 

We expect the # of OORS reports will decrease by 25% from the late fall t late spring analysis. 

We expect there will be a 25 % decrease in students receiving behavior grades below a level 3.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

PS 6 is a collaborative school. Teachers meet weekly to share and create curricula, to look at student work, and to 
discuss questions they have about any facet of their work. Over the past 2 years the staff has begun to create shared 
documents on Google Drive, so that our collaborative efforts are memorialized in documents easily accessible. This 
effort has also supported teachers new to the staff, as they have documents to look at to support their own teaching.  

Based on a new teacher survey, it was determined new teachers need additional support that collaborating on shared 
documents did not provide. Classroom management, parent communication, and expanding content knowledge are a 
few of the areas new teachers felt they needed more support in. Our goal for the 2018-2019 school year is to provide 
ongoing support for new teachers that cover the wide range of areas and topics our new teacher survey brought to 
light.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 

New teachers (those with 3 years experience of less) will meet with a mentor to focus on 3 main areas: 

  management 
  parent communication 
instructional knowledge 
 

 

There will be 3 cycles of professional development, one for each area, that will be planned around the above topics. A 
mentor will work with the new teacher to make a plan for improvement in each area. At the end of each cycle the 
teacher and mentor will evaluate the effectiveness of the professional development. A teacher survey will be conducted 
at the end of the year to determine the effectiveness of this initiative. Mentors and mentees will meet at the end of

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

An anonymous survey was conducted of teachers whose first 
year of full time teaching at PS 6 occurred in 2015-2016 or later. 
Of the ten teachers in this group, seven completed the survey. 
The teachers were asked to rate their new teacher experience 
and to identify their biggest challenges, the supports they 
received that were most and least helpful and possibilities for 
improvement. (See attached summary) 

Based on the survey, teachers in their first three years will have 
monthly meetings. These meetings will be led by mentor 
teachers and address common issues:  

parent communication; 

management instructional and content knowledge

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The school administration is extremely involved in curriculum and instruction, working with staff to support 
curriculum development across all grades. Teachers are supported with materials, professional development, and in 
house mentoring opportunities so that they can grow as pedagogues.  

While teachers feel supported in their instruction, there exists no central forum for administrators, teachers and 
parents to evaluate, refine and implement new tactical ideas. Having a committee to brainstorm ideas and bring them 
to fruition will ensure that once ideas have been vetted and implemented, they could be adequately maintained from 
year to year. Having this committee would facilitate decisions being made and communicated to all community 
members in a timely manner. We believe that establishing a Steering Committee would increase our 2016-2017 
Effective School Leadership score from 3.25 and our Trust score from 3.14.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

The school has created a Steering Committee to oversee identification and implementation of tactical improvements in 
the school. The members of the Steering Committee will form subcommittees of interested staff and parents to follow 
through with initiatives. In January 2019, the committee will produce a summary of initiatives it has considered, 
implemented and overseen that will be used to judge the effectiveness of the concept. Ideas for improvement will come 
from a variety of sources, including the members of the steering committee, the administration, the PS 6 staff, and 
parents. An initial survey was sent out in spring of 2018, asking teachers for their input as to the initiatives they wanted 
to pursue. The results of this survey will be used to begin the work of the committee in the 2018-2019 school year.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Establish a Steering Committee of teachers and administrators 
that would meet on a regular basis to serve as a forum for 
gathering, evaluating and implementing tactical improvements 
throughout the school. The committee would form 
subcommittees that include parent members to follow through 
on initiatives. 

The Steering Committee will be responsible for establishing 
benchmarks for evaluating and refining the programs it oversees, 
and including those benchmarks and evaluations in its annual 
summary 

The Steering Committee will report to the SLT on its activities and 
subcommittees. The Steering Committee and SLT will work 
together where Steering Committee initiatives overlap with the 
SLT mandate.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

PS 6 provides many opportunities to build strong family and community ties, as reflected in our score of 4.57 on the 
Framework for Great Schools survey. Parent information sessions and workshops are offered across the year in a 
variety of areas. These include a meet and greet hour for families to visit their new classrooms before the first day of 
school, math and literacy mornings, ELA and Math testing information sessions, kindergarten homework sessions, and 
more. We hold an evening social in the fall, a World’s Fair in the spring, and various other opportunities for families to 
get to know each other.  

Throughout the year, teachers also send home information pertaining to grade specific initiatives and programs their 
children will be involved in. These include curriculum information, special events, trips, etc. Although this information 
is sent home, based on parent feedback, some parents feel there is too much to read. Therefore, we need to explore 
what information needs to be sent home, as well as an alternative forum to share information.  

This year our goal is to improve upon the ongoing communication with parents, using SchoolCNXT, a mobile 
application. We believe this method of communication will be engaging, and provide an effective forum to 
communicate a wide range of information.  

 

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
PS 6 staff will use SchoolCNXT to communicate a wide range of information to families. All teachers will use SchoolCNXT 
a minimum of 2 times in the fall, and 2 times in the spring.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Lillie D. Blake, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Lillie D. Blake will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress;

improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the "Every Student Succeeds Act" (ESSA) 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Lillie D. Blake, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I,

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The New York City performance assessment to assess ELA literacy skills in used.  PS 6 uses the TCRWP to assess all students 
throughout the year to check in with the literacy skill levels. We use TC running records and the TCRWP assessments. In 
alignment with the TC curriculum, teachers use pre and post writing assessments as part of the ELA curriculum. We use these 
assessments to guide our instructional planning for ELLs in order to properly place them into groups that focus on skills needed 
at their level. Examples of these groups included guided reading and guided writing groups. In these guided groups, the ELL 
teacher and classroom teacher are able to directly address the reading and writing needs of ELL students that are identified by 
the formative assessments. By planning for this guided reading and writing time with ELLs, the ELL teacher and classroom 
teacher and better able to address the needs of ELLs in the school.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Once data is collected from TCRWP assessments, teachers are able to share the results with the ELL teacher and 
administration both through face-to-face interactions and a shared document that monitors progress. Disseminating this data 
found through formative assessments allows us to inform our instructional planning in a number of ways. The primary 
structure put into place in the classroom is guided reading groups based on the reading levels and needs of students. Students 
are provided with texts that are individualized for their reading level and teachers target their instruction to address the 
reading skills needed to move on to more advanced levels. For example, students who struggle to retell stories in the reading 
assessments receive scaffolded instruction that pushes retelling language and different strategies to retell stories. The ELL 
teacher and classroom teacher use the data collected from running records to collaborate on appropriate pedagogical 
strategies to support the content and linguistic needs of the child. We want to make sure the child is making gains toward their 
reading MOSL goal. We also use the classroom teachers' other literacy assessments, such as pre- and post-writing 
assessments to monitor how an ELL progresses in English proficiency. To provide additional support with the scope and 
sequence, the classroom teacher and ENL teacher meet to collaboratively plan to differentiate the curriculum so that it 
accessible and engaging for the student. The ELL teacher has access through a Google Drive to all of the curriculum content for 
all grades so that she can better anticipate the needs of the ELLs and help teachers implement scaffolds to support the 
children during class time.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
School leadership and teachers may use the results of the ELL Periodic Assessments, NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, and other language 
based assessments to identify ELLs’ areas of need and monitor progress.  These assessments help provide our teachers and 
staff with detailed information about our students’ strengths and weaknesses in English language development. First, the ELL 
teacher can access students’ NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores through ATS to determine the breakdown of test results.  The 
results provide information on the students’ performance in the four modalities (listening, speaking, reading writing). By 
analyzing the “Exam History Report,” we can also see patterns of individual student performance.  This is very helpful when it 
comes time to group the classes and also to see what areas need improvement. For example, students who scored lower in 
the writing modality will be placed into a group that leans heavier on writing structure and development.  Furthermore, the 
ELL teacher uses periodic assessments to assess language growth in the four modalities throughout the year. These 
assessments are kept in the child’s file for the year to monitor progress and determine what types of scaffolds will help the 
child in the classroom.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

By looking at student data over several years, such as NYSESLAT scores for individual students, we are able to determine 
where our students are making progress in their English proficiency and where they need more support. These assessments, 
along with the summative baseline and mid-line assessments completed by the ELL teacher, provide information on the 
students’ performance in the four modalities. This information in turn serves as a resource to help the ELL and classroom 
teachers better plan for lessons.  By seeing where specific strengths and weaknesses fall, we are not only better able to group 
students, but we can also focus on problem areas and lean less on the areas they excel in.  This is not to say a student who 
scores high on reading will not read during small group instruction, but rather that writing will be an instructional focus for the 
teacher.  Furthermore, we use the results of these assessments to implement specific interventions for ELLs prior to 
the NYS exams.  To provide additional help with scope and sequence, the classroom teacher and ELL teacher plan 
collaboratively to differentiate the curriculum based on linguistic needs so that it is accessible and engaging for the student. 
The school is learning a lot of information about ELLs from all assessments performed.  As previously stated, we can see where 
certain students are falling behind, and we can see where they are excelling.  These summative assessments give us an idea of 
what each student is capable of.  This data helps all teachers to plan and create different lessons with appropriate amounts of 
differentiation and scaffolding to help the ELL population be successful.    
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
With the multiple means of data that we are able to collect from the EDAT, tests including the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and other 
assessments such as running records and baseline assessments, we are able to identify which English Language Learners need 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

additional language support and in which areas this support is needed.  As is aligned with the RtI framework, teachers are able 
to determine whether or not students are benefiting from the instructional program within a reasonable time frame. Teachers 
are then able to build more targeted instructional programs for students who are not benefiting, as they will be able to see in 
what specific areas the child needs additional support. This approach to RtI will also help the ELL teacher design more effective 
individualized plans for different students that is tailored to their individual needs.  Also, the classroom teacher and ELL 
teacher collaboratively assess the student and compare notes and observations to provide a clearer and holistic picture of the 
student.  With the additional information and attention to detail, there will be a greater potential for effective instructional 
techniques to support academically at-risk ELLs.  If the classroom teacher and the ELL teacher agree there is need for further 
evaluation for a student who is not performing or growing as expected, additional interventions will take place, starting with 
in-class interventions and then outside support from a specialist if necessary. Along with the RtI framework, teachers take into 
account how long the child has been speaking English and the level of literacy the child has in the first language. 
The PPT committee, which includes administrators, SETTS teachers, and related service providers, helps to monitor students 
who receive additional at-risk support to see what progress the student makes and how to best support the child. If the ELL 
still does not make the expected progress, the PPT committee may suggest a bilingual evaluation if the ELL is suspected of 
having a disability.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use several end of year assessments, such as the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math tests, to evaluate and inform our ENL program. 
By looking at the NYSESLAT results over the course of several years using the RLAT and EDAT reports, certain information is 
revealed by the data patterns across proficiency levels and grades. Our Kindergarten ELLs represent all proficiency levels. 
Students who had been at the school for more than a year were exclusively transitioning or expanding. Typically, 
the NYSITELL shows that newly registered students in upper grades are entering or emerging levels.  There is a gradual 
increase in proficiency from emerging to expanding students across all grades. We noted our ELLs tend to perform stronger in 
the state Math tests. We used this information along with the ELA and Math scores to inform how to best support this student 
with test taking and comprehension strategies, particularly to support work geared for the ELA. We also look at which teachers 
predominately work with the ELL population in the school and the trends the students have in their English proficiency growth. 
The ELL teacher works with these teachers in particular to help scaffold the curriculum to address the English proficiency 
needs of the ELLs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ELL program continues to make ongoing adjustments based on the findings from outcome assessments. In conjunction 
with the administration and classroom teachers, the ELL teacher is predominantly responsible for implementing these 
adjustments. As previously mentioned they happen on an ongoing basis, but any significant changes to the ELL program 
curriculum happen on an annual basis. As an example, when looking at the NYSESLAT scores from last year on the RLAT report, 
we noticed the weakest areas for the ELL students was listening, which revealed that the ENL curriculum will incorporate a 
program targeted specifically towards building listening stamina and comprehension skills.  The strongest areas were the 
speaking and reading sections, which shows that students are able to communicate and understand English input when they 
are given the passage to read. We disseminate these findings through several facets, including one on one meetings with 
teachers, curriculum planning days and professional development time. Our goal is to ensure all staff working with ELLs are 
able to understand the needs of our ELL population and make appropriate adjustments to meet these needs.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At PS 6 we align our ELL program with the comprehensive core curriculum. The ELL teacher, the principal and other 
staff members are continuously working to develop a schedule for ELL students in each grade and proficiency level 
that is compliant with the CR Part 154 regulations. The ENL teacher works collaboratively with classroom teachers to 
ensure the students are getting the most out of their small groups during both standalone and integrated ENL.   
For integrated ENL, the ENL teacher pushes into the classroom for the mandated number of minutes. The classroom 
and ENL teachers work together to identify best practices for teaching methods, instructional decisions and texts that 
tie into a thematic unit that the class is studying.  The standalone ENL program is provided through a “pull-out” model 
for students who are entering and emerging. The program model that we have at PS 6 is a mix of heterogeneous 
and homogeneous students.  We group by skill level as well as grade level.  For example if there is a 4th grader whose 
proficiency level is lower than that of the other 4th graders but the same as the 3rd graders, that student would be 
placed with the 3rd grade group. Our goal is to find the right balance for our ELLs with regards to their second 
language development and age appropriate content.    
    The ELL program is built around the four essential skills students must acquire: listening, speaking, reading and 
writing.  The ENL instruction is content-based in both the standalone and integrated models. The content, materials 
and lessons are adapted to meet each student’s needs and provide scaffolding for language. The ELL teacher utilizes 
differentiated teaching methods to ensure the success of each individual student at his or her level.  There is a strong 
emphasis on literacy work, following a balanced language approach in the workshop model. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We do not have this program. Not applicable to PS 6  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We do not have this program. Not applicable to PS 6   

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Students are served with the mandated number of minutes according to proficiency level in the ENL model.  The transitioning 
and expanding students are served with 4 periods of 45 minutes of ENL per week for a total of 180 minutes per week.  The 
entering and emerging levels have 8 periods, or 360 minutes, a week. Entering, emerging, and transitioning students receive 
an equal distribution of time in a standalone model and an integrated model of ENL. The focus for expanding students is 
exclusively in the integrated model, as per the mandated services set forth by CR Part 154. The ELL teacher 
shares NYSESLAT data with classroom teachers to ensure that all ELLs are receiving the mandated number of ENL minutes.   
  a. ENL instruction is given to the students on two levels. On the entering and emerging levels, PS 6 provides 360 minutes of 
explicit instruction per week.  This is completed with 180 minutes of integrated ENL and 180 minutes of standalone ENL in the 
pull out model. On the transitioning and expanding levels, explicit instruction is provided 180 minutes per week.  For 
transitioning students, 90 minutes is provided in the integrated model and the other 90 minutes may be provided either in the 
standalone or integrated model based on the student’s need. For expanding students, the 180 minutes is provided in the 
integrated model. These ENL instructional minutes are complemented by a minimum of 400 minutes of explicit ELA reading 
and writing instruction provided in the regular classrooms. We provide HLA instructional minutes through the use of bilingual 
books in the class libraries, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, and by allowing students who speak the same home language 
to translate for one another. Additionally, many classrooms invite ELLs to label parts of the room in their home language. 
Some classes invite parents in for special presentations that share part of the culture. We do not have direct HL instruction in 
our school since we only provide an ENL curriculum.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

We only offer an ENL program model. In that model the ELA, math, social studies, science and ENL content delivered is a 
mixture of heterogeneous and homogeneous levels, based on both the grade and proficiency level of the student. Provided 
entirely in English, this content is complemented by the balanced literacy model, which is aligned with the Common Core 
Learning Standards. Each of the content areas is made comprehensible by differentiating instruction for each of our students, 
providing different levels of scaffolding based on language proficiency and literacy instruction in the content areas. A variety of 
resources are utilized, such as native language books, content area books and manipulatives to support the comprehensible 
input provided to ELL students. The ENL teacher works with classroom teachers to streamline the work and help ELL students 
foster their language development while accessing the grade level content. The ENL teacher also helps classroom teachers 
modify and scaffold instructional approaches and methods to make content comprehensible while still addressing the 
demands of NYS Learning Standards. Some examples of these modifications include content area vocabulary webs, picture 
webs, and wordless books or movies. To provide this targeted content and language instruction, the classroom and ELL 
teachers use both small and large group instruction. For expanding ELLs in upper grades, we focus on using expanded English 
language to address standards that focus on inferencing skills and creating connections between texts. For entering, emerging 
and transitioning ELLs, there is inferencing work but also a lot of focus on key detail standards to help build basic English 
vocabulary to talk about reading and writing. In order to address math standards, the ELL teacher works with classroom 
teachers to help build the essential vocabulary that is needed to describe and compare attributes and work through word 
problems.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We constantly seek to find ways to assess our ELLs in their home language throughout the year. At this time, we haven’t found 
an appropriate way to assess students, as we have several low incidence languages. However, we use translators or school 
personnel to assist with evaluations.  If we are referring an ELL student to have related services such as SETTS or speech, we 
request a bilingual evaluation for the student.  If any of the standardized tests are available in a student's native language, we 
make sure to make that language an option for the student. If a translated version is not available, we hire a translator for the 
standardized tests that mandate native language assistance (NYS Math and Science exams). If any further investigation in the 
home or native language is needed, we have a translator come in to assist with whatever information we are trying to collect. 
Students are also provided opportunities to access information in their native language through books and certain online 
resources such as Raz-Kids. We also use peers of their native language to help engage newer ELLs with the curriculum.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction and intervention within the ELL subgroups is differentiated, depending on the fluency levels of the students.  We 
try to pair the students with similar fluency peers, but this is not always the case.  In some cases, we may provide one student 
with enriched text, and another student with a controlled text in the reading section.  Other times worksheets may be 
adjusted according to skill level.   
 
  a. PS 6 does not currently have any SIFE students, which indicates there is currently no program model in effect for those 
students.  If we were to receive a SIFE student, we would provide the student with the oral questionnaire, the Multilingual 
Literacy SIFE screener and a written screener. If these tools indicated the newly enrolled ELL is a SIFE, we would place the 
student in an appropriate age classroom and have them in the group that best suits their needs.  Appropriate scaffolding 
techniques would be applied that would differentiate the curriculum in an accessible way. We would also provide small group 
instruction in order to ensure the student solidifies the academic foundation needed to ground the more advanced academic 
work being done in the classroom. 
 
  b. Our plan for newcomer ELLs in the US less than 3 years involves a lot of vocabulary-based lessons, as well as grammatically-
enriched lessons.  With the newcomers, generally the vocabulary range is our strongest focus, paired with picture books. With 
the transitioning and expanding newcomers, we usually work on sentence syntax and the grammar rules, as well as reading 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

comprehension. We support these learners in a variety of content areas, including social studies and mathematics, scaffolding 
their learning through previewing, explaining concepts and ideas to peers and teachers, as well as manipulatives and other 
hands-on materials. 
 
 c.  At this time, PS 6 does not have any developing ELLs. In the event we have developing ELLs that have been in the US for 4-6 
years, the lessons would look different than the ones for newcomers.  These ELLs would work mostly on reading and reading 
comprehension as well as essay writing and general writing and editing. We would support these learners in a variety of 
content areas, including social studies and mathematics, scaffolding their learning through previewing, explaining concepts 
and ideas to peers and teachers, as well as manipulatives and other hands-on materials. 
 
  d. At PS 6 we do not currently have any students who have been here for over 6 years, so there is no program in 
place.  However if we did have such students, the program would be based upon an intensive study created using 
the NYSESLAT score reflecting areas of weakness.  If one student keeps getting low scores in writing, the ENL and classroom 
teacher would focus on writing strategies that foster language development for this student. For ELLs who have special needs, 
lessons are tailored according to the student's specific needs and the goals of the IEP.   
 
 e. The ELL students who have exited the ENL program within the last 2 years receive additional support from the ENL teacher. 
As mandated by the regulations in CR Part 154, the ENL teacher provides 90 minutes of services using the integrated ENL 
model. Depending on how the student exited the ELL program, the ENL teacher chooses how to focus instructional efforts. For 
students who exited ELL status by achieving a commanding score on the NYSESLAT, the ENL teacher will provide integrated 
services in the content area in which the student needs the most support. The ENL teacher will consult and collaborate with 
the classroom teacher in order to look at data to determine which academic area needs the most support. As an example, if 
support is needed in writing, the ELL teacher will differentiate classroom instruction to provide graphic organizers and shared 
writing lessons to scaffold instruction for the former ELL. For students who exited ELL status by achieving a 3 on the ELA test 
and an expanding score on the NYSESLAT, the ENL teacher will provide support in the language modality that was the weakest 
for the student on the NYSESLAT, as well as support in math.These former ELLs are also provided with ELL testing modifications 
as deemed necessary, including extended time and separate location on all standardized state tests, as well as the opportunity 
to use a bilingual dictionary if needed. The ENL teacher and the classroom teachers have an ongoing dialogue throughout the 
year to monitor students’ progress and testing needs.  
Former ELLs at times need to be screened further to determine whether or not they have special needs, like help in reading or 
math, outside of being former ELLs.  The math coach will assess students who are struggling with the math concepts, and the 
reading and literacy coaches will assess ELLs and former ELLs to determine if they should be receiving additional services in 
these areas as well as ENL. If they are deemed eligible by the interventionists, then they will have at-risk services to serve their 
needs in either, or in some cases both areas. The ELL teacher always works with the current teacher of her former ELL to 
discuss possible at-risk services. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We collaboratively use instructional strategies and grade level materials for ELL-SWDs to provide access to academic content 
areas and accelerate English language development.  The ELL teacher works with classroom teachers to ensure appropriate 
and relevant context related texts are used in the classroom. Depending on the study, the ELL teacher picks out texts that 
showcases the academic content, but in a way that scaffolds for comprehension and language proficiency. The ELL teacher also 
provides an account on Raz-Kids that scaffolds reading instruction to the student's individual reading level. This technology is 
an excellent resource for our ELL population that provides access to content, while building on language skills in an interactive 
and engaging way.    
 
Our classroom teachers preview and review any new vocabulary so that ELL-SWDs are able to access the lesson. The students 
are given word banks during read aloud, social studies and math lessons in order to know what words to listen for as they 
attend to the lesson. The teachers have students read aloud short texts in partnerships and stop at parts to talk about the 
information. Classes have a word study period in which the ELLs, including ELL-SWDs, receive targeted instruction on letter-
sound recognition, spelling rules and patterns to support their encoding and decoding.  ELL-SWDs have access to grade level 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

materials: the students are given math materials according to their grade and the materials are modified if necessary, the 
students have a read aloud period and the text read is leveled for their grade and students use mentor texts from authors or 
their peers to understand what a grade level writing piece looks like.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least 
restrictive environment.  Teachers group students according to age, proficiency level and areas of need. The goal is always to 
provide students with the instruction they need in order to accelerate their English language development in tandem with 
meeting the goals of the IEP. Therefore, the ELL teacher works with clinicians, classroom teacher and SETTS teachers to help 
create language goals that support the academic work to meet the IEP goals. ALL ELL-SWDs are benefiting from targeted work, 
such as reading reform, to help meet their academic needs while continuing to build knowledge of English vocabulary and 
letter work. 
 
The teachers use curricular flexibility by modifying lessons to meet the needs of the ELL-SWDs according to their goals. They 
break down larger strategies into specific steps so that the students are able to process what they are being asked to do within 
the larger strategy. The students have the opportunity to read texts at their independent reading level, they are given math 
materials based on their goals and the students write along a continuum therefore they work on the skills they need in order 
to move up the continuum. The curriculum allows for discussion across subject areas. The students’ partners vary; at times 
students are with children who are at their proficiency level and at other times students have the opportunity to discuss their 
ideas with children of varying abilities. 
 
The teacher's instruction is flexible based on the students’ needs. Therefore, students are broken up into small groups to 
receive instruction based on their goals. Teachers look at the student's’ work based alongside the standards and a reading and 
writing continuum to outline the skills a student needs support in and then creates a small group based on those skills. In 
math, students are broken up into groups to receive targeting instruction in an area of need. 
 
The schedule is flexible throughout the school. Teachers work with service providers to create a schedule to meet with the 
service provider to plan and also to agree upon times when the service provider can work with the students. Schedules change 
based on outside programs that come into the school for a period of time and the teachers and service providers work 
together to revise the schedule when necessary. In order to ensure ELL-SWDs are scheduled in the least restrictive 
environment, ELL-SWDs partake in all school activities and specials with general education students.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We offer targeted intervention programs for ELLs who need additional academic support outside of the ENL program. These 
programs are offered solely in English. We identify ELLs who would benefit from these programs by looking at the data 
supplied by the EDAT and through our PPT process. Our PPT group meets on a weekly basis to ensure we can quickly identify 
which ELLs could benefit from intervention programs and which program would be to their benefit. Such programs include at-
risk small group work for ELA and math, which are conducted in cycles. Additionally, speech teachers offer small group work 
focused on writing. These groups target expanding ELLs to help them achieve a commanding level of English proficiency by 
either scoring commanding on the NYSESLAT or receiving a 3 on the ELA and expanding on the NYSESLAT. Intervention 
teachers monitor progress on a monthly basis to determine whether or not the ELL still needs the intervention work as an 
extra support. Assessment tools include running records, anecdotal and conferencing notes, and summative assessments. Our 
ELLs also benefit from at-risk social-emotional programs, such as art therapy, banana splits and peer mediation.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

To support our ELL program and maintain compliance for the 2017-2018 year, we are working to hire more dually certified 
teachers that can provide mandated ELL services to our students.  The integrated ENL model will continue to evolve as a much 
bigger part of the ENL program at PS 6. This will require even more collaboration amongst the classroom and ENL teachers to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

ensure the integrated ENL program is a success and a meaningful learning opportunity for the ELL population. Additionally, 
the ENL teacher may perform demo lessons for groups of classroom teachers to model best practices for working with ELLs. 
We also have a trend of more students registering in the lower grades. Therefore, the ELL teacher will be targeting the PD time 
to support teachers working with younger ELLs.  Furthermore,  we will determine whether we will continue the use of the 
Wilson FUNdations program that is currently weaved into the ENL program, as the program is currently implemented by all the 
classrooms. This will eliminate redundancy, while freeing up additional instructional time to focus more on the specific needs 
of the ELL students. The data that supports this potential move is the repetitive nature in the Wilson reading system.  Wilson is 
a strictly formulated curriculum, and with the implementation of this reading system into the classroom, the ENL program may 
need to change or work around what's being done in the classroom in order to provide maximum opportunity for learner 
growth.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not applicable to PS 6 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ELLs have full access to and are using all school programs, including enrichment programs and the after school program, 
which is held inside of the school building. Upper grade ELLs have access to the PS 6 ultimate team and the Casa-Guggenheim 
Program, which takes place after school. ELLs take part in in-school enrichment activities, like Arts Connection and NDI.  There 
are also enrichment programs offered after school, as well as with outside CBO's like Big Apple Sports and the 92 Street 
Y.  These programs are provided to students through fair student funding and Children's First Funds.  PS 6 does not receive 
Title III funds due to the number of ELL students in the building. However, we have used the Title III immigrant funds to invite 
immigrant ELLs to an afterschool program that goes on field trips to museums around our school neighborhood.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
A variety of differentiated instructional materials are utilized within the ENL program. The students have access to a wide 
variety of reading materials that are appropriate for ELLs' age, interest level and English proficiency. These reading materials 
come from classroom libraries (most of them have over 1,000 titles), the school library (with over 100,000 titles), as well as the 
ENL library, which has over 500 titles, geared towards specific languages and cultures. In addition, specific programmatic texts 
tailored to the ELL population are used. For example, the school word study curriculum, Reading Reform and Wordly Wise, is 
modified to fit the specific learning needs of the students.  Classrooms use Promethium boards to further enhance student 
learning and engagement. All classrooms also utilize a variety of technology, such as iPads, videos, and electronic books to 
scaffold instruction and engage students in lessons. ELL students receive a Raz-Kids account that provides online texts that 
engage readers, while modeling new vocabulary and reading strategies. Brainpop Jr. is also a technological resource used to 
teach ELLs both content and language. This website teaches core content, while allowing ELLs to become acclimated to 
idiomatic English.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We provide HLA instructional minutes through the use of bilingual books in the class libraries, bilingual glossaries and 
dictionaries, and by allowing students who speak the same home language to translate for one another. Additionally, many 
classrooms invite ELLs to label parts of the room in their home language or create their own bilingual dictionary to support 
content vocabulary being taught. Some classes invite parents in for special presentations that share part of the culture.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

To support age, grade and proficiency levels of the students, we align our material and instructional resources to meet their 
needs. There is a constant collaboration between the classroom and ELL teachers so that there is a consistency of message and 
content. Administrators and the guidance counselor work alongside the teachers to help streamline these academic and 
linguistic supports. Our goal is to ensure students can actively participate in their classroom lessons at an appropriate linguistic 
level. For example, a 5th grade beginning English Language Learner will be matched with subject texts that would interest a 10 
year old, while meeting the language needs of the same student by providing simpler texts. We choose books and writing 
activities based upon age and grade level, as well as proficiency.  As an example, the Kindergarten ENL class will have a study 
unit on the five senses, while a third grade group will study differences in cultural celebrations.  Both lessons can be adapted to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

suit different proficiency levels, while also providing appropriate and important core curriculum material from each grade 
level.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
PS 6 does not share a building with another school. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Due to the comprehensive nature of our ENL program, we need to be proactive in contacting and informing ELL students and 
families who will be attending PS 6. Our office and ELL teacher identify new ELL students during the registration process in 
order to afford both the student and family additional information and support through the resources available to the parent 
coordinator. Official documents and information about the school is available in a variety of translated languages. In addition, 
as many of our ELL students come from the various hospitals (families of medical staff), consulates and embassies, we have 
working relationships with their staff to exchange information and provide additional resources for those new incoming 
families. The parent coordinator, guidance counselor and ENL teacher want to ensure our new ELLs feel safe, secure and 
welcomed. We invite all newly enrolled ELLs to a meet and greet the day before school starts. During this time, newly 
enrolled ELLs see their new classroom and meet their teachers.  We also have a map in the ENL classroom that showcases 
where all of the ELLs are from and will be creating a new map in our school entryway as a welcome to our newly enrolled ELLs. 
The ENL teacher and parent coordinator are working to establish family ambassadors as well. These volunteers will be a 
resource for the both ELL students and families to better understand the school and neighborhood.  What we would like is for 
our newly enrolled ELLs to feel a sense of community here at PS 6. Helping to foster this community could lead to helping new 
ELLs find friends. It can help push the children to speak English together if they do not have the same native language, or it can 
provide a comfort level to one another if they share the same home language. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

A Mandarin after school program is available to any and all ELLs who would like to join, grades K-5  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have this program. Not applicable to PS 6  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff development is important for teachers of ELLs at our school. The ELL teacher and any other teacher who would like to 
participate take advantage of opportunities like the NYS TESOL conferences, small ELL study groups offered within the district 
and other related workshops. Additionally, the ELL teacher attends professional development days that are focused on using 
Raz-Plus for ELLs, which is facilitated through the DELLSS office. Through these professional development days, the ELL teacher 
can stay informed about successful techniques and assessments.  It is also a great way to become familiar with new 
publications and professional development resources. The ELL teacher is then able to turnkey the information to both teachers 
of ELLs, as well as the administration to ensure we take the necessary steps to follow compliance regulations.  She provides PD 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

to staff on how to scaffold instruction for ELLs, how to meet mandates, and how to access resources that improve instruction 
and communication with parents.  Additionally, the guidance counselor attends professional development on students in 
transition.  
 
There is professional development for all personnel who work with ELLs. Teachers are given important information, including 
testing accommodations and ways to provide scaffolding and differentiated instruction to ELLs. Topics for the professional 
development include: ELLs’ similarities and differences with students with disabilities, cultural sensitivity when working both 
with ELLs and their families, Language Access Coordinator training for translation and interpretation resources. We are also 
planning on having facilitators from Teaching for Change come to provide professional development for teachers on implicit 
biases. Other examples of topics that may be included are how to work with newcomers in the classroom, supporting different 
content areas with newcomers, and ELLs with special needs. For some of these professional developments, articles selected by 
the ELL teacher and the administration are handed out that highlight an awareness of ELLs, methods and strategies for dealing 
with having an ELL in your classroom and other related topics.  At staff meetings readings are discussed and 
analyzed.  Included in the staff meetings are APs, classroom teachers, the literacy coach, cluster teachers, paraprofessionals, 
at-risk teachers, speech and language teachers, OT/PTs, the Parent Coordinator, guidance counselors, the special ed 
and ICT teachers, the psychologists and also all coordinators.  Grade meetings across the year are devoted to helping teachers 
support ELL's in their classrooms. Specific strategies teachers can use in their daily instruction are shared.  The classroom 
teachers attend TC calendar days on the topic of ELLs. We also may begin using demo lessons as part of teachers’ professional 
development. The ENL teacher will model best practices for ELL students in the classroom in order to help teachers scaffold 
instruction to meet the needs of their ELL students. These demo lessons will take place during the school day.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
There is a minimum of 15% of total professional development hours for ELL training for all staff and 50% of total hours for the 
ENL teacher.  We have records to maintain these requirements which have been met that are located in the ELL office. These 
records include agendas from meetings. During the professional development days when students are not in attendance and 
during Monday afternoons that are designated for professional development, there is a certain amount of time allotted on site 
for ENL information and training.  This can last between one to two hours, depending on the session.  Over the course of a 
teacher’s 100 hours of professional development, we will have met or exceeded the 15% assigned to ELL training. Some of the 
training may come from the ELL teacher from network meetings, and some of may come from other ELL specialists or the LAC. 
The ENL teacher will also use portions of the weekly time devoted to professional development to help show best practices for 
ELL students and how to integrate these practices into the classroom. She will also use the time to inform the faculty and staff 
of updated regulations that affect the ELLs in their classroom.  
 
The ENL teacher also documents professional development that is ELL-specific professional development. Records of these 
meetings are kept in the ELL Binder in the ELL office. When the ENL teacher provides the professional development on site, she 
does not receive hours towards her 50%. Most of the ENL teacher’s professional development devoted to ELL-specific topics 
are done off site; these predominantly take place with the Manhattan ELL Field Support Staff and the DELLSS office.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to the parent orientation meetings and the DOE scheduled parent-teacher conferences throughout the year, PS 6 
also provides individual meetings with the parents of ELLs under the CR Part 154 regulations. The ELL teacher is responsible for 
scheduling and conducting these meetings. These meetings are typically held during the mandated parent engagement time, 
which occurs on Tuesdays at PS 6. During these meetings, the ELL teacher and parents meet to discuss the language 
assessment results and goals for the individual student, or students in the case of siblings. The ELL teacher shares the results of 
the latest NYSESLAT or NYSITELL exam and what the English language proficiency goals are for the student. These goals take 
into account the four English literacy skills: speaking, listening, reading and writing. In addition, the ELL teacher communicates 
a classroom goal for the child that is based on content being taught in the classroom in tandem with the ENL program. In 
addition to explaining the goals for the student, the ELL teacher also uses this time to elaborate more on the ENL curriculum 
and how she will help the student reach or exceed those goals. The ELL teacher is responsible for recording the date of these 
meetings and taking notes of what was discussed. These records can be found in the ELL compliance binder in the ELL office. 
Additionally, all other meetings are recorded, including face-to-face interactions and phone calls. Copies of letters sent home 
by the ELL teacher can also be located in the ELL compliance binder and in student cumulative folders. These include mandated 
letters as well as informational letters written by the ELL teacher. These records demonstrate that PS 6 meets the needs of 
parents to feel accommodated and involved in their child’s learning.     
 
In order to address the interpretation and translation needs of the parents, appointments are made for translators if they are 
needed. The parent coordinator and ENL teacher have a running file on all present and previous PS 6 parents and contacts that 
speak other languages, and their contact information as it is needed.  These volunteers are useful with both written translation 
and oral interpretation.  In addition, we utilize the NYCDOE phone translation service and conduct a parent-teacher conference 
utilizing this method, when low-incidence languages are involved. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The parent involvement level at P.S. 6 is extremely high all around, and we are constantly working to involve the ELL parents 
even more. Our biggest success as of late has been creating an annual event called World Night. The parent coordinator invites 
families (both parents and children) that represent different nationalities from around the world to host a booth to showcase 
their culture - whether it be the food, dance, art or sport. All of PS 6 is invited to attend, and it is a huge success. We are 
looking to add another event for ELL families; we believe this would be a welcome breakfast after the ELL Orientation meeting. 
All parents of current and newly enrolled ELLs will be invited to this breakfast as an opportunity to meet one another and build 
an ELL family community. We feel this would be a welcomed addition to our parent engagement, as in previous ELL 
Orientation meetings many parents had conversations with each other and exchanged phone numbers. Additionally, all ELL 
parents are invited to and participate in classroom publishing parties, Parents as Learning Partners (PALP), and PTA meetings. 
PS 6 also uses part of parent engagement time to invite ELL parents in to see what is happening in the classroom. During this 
time, the ELL student is able to showcase the work and learning that is going on in the classroom. Several parents of ELLs are 
highly active.  There are a few who are PTA members and a few who volunteer their time occasionally to help at school. In 
order to ensure that ELL parents know of all of these opportunities, PS 6 ensures that parents receive notification of the above 
mentioned activities via backpacked letters home and the school website.  These letters are translated into the preferred 
home language and interpretation is used when meeting face to face.

Spring, 2018 - ELL Parent Breakfast 
June 14, 2018 - World Night 
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
We are very proud of the ELL program at PS 6. In addition to the academic work being done with the ENL and classroom teachers, 
ELLs also carry various roles within our community. As an example, PS 6 chooses some ELL students to represent our school as tour 
guides for prospective parents. It is wonderful to see students who have grown so much in their English proficiency and now feel 
comfortable speaking to a group of adults. Additionally, ELLs serve as reading buddies between grades. This is a wonderful 
partnership that different classrooms create amongst themselves. 
  
The ENL program also has a showcase for holidays from the countries ELLs represent. The ENL teacher invites parents and ELLs to 
send in information and pictures of a special holiday from their home country. The ELLs then create a beautiful and interactive 
project that is displayed in the hallway for the rest of the PS 6 community to see. 
  
PS 6 has also diligently worked to streamline the registration process to ensure that we correctly identify students who need to be 
screened with the NYSITELL. The parent coordinator, pupil account secretary, administrators, ELL teacher and SETSS teachers work 
together to complete the HLIS form with parents and conduct the interview with the student. Streamlining this process has helped 
the PS 6 community at large better understand the identification and language needs of both ELL students and parents. 
  
Finally, our ENL teacher has worked to create a community of ENL teachers within the district. She organizes times outside of 
school where several ENL teachers meet together to discuss compliance issues and best practices. Cultivating this community of 
ENL teachers has helped our own ELL program, as the ELL teacher is then able to bring the information back and turnkey it to the 
administration and classroom teachers.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lauren Fontana, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The language preferences and needs of the parents at P.S. 6 are identified using a variety of methods during 
interactions with parents. During registration, the ELL teacher and parent coordinator go through the HLIS with all 
new registrants. At this time, we ask families what their preferred language of oral and written communication is 
and put this information in Part III of the HLIS form. If needed, a translated version of the HLIS form or an 
interpreter are made available to help complete the form at the time of registration. Additionally ATS reports 
including RCPL and RAPL are consulted for parents’ preferred language of communication. We also use student 
emergency contact cards to have updated preferred languages on a yearly basis. All staff have access to these 
emergency cards so that every person knows which families need translated documents or an interpreter for face 
to face or phone conversations.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

As we have few families that are limited-English-proficient, we are able to have a plan in place to reach these families 
in the event of a school emergency. We disseminate school emergency information in a translated document at the 
beginning of the school year. This way all our families know what our standard procedures are. We are quickly able to 
email all families in the event of a school emergency. We are able to provide access to Google Translate through these 
emails. While we know this is not a perfect translation, in the event of a school emergency, Google Translate is able to 
give the basic information in the moment, rather than waiting for a full translation of the document. School personnel 
are also able to use Language Line to call families in their preferred language of communication in the event of an 
emergency.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

All staff members are made aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and of the resources that are available 
to meet compliance. The LAC attends a training and turnkeys the information to the staff. Throughout the year, the 
LAC disseminates this information both in the weekly emails all staff receive and in Monday PD time. All staff receive 
information on how to call Language Line to use for either face-to-face meetings or phone calls. Additionally, all staff 
are made aware of the need to have documents made early in order to accommodate the time needed for a vendor 
to translate the document. The principal will consider bringing in the district LTI coordinator for further training.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Parents are made aware of their rights regarding translation and interpretation services and how they may obtain 
these services. We use the information provided in the LAC kit to assist in this effort. We hang up the language poster 
and have brochures in several languages both in the main office and ELL office. These signs are there to help parents 
know of the services we offer. Parents may also be made aware of these rights during meetings with school staff, i.e. 
conferences, IEP meetings, etc. Our school’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of 
language access services are not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language 
barriers. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

PS 6 will gather feedback on the quality and availability of services in a variety of ways. One way will be conducted 
informally when using translation services for face-to-face meetings. The PS 6 staff member will ask if the parent feels 
like the translation service we provide is helping facilitate the conversation with ease and clarity. If the parent feels 
like that form of translation service works for the face-to-face interactions, we will make note of it and continue to 
use that service. If it does not work for the parent, we will use alternative translations services. Another way we will 
gather feedback is through a survey to parents who use the translation and interpretation services. We will be 
distribute a survey to parents who use the translation services or who receive written information that has been 
translated to ensure we provide the services that meet the language access needs of our families. The surveys will be 
provided in the parent’s preferred language. The surveys will provide us with feedback so that we may ensure PS 6 
accommodates the language needs of our families.
