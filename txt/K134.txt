Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At P.S. 134, we are dedicated to creating a learning environment that strives for excellence and sets high expectations 
for all students. This is achieved through rigorous, standards-based curricula and differentiated instruction. All 
students are held accountable to meet these standards. Together, the home and school community instill respect and 
inspire a love for learning.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 134 is a K- Grade 5 School in the Kensington section of Brooklyn. The school is composed of two buildings that 
share a small common yard. The mini building serves as an Early Childhood Center which houses Kindergarten and 
first grade, the main building houses 2 nd to 5 th grade. Currently, there are 570 students enrolled at P.S. 134. 

 

The students represent diverse ethnic populations. Many of the children who attend the school are from families who 
are new immigrants. This diversity helps to create a rich cultural environment in the school.  

 

Classrooms are designed around a print rich environment with common features across grades such as classroom 
libraries, areas for differentiated instruction and classroom computers. Two Literacy Resource Rooms provide 
teachers with an extensive collection of instructional materials to meet the needs of all students.  

 

Curriculum  

P.S. 134 uses a Balanced Literacy Approach for the teaching of reading. This program demonstrates our belief that all 
children are readers and writers, and they learn best when they are immersed in a rich literacy environment. The key 
components of our Literacy Program include: Reading Workshop (Mini-Lesson, Independent/ Partner Reading), Read 
Alouds, Guided Reading, Shared Reading and Word Study. We are a Teachers’ College Reading and Writing Project 
School. We implement daily Writing Workshops consisting of Mini-Lessons (Connect, Teach, Active Engagement, Link), 
Independent Writing and Share Time. 

 

Go Math is used in all grades and lays the groundwork for mathematical literacy. The Go Math program provides time 
for whole group instruction, partner work and individual differentiated activities. Students are encouraged to explain 
and discuss their mathematical thinking.  

 

Classroom science instruction is taught using a hands-on program aligned with the NYC and NYS science standards. A 
Science Specialist Teacher supplements this instruction using an inquiry-based approach. Social Studies instruction is 
taught using an integrated approach aligned with the NYS standards.  

Instructional Technology enhances the learning in all curriculum areas. All children participate in art, music, 
technology, and physical education.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 134 has a growing ELL population. These students face many challenges such as becoming acclimated to a new 
culture and way of life while at the same time learning a new language. This challenge is magnified for students who 
enter the educational system at the upper grade levels. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

One element of the Framework for Great Schools in which the school made the most progress of the past year is 
Collaborative Teachers. Professional development was provided based on the needs of the school and the teachers. 
This learning was then transferred to the instruction provided by the teachers. The teachers also engage in 
intervisitations to see and learn from the best practices of their colleagues. In addition the teachers worked in vertical 
teams to engage in inquiry work. The result of this work was then shared with the school community. Another 
element in which progress was made over the past year is Rigorous Instruction. The school continued to use the 
Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project to help students meet their grade specific Common Core Learning 
Standards. The program has helped to develop the students’ ability to think critically and reason. Another program, 
Go Math, has enabled the students to do this as well.  

The key area of focus for the school year is Strong Family Community Ties. We will work to develop and bring more 
resources into the school, such as CBO’s to help meet the needs of all students while supporting classroom 
instruction. The school will continue to work to find ways to support new families as they enter the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths  

● One of the strengths in the element of Rigorous Instruction is a curricula that is aligned to the CCLS for each grade. 
P.S. 134 uses the Teachers College Reading and Writing program, Go Math, and Social Studies Passport program. This 
alignment is evident by the results of the ELA state test, 65.5% of students scoring levels 3 and 4, an increase of 4.6% 
from 2017. On the State Math test 75.9% of students scored levels 3 and 4, an increase of 10% from 2017  

● Another strength of P.S. 134 is meeting the needs of all populations such as the ESL students. Again this is evident 
by summative assessments such as the NYSESLAT. On this exam, 27% of all students achieved the level of 
Commanding. P.S. 134 was designated a Reward School for High Performance. A criteria for this designation is not 
having “unacceptably large gaps in student performance on an accountability measures between students who are 
members of an accountability group and students who are not members of that group.” 

● The results of TC Assessment Pro for 2016-2017 showed that there was a 7% increase in the number of students 
reading on grade level from September to June.  

● The Go Math end of year assessment showed that 82% of the students were on level.  

 

Needs   

● An analysis of the Learning Environment Survey data shows that there is a need for a more varied curricula.  
● There is also a need for student ownership of learning and increase in student engagement. The average teacher 
rating on Advance in component 3c: Engaging Students in Learning is 3.0 
● A survey shows that 77% of teachers feel that improvement is needed in the development of critical thinking skills 
and the transfer of knowledge across curriculum areas.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths: 

● One of the strengths of Supportive Environment is that 100% of the teachers feel that the students are safe while at 
school. The majority of the teachers also believe that the students listen carefully, pay attention in class and do their 
work. This information was supplied by the Learning Environment Survey.  

 

● The teachers also believe that the social-emotional needs of the students are met in the classroom. Skills such as 
perseverance, confidence and critical thinking skills are embedded into each lesson across all content area. Again this 
information was obtained from the Learning Environment Survey.  

 

● As determined by the MOTP Advance ratings for the all teachers for the 2017-2018, 98% of all observations rated 
teachers Effective or Highly Effective in the component of Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport.  

 

● The data on the OORS report shows there were only 21 incidents for the 2017-2018 school year and only 5 of those 
were level 3 or higher.  

● As determined by lesson plans and curriculum maps all lessons include the opportunity for student discussion, small 
group work and individual conferences.  

 Needs  

● As noted by the MOTP Advance rating of the teachers for the 2017-2018, one of the lowest components in the 
Danielson Framework is 3c: Engaging Students in Learning. 83% of the ratings were Effective or Highly Effective.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the

● As per the Learning Environment Survey from 2016- 2017 the majority of the teachers believe that they receive 
quality professional development, that they design instructional programs, they make a conscious effort to coordinate 
their teaching and that all staff members collaborate to make the school run effectively. The teachers also work to 
improve their teaching and take responsibility for improving the school. The teachers feel responsible that all students 
learn.  

● For the 2017-2018 school year 100% of all teachers were involved in Professional Development on topics to 
improve their craft as well as to coordinate with school wide concerns such as math and technology.  

● For the 2017-2018 school year all new teachers had targeted Professional Development to support them in their 
first year of teaching at P.S. 134. This Professional Development was provided by the Staff Developers.  

● All classroom teachers met with the Teachers College Staff developers to improve their teaching of reading and 
writing for the 2017-2018 school year. The teachers met in various models such as by grade or by a specific need.  

● All classroom teachers, work by grade level to plan their curriculum in all content areas. These sessions are 
facilitated by the grade leaders.  

 

Needs  

● A concern of the teachers are the students’ ability to be accountable for their work and to transfer concepts and 
ideas across curriculum areas. They will also like the students to have more ownership of their work and foster 
independent thinking.  

● The data from the Learning Environment Survey for 2016-2017 indicated that more teachers would like to 
collaborate with teachers from other schools.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

● On the Learning Environment survey out of 15 survey questions the school received a score of 88% or higher on 14 
of the questions. On three of the 15 questions, the school received a perfect score.  

● When the school hold events such as the Holiday Celebration, there is also great parent participation. The parents 
turn out to see their children performances.  

● Another event that results in great parent participation is Parent Teacher Conferences. We have approximately 89% 
attendance at these events.  

● In order to keep the parents aware of their children progress the school provides the parents with 3 additional 
Parent Progress reports. These reports are sent in October, January and May. These reports are translated into the 
necessary languages.  

● The teachers also send to the families a bi-monthly calendar to inform the parents of the topics that will be covered 
in reading, writing, math, science and social studies. The teachers also provide tips to the parents on how they can 
support their children for example simple observations that can be made for science. The cluster teachers also send 
these curriculum calendars.  

● In order to involve the parents in the work of the students the school hosts 3 Family Nights in the curriculum areas 
of Math, Art and Science. The parents are able to work with their children on grade appropriate activities.  

● For Tuesday Parent Engagement all teachers meet with the parents of their students at least once for the school 
year for one-on-one conversation. The school also conducts workshops on these Parent Engagement days 
surrounding the focus of the school for that year. For example, when the school’s focus was math, workshops such as 
the Power of 10 and Understanding Multiplication and Division was held.  

 

Needs: 

● On the Learning Environment Survey, only 66% of the parents responded positively that they were asked to 
volunteer time at the school.  

● During meetings such as the School Leadership Team, the parents expressed a desire to see more project based 
activities at the school. Activities that they can also be part of, whether at the school or at home.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 134, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[PS 134] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and

Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

 

types of materials  

Begin description here:            
The Entering and Emerging  ENL students in Grades 1-5 were selected to take part in a before 
school Title III program to receive supplemental instruction in literacy and math. These 
subgroups of students were chosen to help accelerate their acquisition of the English language 
and their mathematical understanding in English. The decision to provide these students with this 
type of instructional support was based on the results of their NYSESLAT exams. The 
instructional component of the lesson will take place on Tuesday through Friday and run from 
October 15th, 2018  to December` 18, 2018. Instruction will take place from 7:10 A.M. to 7:55 
A.M. Tuesday through Friday, and the teachers will have Mondays, as a planning day for the 
program. The teachers planning will take place from  7:10 A.M. to 7:55 A.M. The students will 
be instructed in English. The two teachers that will provide the literacy component of the 
program will be ENL certified teachers and the two teachers for the Math component will have a 
concentration of courses in Mathematics. The program runs four days a week, two of the days 
the students will have focused ENL/reading instruction and two days of the week the students 
will receive content instruction. There are 43 instructional days. The materials to be used in the 
program will consist of Shared Reading big books (aligned to grade level standards), guided 
reading books, independent leveled texts, grammar and phonics activities, NYSESLAT books 
and Go Math books. The teachers prepare supplemental materials and use other classroom 
materials to support the students' individual needs. The students will also be engaged in using 
technology during this time. The program supervisor will keep track of student attendance, and 
all notifications, which are sent home in the parents' preferred languages. The program 
supervisor also keeps track of outreach to parents, and attendance at parent workshops relevant 
to the program. The parent Coordinator is available to offer home language support as needed.

Part C: Professional Development  
will help the teachers in learning strategies to help the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and 
Expanding  subgroups of ENL students in English language acquisition. The teachers to receive 
training will be the teachers who deliver the literacy component of the lesson. This professional 
development will provide the teachers with the skills they need to meet the needs fo the students 
they are teaching. This in turn will help the students to gain the skills they need to make 
progress, and score Commanding on the NYSESLAT exam. The teachers will also take part in 
professional development centered around phonics instruction. The courses will take place in 
October, November and December of the 2018-2019  school year. These professional 
development workshops are full day workshops that the teachers attend at Teacher's College. 
The topics to be covered are the intersection of reading workshop and ELL instruction and key 
practices to increase the skills and confidence of ELLS. The teachers will also attend workshops 
hosted by the District. When the teachers return from the workshops, they hand in the agendas 
and their notes to the Principal. The teachers delivering the content area instruction will 
receive professional development and support  from the Math Coach.  All information is kept on 
file at school. The teachers also turn-key the information to other staff members. The teachers 
will receive similar professional development in the 2019-2020 school year.  
   

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

 
  name of provider 
  how parents will be notified of these activities 

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  The parents of the ENL students will engage in activities that will help them understand the 
work that the students are engaged in at school and how they can support their children at home. 
The workshop topics have been determined based on the needs that have been expressed by the 
parents to the ENL teachers,  Parents Association and the Parent Coordinator. The meetings will 
be 45 minute sessions that run from September through December. The workshops will be held 
on Tuesdays, after school during Parent Engagement time. Notices will be sent home to all 
parents of ENL students, in their preferred languages, inviting them to attend the workshops that 
will be held. Reminder letters are also sent home, and phone calls are made to the parents, all in 
the parents' preferred language. There are translators present at all meetings and workshops. 
During these workshops, the parents will become familiar with the materials used at the school, 
how they can use the materials sent home, resources to help with the acquisition of English and 
how to monitor the progress of the students. The Staff Developers at P.S. 134, and ENL teachers 
will provide the workshops with translation support. The parents will be notified through letters 
sent home with the students.  All Agendas, attendance sheets, and parents letters will be kept on 
file at school.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 P.S. 134 uses TCRWP assessments to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. Analysis of proficiency level data reveals that 
most students in the Beginning and Intermediate levels are newcomers to the program and are also in Early Childhood grades. 
As students progress through grade levels, they move toward the Advanced levels of proficiency. For the 2017-2018 school 
year, our numbers are as follows:  Kindergarten, there were twenty seven students, fourteen of which were serviced by the 
self-contained Kindergarten ENL teacher, the remaining 13 students are serviced by the ENL teacher. Of those twenty 
seven students,18  were classified as Entering, 1 is Emerging, five were Transitioning, and  three were Expanding. The first 
grade had a total of thirty seven ELL students. All thirty seven ELLs in first grade were serviced by the push in/pull out certified 
ENL teacher. Of those thirty seven students, nine were classified as Entering, eight as Emerging, four Transitioning, eleven 
Expanding, and five Commanding.  In second grade,  there were thirty nine ELL students, three were Entering, seven Emerging, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

three Transitioning, eighteen Expanding, and eight Commanding.  In third grade there were twenty seven  ELLs. Five students 
were entering, one Emerging, three Transitioning, five Expanding, and thirteen Commanding.  All twenty seven students were 
serviced by the push in/pull out ENL teacher. In fourth grade there were eighteen ELLs, who were all serviced by the push 
in/pull out ENL teacher. Six of the fourth grade students were Entering, four were Emerging, two were Transitioning, five 
Expanding, and one Commanding.  In fifth grade there were seventeen ELL students, who were all serviced by the push in/pull 
out ENL teacher. Of the seventeen fifth grade ELLs,  two were Entering,  zero were Emerging, two were Transitioning, seven 
were Expanding, and six were Commanding. This data is used by the classroom and ENL teachers when creating instructional 
plans. After analyzing the data, the teachers use the information to determine which teaching points need to be taught in 
order to address the needs of the ELL students. This data is used when creating monthly curriculum maps in all subject areas, 
as well as determining which students may be in need of more targeted RTI instruction.  The teachers also use the data to form 
small groups, and determine teaching points for individual conferences, and whole class lessons. On a school-wide level, we 
analyze trends across populations and grades, and use that data to determine a school-wide focus, as well as a focus for 
specific populations of students. The data is also used when determining which programs, and materials to purchase to 
support our curriculum in meeting the needs of our ELLs.  We use Go math Assessments to asses Math skills, Periodic 
Assessments to asses ELA, Math and ENL skills, as well as teacher made assessments throughout the school year.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The teachers meet on Monday afternoons, after formal Professional Development, to plan for the students' needs. Teachers 
meet across grade levels and curriculum areas. The teachers also have common planning periods which they use to map out 
curriculum, differentiate instruction, and collaborate with other teachers. The teachers also meet on Tuesday afternoon with 
parents to inform and assist parents in meeting the students' needs both in and out of the classroom. The teachers also have 
grade conferences in which they study and analyze students work, and develop instructional practices according to the 
identified needs of our students. The teachers also work with the Reading and Math Coaches, Staff Developer, and Teacher's 
College Staff Developers.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs by analyzing and interpreting data that is collected throughout the school 
year. The type of data that is analyzed is as follows; NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores, ELL, ELA and Math Periodic Assessments 
scores, ELA, Science and Math State test Scores, data collected from the EDAT, formative assessments such as the assessments 
provided in Leveled Literacy Intervention Program, TCRWP assessments, pre and post assessments, student work, and teacher 
observations, as well as the data from the individual summary reports for the ELL students using the Imagine Learning 
program. By evaluating these reliable and valid assessments, we are able to determine if the programs we have put in place 
are effective for ELLs, and if they provide the differentiation needed to meet the students’ diverse needs. Analyzing data also 
helps us to determine if our ELLs will be successful in making adequate yearly progress with the support of the programs we 
have put in place at our school.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We use the summative data to determine who will receive AIS services. We look at the Teacher's College Reading & Writing 
Assessment Pro Results, as well as Go math ongoing assessments to determine who is in need of further support.  We apply 
the response to intervention model to support students. The School Cabinet meets to analyze the students' data that is 
collected and place students in At-Risk groups as needed. The Cabinet meets ongoing throughout the year and moves 
students in and out of groups  to best meet their changing needs. We also have put in place a morning program to meet the 
needs of the ELL students. Groups are formed based on their modality scores, and proficiency levels.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 134 uses all of the data collected from ELL Periodic Assessments, TCRWP assessments, class work, and teacher made 
assessments, pre and post assessments, state test results, and classroom observations, to help us create a profile for each of 
our ELL students in grades K-5. The information and data collected on each student is analyzed, and from there it is 
determined by the administration and a team of teachers, if a student is in need of extra support in order to meet the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

standards. If it is decided that an ELL student is At-Risk, then we implement the RTI three tiered instructional model, which is 
aimed at prevention and early intervention through a tiered system of instructional support. Instruction for ELLs in English 
language development is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level. The support begins within the classroom and with the ENL 
certified teacher.  The teachers target academically rigorous and challenging instructional goals, while simultaneously 
providing students with the instructional supports they need to achieve success. They also focus on building students’ abilities 
to form, express, and exchange ideas through dialogue, questioning, and sharing ideas and knowledge. In these instructional 
conversations, the teacher listens carefully, collects data on the students’ responses, and uses that data to form small groups 
in order to target the students’ needs. If the level of support provided in Tier I is not successful in supporting a student, we 
then move to add on extra layers of instructional support to the standard core curriculum in order to better support the 
student. Students move into Tier II and Tier III if they demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive academic support. 
This extra support can occur in the classroom provided by an AIS teacher, as well as in separate setting. The instruction during 
a pull-out targeted Intervention group is focused on specific learning targets based on the students’ individual reading levels, 
language needs, as well as their identified area of academic weakness.  We use a research based Leveled Literacy Intervention 
Program to provide the Tier II and Tier III At- Risk ELL students with intensive academic support. Based on the demonstrated 
and changing needs of the ELLs, the levels of intervention and instructional support may increase in duration and intensity 
over time. Data is collected through the use of formal, reliable and valid assessments, and analyzed frequently. If a student 
shows improvement, the extra supports are removed or varied as needed.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 Examining the 2016-2017 school year data across performance levels, first grade did the best on the reading section of the 
test, followed by listening, with their weakest area being writing & speaking. In second grade the students did best on the 
speaking followed by listening, with their weakest area being reading. In third grade the students scored best on the speaking 
and writing, followed by reading, with their weakest area being listening. In fourth grade the students scored best on the 
speaking and writing section of the test, followed by listening with their weakest area being reading.  In fifth grade, the 
students scored best on speaking and writing, and their weakest area was the listening section of the test.  On the NYSITELL for 
Kindergarten, 21 students scored at the Entering level, 2  at the Emerging level, 4 at the Transitioning level, 3 at the Expanding 
level. 
It is believed at our school that instruction must link audio-oral communication and print communication through book and 
literature responses, Shared Reading and Writing sessions, Accountable Talk, Listening Center activities, Whole Class 
Conversations, and peer and teachers conferences. Content area reading and writing are supported by extensive Leveled 
Libraries, encouraging content-rich vocabulary and critical thinking skills.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The School Cabinet meets to analyze the students' data that is collected and make any changes that may need to be put in 
place in order to ensure success for all ELL students. We use the summative data to determine who will receive AIS services. 
We look at the Teacher's College Reading & Writing Assessment Pro Results, as well as Go math ongoing assessments to 
determine who is in need of further support.  We apply the response to intervention model to support students. The School 
Cabinet meets to analyze the students' data that is collected and place students in At-Risk groups as needed. This information 
is shared with all staff involved in teaching the students. The Cabinet meets ongoing throughout the year and moves 
students in and out of groups  to best meet their changing needs..The Cabinet meets ongoing throughout the year to make 
adjustments to AIS programs. The ENL teachers, AIS program teachers, Cluster and Classroom teachers all collaborate in order 
to meet the needs of the ELL students, The ENL teachers, classroom and AIS teachers all  meet with Administration to help 
determine which programs, curriculum and support resources should be purchased to support the instructional programs 
already in place.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

As of the 2016-2017 school year, P.S. 134 has a free standing ENL program. There is one self-contained Kindergarten 
ENL class. The other eligible ELLs are placed in a push in/pull out ENL program model, based on their language needs. 
At P.S. 134 all ELL students who are determined to be Entering, receive 1 unit (180 minutes) of standalone ENL 
instruction, and 1 unit (180 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction, for a total of 360 instructional minutes per 
week. Students who are determined to be Emerging receive .5 units (90 minutes) of standalone ENL instruction, 1 unit 
(180 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction, .5 units (90 minutes) of either standalone ENL instruction or 
Integrated ENL/content area instruction, for a total of 360 instructional minutes per week. Students who are 
determined to be Transitioning receive .5 units (90 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction, .5 units (90 minutes) 
of either standalone ENL instruction or integrated ENL/content area instruction, for a total of 180 minutes per week. 
Students who are determined to be Expanding receive 1 unit (180 minutes) of ENL/ELA instruction, for a total of 180 
instructional minutes per week. Students who are determined to be Commanding receive .5 units of Integrated ENL in 
ELA/Content area ELL services for a total of 90 instructional minutes per week, for two years after becoming classified 
as Commanding. Students are grouped heterogeneously (mixed proficiency levels) and some are homogeneously (all 
the same proficiency levels in one group,) based on their specified language need.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           P. S. 134 has free standing ESL program. Our staff is organized in order to meet the requirements for ENL instruction of 
all students, at all proficiency levels. CR Part 154.2 compliance in ensured by the licensed teachers explicitly scheduling and 
grouping students according to their grade level, proficiency level, and mandated number of instructional minutes. Students 
are serviced in small groups based on their targeted instructional goals. Students receive whole group and small group 
common core aligned instruction in both ELA and in the content areas. The Kindergarten ELLs  receive instruction in the self-
contained ENL classroom by a trained dual licensed ENL teacher. The self-contained ENL class receives instruction using the 
workshop model in all subject areas. The ELLs not in self-contained ENL classrooms have a push in/pull out model, and are 
taught by licensed ENL teachers. ELL students who are determined to be Entering , receive 1 unit (180 minutes) of standalone 
ENL instruction, and 1 unit (180 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction, for a total of 360 instructional minutes per 
week.  Students who are determined to be Emerging receive .5 units (90 minutes) of standalone ENL instruction, 1 unit (180 
minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction, .5 units (90 minutes) of either standalone ENL instruction or Integrated 
ENL/content area instruction, for a total of 360 instructional minutes per week. Students who are determined to be 
Transitioning (Intermediate) receive .5 units (90 minutes) of Integrated ENL/ELA instruction, .5 units (90 minutes) of either 
standalone ENL instruction or integrated ENL/content area instruction, for a total of 180 minutes per week.  Students who are 
determined to be Expanding receive 1 unit (180 minutes) of ENL/ELA instruction, for a total of 180 instructional minutes per 
week. Students who are determined to be Commanding (Proficient) receive .5 units of Integrated ENL in ELA/Content area ELL 
services for a total of 90 instructional minutes per week, for two years after becoming classified as Commanding. Students are 
grouped heterogeneously (mixed proficiency levels) and some are homogeneously (all the same proficiency levels in one 
group,) based on their specified language need.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All ELLs in the freestanding ENL program at P.S. 134 have access to high quality content area instruction that is aligned to the 
common core learning standards in each subject area. Teachers develop language and cognitive skills through content topics 
and themes using grade appropriate materials. Through professional development they learn ENL methodology and strategies 
to support all proficiency levels of ELLs and provide them with the opportunity to meet the content area standards as 
measured by the various related assessments. The teachers provide challenging content, and well-developed learning 
strategies to prepare ELLs to think critically, solve problems, and communicate in the language of instruction. ELLs are actively 
engaged in standards-based academic curriculum with their monolingual counterparts in the regular classroom setting. 
Students use leveled non fiction texts throughout the day. The teacher embeds grade appropriate content area instruction in 
her reading and writing program. Lessons are designed to meet standards while there is differentiated instruction to meet 
student needs. The teacher uses a workshop model to deliver instruction. The teachers use a combination of vocabulary 
development, visual supports, and technology to enhance student learning. Instruction is designed to mediate the learning of 
various proficiency classifications: entering, emerging, transitioning, expanding, and commanding, as well as, ELL students 
classified as SIFE and ELLs who also have IEPs. On-going assessment strategies are used to determine movement towards 
acquiring content standards.  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   To ensure ELLs are evaluated in their native languages throughout the year, we offer the NYS Math and Science exams to the 
students in their native languages, as well as Periodic Assessments. We also offer the use of bilingual glossaries to all ELLs on 
all classroom assessments. We also have translators on staff as needed.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

A) In instances of Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE), the students receive intensive academic intervention 
services based on formal and informal assessments of academic and social needs. Grade and age appropriate lessons and 
activities are provided in small group and whole class settings. The Guidance Counselor assists the children in their transition 
and integration into mainstream classrooms.  
  
B) Newcomers at P.S. 134 are grouped by language proficiency and by grade level. Emphasis for these students is on 
acculturation, basic vocabulary, verbal communication, and literacy development. We also offer our newcomer ELLs services 
through our Title III programs. Students are grouped according to their proficiency levels. Teachers determine what the 
students need the most support in as well as determining what obstacles may be hindering their abilities to meet the 
standards. Entering and Transitioning level students receive more modeled and guided support, more basic vocabulary 
development, more visual supports built into the curriculum, lower level texts, as well as more access to the use of 
manipulatives. Transitioning level students are asked more advanced level questions, exposed to higher level texts, receive 
less picture support, are taught more Tier 2 words, and are engaged in more discussion and partner work. Expanding and 
Commanding  level students receive more individual activities, learn Tier 3 words, are given advanced level texts, are taught 
advanced comprehension strategies, are engaged in more partner work and discussions, extend their learning through writing, 
and are expected to transfer learning to all subject areas. We have also implemented the Imagine Learning literacy technology 
program that our ELLs take part in as well.  
  
C)     For ELLs receiving services for four to six years, academics and content-area studies are emphasized. They attend test 
sophistication instruction in a small group setting. Additionally, they are invited to our Title III programs. We have purchased 
the several programs to support their learning, such as the Gear UP ELL program by the Wright Group, Benchmark for English 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

Language Learners, Empire State, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, and the Leveled Literacy Intervention Program by Fountas 
and Pinnell. We have also implemented the Imagine Learning literacy technology program that our ELLs take part in as well. 
We also hire teachers to provide supplemental support to these students.  
  
D)     For long-term ELLs academics and content are studies are emphasized. They attend test sophistication instruction in a 
small group setting. Additionally, they are invited to our Title III programs. We have purchased the several programs to 
support their learning, such as the Gear UP ELL program by the Wright Group, Benchmark for English Language Learners, 
Empire State, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, and the Leveled Literacy Intervention Program by Fountas and Pinnell. These 
student are also engaged in the Imagine Learning literacy program. We also hire teachers to provide supplemental support to 
these students.  
  
E)     Former or Commanding ELLs continue to receive support in their classroom setting. The teachers differentiate instruction 
to meet their needs and provide the scaffolds necessary to ensure they are successful in meeting the grade level requirements. 
They receive language instruction from the certified ENL teachers for two years after becoming proficient on the NYSESLAT. 
Testing modifications are provided for up to two years after students have scored proficiency if needed.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers use a workshop model, a to-with-and by approach (model-guide-release) to teach all subject areas. They use 
differentiated instruction and small groups based on the students’ needs. Teachers create charts and other visual 
representation to support learning. All materials that are used at the school are common core aligned and grade appropriate. 
Texts are matched to the students’ levels, and text complexity is considered when materials are selected for reading 
instruction. All classroom libraries contain leveled texts, and well as content and thematic books, to support all learning. 
Students are exposed to a variety of technology in their classrooms, such as document cameras, computers, listening centers, 
and Smartboards, which all help to support and accelerate English Language Development. Students read leveled texts in all 
genres of study throughout the course of the school year. If the current unit of study in embedded in fiction, then the students 
are encouraged to read fiction in school, and non fiction, content specific texts at home.  Students are exposed to a variety of 
texts that help to build vocabulary, make meaning, and are print rich to support language acquisition.  School libraries have 
books on various cultures throughout the world, and bilingual glossaries are available for all students who require such 
support. All ELL-SWDs receive their services mandated on their IEPs based on their program recommendations, as well as ENL 
instruction in a freestanding ESL program. The ENL teachers and the Special Education teachers coordinate their schedules to 
make sure the students are receiving all services they are mandated to receive. Schedules are checked and approved by the 
administration.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWDs are provided differentiated instruction based on their individual learning needs and strengths. Instruction is targeted 
to and appropriate for the student’s level of English proficiency and learning needs. These students receive support from 
Special Education teachers in the least restrictive environment. The Special Education teachers also work in conjunction with 
the ENL teacher to ensure that the students are meeting their goals.  Time is scheduled for collaboration and instructional 
planning among all teachers servicing these students. The SBST collaborates with the Assistant Principal to discuss flexible 
programming options when appropriate. The School Implementation Team also meets to provide appropriate services and 
programming flexibility to students as needed. All special education staff also attends professional development monthly 
meetings with the Assistant Principal to work on goal setting, flexible programming, and share best practices to help accelerate 
learning and language development, and assure that all students are being educated in the least restrictive environment. Each 
ELL-SWD is looked at individually and a program is designed to best fit the needs of that individual student.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Students at every grade and proficiency level are instructed using the workshop model and balanced literacy curriculum. 
Instructional modifications are made to address the needs of individual students’ needs and strengths, as well as their ELL 
proficiency status. In grades 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the ENL teacher pushes in and pulls out groups on a daily basis, according to the 
explicit schedule that’s assures compliance with CR part 154.2 instructional unit requirements. All classrooms, including those 
of the ENL teachers, have extensive Leveled Libraries rich with content area literacy, reflecting the abilities, levels, needs, 
interest, and cultures of all students. All students have access to common core standards based instructional materials in all 
content areas, such as social studies, science and the arts. ENL teachers use multiple approaches and a variety of materials, 
including visual aids, audio materials, and technologies which are all common core aligned. Students utilize computers and 
Internet based resources in order to conduct research and compile information to enrich their learning. Teachers use the Go 
Math Program with all students, which offer differentiation for all subgroups of students. The ELL students of all proficiency 
levels receive instruction in small groups within the classroom to support their learning. The workshop model is also used in 
science and social studies. The students are supported in small group settings throughout the day. Instruction in the content 
area is supported by students reading content based texts at their instructional level. We also have Title III teachers in the 
school that support students in K-5 across all subject areas. We have reading teachers, reading and math coaches that support 
students by pulling them into small groups to offer additional support as needed. Cluster teachers also provide additional 
support to our ELLs in the content areas. ELLs are also invited to Title III programs to support learning. Entering ELL students 
are also provided with further targeted instruction using a Leveled Literacy Intervention Program. Our ELLs are also engaged in 
the Imagine Learning program. Imagine Learning is a research-based, instructionally differentiated language and literacy 
software program. Imagine Learning provides strategic first-language support to facilitate and enhance ELL learning. As 
students become more proficient in English, this language support gradually fades, preparing students for English-only 
environments. In addition to strategic translations, the program also uses peer modeling to illustrate concepts more clearly. 
Same-age peers explain what words and phrases mean in rich, contextualized examples. By seeing real kids use key vocabulary 
in real-life settings, ELLs are more engaged, enabling them to understand each concept more fully. Imagine Learning also 
provides scaffolded practice—with front-loaded vocabulary, graphic organizers, and clickable glossary words with 
translations—to support English language learners every step of the way.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will continue to support the use  of the Imagine Learning Program, as well as the use of our Leveled Literacy Intervention 
Program, since the data has proved that both have been successful in supporting and advancing our ELLs. Students will also 
continue to have the use of the RAZ Kids, both at home and in school. We will continue to provide our ELLs with learning 
experiences that will connect to their personal, cultural, language, and world experiences. We will continue to purchase more 
non fiction books to add to the classroom libraries, and school library to help support the content and provide a culturally rich 
curriculum. Our teachers will to take part in professional development and workshops that are aimed at the developmental 
process of language and content learning as well as designing small group activities that engage ELLs in multiple opportunities 
to apply the language of content. Technology is also purchased yearly to help support the classrooms, the curriculum, the ELLs, 
and their monolingual counterparts.  For the upcoming school year we have purchased the Imagine Learning Cloud Program, 
which allows all of our ELL students to access all the program has to offer at home as well as in school all year round. In 
addition more licenses have been purchased for the Imagine Learning program to allow more students the opportunity to take 
part in the program.     
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Based on the parental choice form, we do not have a need for a bilingual program at this time.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 At P.S. 134 our ELLs are invited to a Title III morning program which focuses on targeted intervention in the areas of ELA and 
Math. Letters are sent home, in the preferred language of every ELL family inviting them to attend the morning program. All 
students who participate are then given a follow up letter, in their preferred language describing all the program details. All 
ELLs who were invited to the program are participating. Additionally, if there is a demonstrated need, ENL students will receive 
academic intervention services. Parents will receive information regarding these services, as well as updates to student 
progress. We have Level I ELLs take part in an AIS Literacy Intervention program aimed at increasing their vocabulary, literacy 
skills, and language acquisition. If the students are to participate in this program, letters are sent home, in the preferred 
language of every ELL informing the families of their participation, and progress in the program. Our ELLs also take part in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

Imagine Learning Literacy program. All ELLs participate in all Technology, Science, Social Studies/Library, Gym, Music, and Art 
cluster programs. All ELLs attend school trips, participate and are involved in all school celebrations, such as concerts, dance 
festivals, and student celebrations. When any school event is taking place, letters are sent home to all families in the school, in 
their preferred language, informing, and inviting them to attend the upcoming event. Our holiday concerts reflect and 
celebrate the students’ cultures. We use multicultural books that reflect the ethnic populations in our school. We also 
encourage students to share what they know about their culture with others.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The materials for balanced literacy instruction include extensive leveled libraries. In addition, materials integrate content area 
such as social studies, science, and the arts. Selections of materials carefully consider the academic needs of the ELLs and their 
cultural backgrounds. Lessons are supported by visual aids and audio materials. SMARTboards and computers are used in the 
classrooms, Technology room, Library, and Science room, to enhance the development of vocabulary and concepts being 
taught. Computer software programs provide additional support to the ELLs. The ENL teachers use both the Department of 
Education’s content area curriculum materials as well as supplemental materials that are on the level of the students which 
support content area learning. Materials include leveled books, paired books (fiction and nonfiction), ELL instruction books, 
and listening center materials. We also have Rigby books, Benchmark Education books, NYSESLAT test preparation books, 
phonics and grammar books, which are all used to meet the needs of all subgroups of students. Other materials include the 
Imagine Learning Program, RAZ Kids, as well as the use of our Leveled Literacy Intervention Program.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

At P.S. 134 we currently have a freestanding ENL program. Instructional support it provided mainly in English, however we 
have staff members available to translate into the students’ native languages when needed. Students also buddy up with other 
students who speak both their native language and English, to support them socially.  All correspondence is sent home in the 
families' preferred native language.  We have also incorporated Imagine Learning to 1/4 of our ELL's.  We have provided these 
ELL children with their own laptop or iPad to use it daily.  This interactive program uses the student's home language.   A child 
is given an activity to try initially in English, if they are consistently getting incorrect answers the program then asks them in 
their home language.  The teacher is able to look at students progress through generated reports where the teacher can find 
out about the child's proficiency in their home language and English abilities.  The program is automatic, where it generates 
the activities and skills based upon the students individual needs.  We have updated this service to a "cloud" feature, so the 
children are able to use this at home.  We have also subscribed to Reading AtoZ.  This service provides teachers with many 
resources, some of which are available in other languages.  Teachers use these resources as a supplement to their daily 
curriculum teaching. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our program and curriculum are designed to promote the language development of ELLs as they acquire academic proficiency 
in English. Support services are tailored to the individual students’ needs in order to ensure that all of our ELLs meet the 
rigorous Common Core and ELL standards. We purchased leveled texts, high interest low readability texts and 
fiction/nonfiction paired books. We look at the content area standards to see the topics that need to be covered in each grade 
level. Materials are purchased at different readabilities. Students in grades K-2 are engaged in a variety of literacy centers. 
These centers also support their listening and speaking skills. Students are exposed to leveled materials as well as grade 
appropriate materials to offer them opportunities to advance through the curriculum.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The materials for balanced literacy instruction include extensive leveled libraries. In addition, materials integrate content area 
such as social studies, science, and the arts. Selections of materials carefully consider the academic needs of the ELLs and their 
cultural backgrounds. Lessons are supported by visual aids and audio materials. SMARTboards and computers are used in the 
classrooms, Technology room, Library, and Science room, to enhance the development of vocabulary and concepts being 
taught. Computer software programs provide additional support to the ELLs. The ENL teachers use both the Department of 
Education’s content area curriculum materials as well as supplemental materials that are on the level of the students which 
support content area learning. Materials include leveled books, paired books (fiction and nonfiction), ELL instruction books,

and listening center materials. We also have Rigby books, Benchmark Education books, NYSESLAT test preparation books, 
phonics and grammar books, which are all used to meet the needs of all subgroups of students. Other materials include the 
Imagine Learning Program, RAZ Kids as well as the use of our Leveled Literacy Intervention Program.     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The ENL teacher meets with all parents of new admits who have been identified as in need of ENL instruction. She also 
determines if the parents are in need of translation and interpretation services. When parents visit the Main Office, the Parent 
Coordinator and the Pupil Accounting Secretary inform the school of any parent who may need further support 
communicating in English. If parents need translation in any language, we have staff members translate in the language of the 
parent. We also translate all correspondence that is sent home into the language of the family. Students and their families are 
invited to visit our school, and the guidance counselor is available to speak with the families to make sure their transition is a 
seamless one. When ELLs enroll throughout the school year, the same process is followed as when a student enrolls at the 
beginning of the year. Students are supported by staff members and their peer buddies. The Guidance Counselor meets with 
new incoming students to discuss the adjustment to a new school and help ease their transition. The Pupil Support teacher 
also meets with incoming students. Teachers pair new incoming students with another classmate that speaks their language to 
make them feel more comfortable and assist them with communicating. All activities at the school are planned considering the 
family, cultural, and language background of students, to celebrate and include students in the school community and to 
educate staff about its diversity.

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Through professional development offered at our school, teachers continually learn about language development, literacy and 
content instruction, effective ENL strategies, and New York State ENL Learning Standards. Teachers also attend off-site 
workshops at Teachers College, district conferences and seminars related to ENL.  These workshops and seminars focus on the 
latest research, most effective practices for teaching ELLs, and how to differentiate instruction to align with students’ prior 
knowledge, learning, and language needs. Paraprofessionals attend professional development in house, and at the district. The 
certified ENL teachers attend Teacher’s College workshops which focus on best practices for teaching ELLs such as adapting the 
reading and writing workshop to provide maximum support for our ELLs. Staff members attend Teachers College Calendar 
Days geared to ENL instruction throughout the course of the year. Administration attends these workshops as well. Staff 
members who attend these ELL specific workshops turnkey this information at Grade Conferences and Faculty Conferences. All 
staff members, including the Psychologist, Guidance Counselor, and Speech teacher attend these conferences. Teachers also 
meet weekly, by grade, to create monthly curriculum maps. Teachers take part in weekly Professional Development at our 
school. Some of the sessions are focused on specific ELL practices. Teachers also work collaboratively to evaluate student work 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

and data to ascertain the language and cognitive demands of tasks aligned to standards. The ENL teachers provide insight for 
the regular classroom teachers. During school-wide professional development days, teachers of ELL's work together to 
implement best practices into their curriculum planning. Teachers were given  professional development days to focus on 
mapping the content area curriculum and differentiating for all subgroups of students.     
 Our teachers of ELL's attend workshops and seminars that focus on the latest research, most effective practices for teaching 
ELL's, and how to differentiate instruction to align with students’ prior knowledge, learning, and language needs. Professional 
development provided by the school, Teachers College, and the District, help support the certified ENL teachers in the 
implementation of the Common Core Standards. Teachers learn best practice to ensure that our ELL's are able to meet the 
demands of the rigorous common core curriculum. Teachers map curriculum, collaborate to select the best instructional 
materials to meet the needs of the ELL's, and match the standards to their teaching points across all areas of study. They also 
engage in designing assessments that address the specific common core standards being addressed in each unit of study. 
Teachers also map curriculum across the school year, and across all content areas, to ensure that all common core standards 
are being addressed, and assessed over the course of the school year. When teachers are mapping curriculum they also 
incorporate UDL practices into their planning. The administration and the ENL teachers also attended professional 
development on the implementation of the new Common Core Aligned NYSESLAT exam. Our professional development targets 
the needs of our ENL teachers, and provides them with the support they need to ensure all students are successful. The 
teachers work to understand and interpret rubrics, student work, and discuss instructional strategies to meet the needs of our 
ELL's. We also schedule intervisitations for our teachers so they are able to observe best practices.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The administration arranges for the Guidance Counselor to attend professional development level, in order to gather 
information she can turn key to all staff on helping ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle school.  The Guidance 
Counselor then works with the ENL teachers to support ELLs as they transition to middle school. The Guidance Counselor and 
the Pupil Support Teacher work with the parents in conjunction with the Parent Coordinator and other staff members to help 
parents with the middle school application process. The 5th grade teachers also attended professional development to learn 
ways to support our students as they transition to middle school.  The Guidance Counselor, Pupil Support Teacher, Parent 
Coordinator, along with translators, hold a meeting titled, “Making the Middle School Choice.” This meeting provides the 
parents with information they need to make the best choices for their children. There are translators available for parents at 
this meeting. The Guidance Counselor also makes regular phone calls and holds meeting with parents who need further 
support in making decisions about middle schools. This support team helps parents decide which schools suit them best. 
Translation services are provided.    
  The principal plans in order to address the needs of the school and ensure that the school meets the ELL specific professional 
development requirements as per the CR Part 154.2 (15% of the 175 total hours over five years for all teachers, and 50% of the 
total 175 hours over five years for ENL teachers.) In order to do this, the school provides the hours of ELL training for all staff 
through our partnership with the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project. Teachers College professional development 
workshops, study groups, and on-site training take place throughout the school year. The teachers of ELLs who attend specialty 
ELL workshop days, turnkey the information they learn on helping ELLs, to the other staff members at Faculty Conferences, 
Grade Conferences, Professional Development periods, and common preps. We also provide development to the all staff 
during Grade Conferences, professional development days, Teachers College Workshops, and Teachers College Staff 
Developers. During these meeting times, strategies for teaching ELLs are shared, modeled, demonstrated, and practiced. The 
Teacher’s College Staff Developers are also providing days of staff development at the school, in addition to the professional 
development the teachers attend outside of the school. The teachers also attend District ELL meetings when they are held. The 
schools, as well as the teachers themselves, keep records of the professional development they attend.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S. 134 provide individual meetings with parents of ELLs ongoing throughout the school year. These meetings take place 
weekly during Parental Involvement Tuesdays from 2:30-4:00 P.M. They also take place during parent Curriculum Conferences 
throughout the school year and during the teacher’s prep time if that works better for the parents. The ENL teachers are also 
available to meet with parents upon request. During these meeting the teacher’s discuss goals of the program, language 
development, assessments results, and language development needs in all content areas.  There are also workshops held for 
the parents where they can discuss concerns one on one with staff members. Translation services are offered at all meeting, 
events, and workshops.  
  
The teachers keep individual logs of when they call parents and meet individually with parents throughout the year. When 
teachers meet with parents at school wide events, there are also records kept, in the form of attendance. Attendance is also 
taken at curriculum conferences and at all workshops that are held for parents of ELLs. When the ENL teachers meet with 
parents during individual orientations, they also keep attendance logs.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 P.S. 134 strives to include parents in all aspects of their children’s learning, including parents of ELLs. In the beginning of the 
year the parents are invited to Classroom Curriculum Conferences at which translation services are provided. Parents are also 
invited to observe teacher lessons, attend workshops in ELA, and Math, participate in Family Night activities and are invited to 
attend several parents meetings that are planned around their topics of interest. Parent Workshops are held ongoing 
throughout the school year, and translation services are offered at all workshops. Some of the Parent Workshop  topics are as 
follows, “Making the Middle School Choice,” “ELL Parent Orientation,”  “Kindergarten Parent orientation,” “Help Your Child 
Adjust to Kindergarten,” “Safety Workshop,” “NYS ELA Exams,” “NYS Math Exams,” “Homework and Study Habits,” “Your 
Child’s Learning Style.,” just to name a few. The workshops are designed based on parents’ feedback. Parents are also invited 
to school wide and individual classroom celebrations. Translation services are provided throughout all activities in various 
languages that are needed. Information prior to these events is also sent home in various languages. Teachers College also 
provides parents opportunities for parents to participate in parent workshops. District meeting and opportunities for parents 
are ELLs are also shared with the parents. There are technology meeting for parents as well. The PA also offers translations at 
their meetings and events, such as multicultural night. The teachers also have events during the school day such as "Cultural 
Day," where parents are invited to participate and attend.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Debra Ramsaran, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 134 uses various forms of data to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and 
oral communication. The ENL teacher reviews every home language survey (HLIS) and makes a list of all of the 
preferred languages of each parent. The school also reviews each student's emergency contact card and 
documents the parent’s preferred written and oral language. This information is shared school wide. Additionally, 
we print the RCPL (Parents' Preferred Language Report) from ATS and compile a list of all of the parent’s 
preferred languages. We use this information to be able to communicate and translate all correspondence for the 
parents in their preferred language. A report is created by the ENL teacher, Ms. Dory, which lists all of the 
languages the parents speak, by class and by grade. This report is updated monthly, and distributed to all staff 
members. The ENL teachers also hold parents meetings to gather information about the parents' language 
preferences, as well as any parent or student needs.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

P.S. 134 has staff members, parent association members, and SLT members who speak the preferred languages of the 
families in our school. The languages our staff members speak are listed below. In the event of an emergency, Staff 
members are instructed to make phone calls home to the parents as needed and in their preferred language, and as 
directed. There is a translation team that is in place for this type of scenario. This plan is discussed during Faculty 
Conferences. In the event that we did not have any immediate staff members available for translation, we would 
utilize the translation and Interpretation Unit for assistance.

the-phone interpretation service available to all schools. All staff members are informed of the Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663 at the beginning of the year Faculty Conferences, and revisited as needed. All staff members are also 
given school documents listing all of the preferred languages of the parents and students in their classes and in the 
school, as well as a list of which staff members they can contact in order to provide translations as needed. All staff 
members are also given the I speak cards to use during meetings. Staff members utilize translation technology that is

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

P.S. 134 offers translation and interpretation services for all parents in their preferred language. All school documents 
are translated and sent home in the parent's preferred language. Parents are made aware of their right to receive 
information by way of face to face meetings with office staff and teachers, as well as through the information that is 
sent home in their preferred languages. We have staff members available to translate in a parent's preferred 
language, at all school events such as cultural events, concerts, dance performances, parent meetings and workshops, 
when parents visit the school, at registration, when conducting IEP meetings, or just general inquiries. If we do not 
have a staff member who can speak the preferred language of a parent available at a given time, we call the 
translation and interpretation unit for assistance.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We gather feedback from the parents at our school through the use of parent surveys, Town Hall Meetings, informal 
conversations, SLT meetings, Parent Teacher Conferences, Parent Engagement Tuesdays, Parent Association 
meetings, by way of feedback given to the Parent Coordinator, and Parent Association. The SLT, and School Cabinet 
meets to disseminate information, compile data and feedback and devise plans to best meet the needs of the families 
in our school. Based on the information we receive we make changes to the procedures we already have in place, or 
create new plans if needed. Cabinet meetings are held weekly, and SLT meetings are held monthly.
