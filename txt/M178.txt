Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Public School 178 is located in the Washington Heights community of Manhattan. This school serves population of 
approximately 285 students from culturally and economically diverse backgrounds. The school building is a well-kept 
modern building where pride in the students’ accomplishments is evident in the prominently displayed student work.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

  Mission Statement : At P.S. 178 we believe that all students should be given the foundational skills and 

technological tools necessary to prepare them for success in the 21 st century. By providing a rigorous 
academic curriculum students will leave our school as problem solvers, critical thinkers and responsible 
citizens. P.S.178 prides itself on having a caring environment that nurtures student confidence and emotional 
well being. We foster mutual respect and social responsibility by placing an emphasis on strong partnerships 
between home, school and the community. We believe in supporting diverse learners and presenting 
students with equal opportunities to achieve their optimal academic performance. We understand that in 
order for every child to be successful they must be fully supported both inside and outside of our school.  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P. S. 178 takes a continuous improvement approach to developing rigor and improving student performance, using 
school wide assessments, analysis of student work, and other indicators to identify and address student strengths and 
weaknesses and target areas for growth on a continuous basis. Ongoing assessment is both formal and informal. 
Other assessments also used to inform instruction include MOSL, Fountas and Pinnell Reading IRL Assessment, Go 
Math Assessments, Teachers College Reading and Writing Project Assessments, and Systema del Evaluación de la 
Lectura in all grades. These help teachers make appropriate decisions as they select reading materials for students, 
design curriculum, modify programs, plan activities, organize trips and structure literacy programs.  

. 

● CBO : P.S. 178 enjoys the partnerships of several community based organizations including YWHA, CHALK (Choosing 
Healthy Active Lifestyle for Kids) , Children Arts and Science After-school Program, and Dancing Classrooms . 

Family Involvement : At P. S. 178, we recognize that families and other community members are a vital part of all 
students' academic and social success, and consider family involvement an essential ingredient for a successful 
educational program. Our continuing efforts will focus on strengthening home-school relationships and increasing 
parent and community involvement school-wide. To support parent involvement efforts, a Parent Coordinator is 
assigned to the school for the 2018-2019 school year. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

P. S. 178 is a unique K-5 public school of choice where a diverse group of learners (regular education, special 
education, dual language, ASD, and ELLs) gain their first school experience in a nurturing, yet focused atmosphere. 
Deriving its population from various ethnic groups, the school addresses its multiculturalism through an integrated 
curriculum that stresses literacy through developmentally appropriate teaching in language arts, mathematics, 
science, social studies, technology, and visual arts. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

School Community Statement : P. S. 178 recognizes that in order to meet the diverse needs of the students and 
families of this community, the role of the school has to expand beyond traditional definitions of teaching and 
education. Thus, we will strive to provide services and opportunities that address the academic, social and health 
needs of the community. In 2018-19 we will focus on improving school-wide math achievement by creating a 
supportive learning environment, increasing vigorous math instruction, inviting students to a Math after-school 
academy,and participating in collaborative teacher teams that focus on math fluency and math literacy, as well as 
balanced literacy instruction. 

● School-wide Focus:  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Frequent Assessments - Teachers and students will have a clear understanding of their progress in reaching school-
wide goals. Each child will be aware and be able to articulate their present level of performance and their next steps 
toward meeting goals.  

Collaborative Conversations - All students will be engaged in high quality discussions, which will promote student 
ownership and voice in academic and social language across content areas with a strong focus in Mathematics. 

Portfolio - Portfolio Committee will review portfolios to continue to develop a clear coherent portfolio to use across 
all grades, which all teachers will implement. 

● Theory of Action : If we continually support an inclusive curriculum & teaching practice, then all our 

students will deepen their knowledge and reach their highest level of achievement.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 178], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. P.S. 178 will support parents and 
families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use the Fountas & Pinnell Benchmarks to assess all our students. In addition we use Performance Based Assessments to 
continually monitor literacy and writing development throughout the year. This year, in the Dual language Spanish literacy we 
are beginning to use Evaluacion del Desarrollo de la Lectura (EDL 2) and teacher generated Spanish Performance based 
assessments. According to the November 2015 reading data 20% of grade 1 students are reading on grade level; and students 
on grades 2 - 5 are reading below grade levels. Our data shows that our ELLs specially need extra help with vocabulary 
development and reading fluency.  As a result in our lesson plans we include a vocabulary and language goal.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Paste response to question here: Our schools evaluates the success of our programs for ELLs by looking at all the data we have 
listed in our responses to the prior questions such as by looking at: NYSESLAT scores, Fountas & Pinell benchmark assessments, 
PBAs (Performance Based Assessments) and the quality of student writing as evaluated through our rigorous CCLS aligned 
writing rubrics.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here: Our school uses data to inform all instructional decisions at all levels from classroom 
decisions, program wide, school wide and for specific purposes or populations.   The coach, assistant principals and principal 
meet with teachers on a regular basis during teacher team meetings and grade level meetings to discuss and look at student 
work as well as running records and other assessment data.  Patterns and trends are discussed and strategies created to help 
students build on strengths and improve areas of need. The RtI team meets regularly to discuss and evaluate the progress of 
students receiving RtI.  The RtI groups are flexible and students are rotated in and out of groups in cycles to be no more than 4 
weeks.   During grade meetings we discuss individual student progress to determine whether students are making satisfactory 
progress and determine what new strategies or methods can be employed if they are not moving at a good pace.  Our RtI 
begins by looking closely at how the teachers are scaffolding and differentiating instruction for all students, then progresses to 
Tier 2 instruction outside of the classroom and progresses to Tier 3 for those students that still require more intense 
help.   The native Language is always a main focus of instruction for all ELLs that are Spanish dominant within the students 
classroom and even when they progress to tier 2 & 3.  We employ the Estrellita program and intense help in guided reading in 
Spanish outside of the classroom as well at a more intense level.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Paste response to question here: The data demonstrates that 25% of our ELLs have made progress. The NYSESLAT for the last 
two years have revealed strengths in Speaking across the grades, and writing as the area for instructional focus. Building upon 
the students' oral language development to strengthen the writing in the academic area will be a targeted area. NYSITELL data 
revealed that 83 % of Kindergarten students scored at the Expanding level.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Paste response to questions here: PS 178 offers an integrated and standalone ENL model based on student 
proficiency level and time allotments as per CR Part 154. Currently, our ENL teacher provides both a push in and pull 
out models in grades kindergarten through fifth. Integrated language instruction is provided through a push in model 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

in all grades. The ENL provider plans and co-teaches with grade teams to provide appropriate and differentiated ENL 
strategies so as to ensure students access the CCLS aligned curriculum. The ENL teacher provides at least 180 minutes 
(4-5 blocks) of integrated ENL/ELA during the literacy block and/ or during the content/inquiry  based instruction in 
Social Studies and/or Science (these units integrate all 4 modalities). Literacy data is used to intentionally plan and 
provide best researched based practices and scaffolding strategies that ensure student progress in English language 
acquisition. ENL teacher and CB teacher plan for content and language objectives (the latter reflecting differentiation 
based on level of language proficiency and literacy data). Also, whenever possible, home language is also used to 
ensure transference to target language. Explicit attention is paid to vocabulary development (which impact 
comprehension) throughout the content areas.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here: N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here: Our Dual Language Program offers a 50/50 alternate day model and therefore both 
integrated and standalone ENL instruction is provided during English instruction and instruction is differentiated 
based on student proficiency level and time allotments as per CR Part 154.  All content and literacy instruction in 
English is delivered using ESL methodologies and all instruction is differentiated to support the linguistic and literacy 
diversity in the classrooms. All K-5 students receive literacy instruction and content instruction in the new language 
and the home language.  Classrooms are comprised of heterogeneously mixed ELLs and Non ELLs as peer language 
models are essential for the oral language development of all students.  All dual language instruction occurs in self-
contained classrooms provided by a certified and highly qualified teacher. During ENL instruction, the bilingual 
teacher provides targeted and differentiated ENL strategies and scaffolds for ELLs to ensure language progression. 
Teachers  plan for content and language objectives (the latter reflecting differentiation based on level of language 
proficiency and literacy data).  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              Paste response to questions here: PS 178 uses the guidelines from CR Part 154 to program class schedules and 
student schedules accordingly in STARS, ensuring that all mandated minutes are explicitly accounted for and that these are 
integrated within content area instruction as well as English language skills. We have a literacy block of a minimum of 120 
minutes, which is inclusive or all components of balanced literacy.  
Students in Dual Language Classrooms receive literacy instruction in both languages as Read Alouds, Shared Reading and 
Writing, and Interactive Reading and Writing occur in both languages on a daily basis (through the literacy instruction and 
through content area instruction). In addition ENL/ELA is taught in small group instruction as for Entering and Emerging 
students for a minimum of 1 unit of study (180 min.) For Transitioning students for .5 unit of study (90 min.) a week, and for 
Expanding students 1 unit of study (180 min.) which is incorporated as part of oral language development.  In addition ENL 
integrated instruction is included as part of the literacy block and the content area instruction as teachers plan for content and 
language goals using data and CCLS standards (inclusive all 4 modalities). ENL Stand-Alone is provided for Entering students for 
1 unit of study (180 min.) and Emerging students for .5 unit of study (90 min.)  
Mandated number of minutes for students in ENL “push in and pull” out k-2 programs, are also tracked and scheduled using 
the guidelines from CR Part 154, into the STARS Classroom Programming. ENL instruction and ELA instruction is provided 
during the 120 minutes literacy block and an additional block for ENL for students who are in the Entering, Emerging and 
Transitioning stages. The students receive targeted instructional that builds upon oral language development and English 
literacy skills through explicit teaching addressing all four modalities.  
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

                Paste response here:In the ENL and Dual Language programs, teachers plan intentionally for content, literacy, 
and  language development using the following data: (F&P Benchmark and Evaluacion Del Desarrollo De La Lectura); 
NYSESLAT; our curricula assessments- Ready-Gen, TCRWP Units of Studies, Reading Reform, Estrellita, Maravillas, Inquiry 
based units that integrate literacy and the NYCDOE Scope and Sequence for Science and Social Studies, Go Math Units of 
Studies aligned to CCLS; and knowledge of best literacy and ELL research based practices. We also use NYSELSAT Speaking 
rubrics to assess for oral language development as well. Teacher teams meet to look at student data and work to plan targeted 
instruction to meet the need of our ELLs. 
To support background knowledge and vocabulary, we use an inquiry based approach to learning (thematic / interdisciplinary), 
where students are immersed in hands on experiences through trips, media, visual, and frontloading of vocabulary. We also 
use graphic organizers such as concept maps and semantic maps to support the oral language development and academic 
language. Technology is weaved into the curriculum as a means to differentiate and support all learners in all four modalities. 
Sentence frames and starters (differentiated for various proficiency levels) are provided to support students to engage in 
collaborative conversations. Explicit teaching of Tier 2 words throughout the school allows for the development of academic 
vocabulary for all students.   
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                We use the following assessments:  
        Performance Based Assessments, Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark, Evaluacion Del Desarrollo De La Lectura 2, Estrellita, 
Maravillas, Go Math Chapter Tests (English and Spanish).     
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:As PS 178 expands, this year we have fifth grade students and Developing ELLs  receiving 
services for 4 years or longer. We do not have  SIFE or Long Term ELLs (which require seven years of ELL service) enrrolled in 
the school.  
For our Newcomers, who are potentially the majority of our students, we ensure to provide differentiated instruction as 
teachers intentionally plan for literacy, content, and language development. Entering, Emergent, and Transitioing students are 
provided with daily explicit language instruction in heterogenous and homogenous grouping through shared reading and 
inquiry based tasks that support the targeted linguistic need. This is in addition to the integrated ENL instruction. Teachers 
differentiate by planning for language demands based on analysis of text complexity and student needs for all ELLs. ELLs who 
are in the Advanced and Commanding Stages, are also provided with targeted integrated ENL instruction based on literacy, 
and linguistic data, throughout the content areas and literacy block. In addition, targeted language instruction is provided as 
part of our Saturday Academy Title III program, as students are immersed in rigorous literacy and math units of studies that 
focus on academic language development.  
For students who are Developing ELLs, and students who are potential Developing ELLs,  additional targeted 
instruction/intervention is provided by the ENL or Reading specialist as part of the RTI for ELLs model- Tier 2 services. For 
former ELLs, we provide all supports needed as per their data. Teachers use ENL strategies and scaffolds to ensure students 
have supports needed to access the CCLS aligned units of studies. Former ELLs are provided with ELL strrategies and carefull 
monitoring by their classroom teachers, ENL teacher and assistant principal.  All teachers and concerned staff are informed of 
who the former ELLs are, so that we can ensure that they get preference for intervention or any supports that they are entilted 
to in a timely manner. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

Paste response to question here: In order to meet the needs of all ELLs including SWDs teachers plan for language and literacy 
outcomes for all students in order to provide differentiated instruction. Through flexible grouping, multiple entry points, and 
Universal by Design planning, teachers ensure IEP goals are met. Targeted goals for students include language goals and 
language of instruction as needed, to ensure second language and literacy progression. Teachers use both grade level texts 
with appropriate scaffolds for comprehension, and guided texts based on their level of instruction as per running records and 
F&P benchmark. In addition, teacher teams study and implement strategies for intervention. All students are immersed in 
rigorous CCLS aligned instruction that is developmentally and grade level appropriate. Texts are never "watered down", rather 
the scaffolds place allow for students to access the content.  
Related service providers as well as the ENL teacher, also, provide support through modeling and consulting support.  All 
classrooms contain smartboards, document cameras, visuals, charts, realia and manipulatives that are utilized regulary to 
make content more comprehensible to students.  Students are provided with multiple scaffolding and modifications of lessons 
and tasks to ensure success.  Our school utilizes school moves, yoga, IPad apps and technological supports and software to 
support students at their level of performance or need.           
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Paste response to question here: We offer our ELL-SWDs the least restrictive environment with highly qualified personnel in 
ICT  classrooms as these teacher teams combined, are specialized minimally in special education, bilingual education, early 
childhood education, and ASD Nest.  The ENL teacher provides support to our ELLs in these classes. Our teacher teams provide 
small group and differentiated (targeted) instruction throughout the day to ensure students meet their IEP goals. In addition, 
we have a support staff comprised of an RtI teacher that provides intervention. Our SETSS teacher provides mandated at risk 
services and ensures articulation with all teachers. We have a bilingual speech teacher that provides support as needed. Our 
ENL teacher articulates with service providers and classroom teachers to discuss the progress of our ELL-SWDs. Our SIT 
committee meets on a monthly basis to discuss student progress and supports. There is always a member present that 
understands second language acquisition.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste response to question here: Using guidelines from "Creating an RTI Model for ELLs’ Academic Success",  a document 
written in collaboration with nationally renowned researchers in the field of literacy and language development, we support 
our ELLs under the RTI structure; design research-based instruction that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for ELLs; best 
use assessments to guide daily instruction (Tier I); and best design instructional routines and interventions in Tiers II and III. 
Our Tier I, Core Instruction, includes instruction that supports the needs of our ELLs. Teachers design lessons with language 
obejcetives throughout all content areas. Teachers implictly and explicitly teach vocabulary used in content area studies and 
read alouds. Students have multiple exposures to new vocabulary and through Collaborative Conversations, students have 
opportunities to use those words in context.  
We provided targeted instruction to meet individual students’ needs. For students who are in  Transitioning and Expanding 
levels of proficiency, our literacy data reveals comprehension and phonics instructions needs to be strengthened, we use The 
Fountas & Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention System as a small-group, supplementary literacy intervention as published 
results (2009-10) demonstrate that LLI is an effective short-term intervention for struggling readers who are also classified as 
English Language Learners. We also use double dose of Reading Reform in English and double dose of Estrellita in Spanish. In 
Math, teachers use the Go Math assessments to identify and target specific skills/ strand to focus in on and provide small 
group instruction with progress monitoring.    
   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Paste response to question here: We continue to modify ReadyGen and continue to create a ReadyGen / Writing & Reading 
Workshop fused literacy program.  We like ReadyGen’s close-reading and pushing grade level expectations for 
comprehension.  However, TCRWP is more comprehensive and provides leveling and scaffolding in ways readygen 
doesn't.  Therefore,  even though we opted into ReadyGen we continue to modify it/adapting by filling in the gaps in literacy 
instruction ReadyGen does not address.

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Paste response to question here:  No programs/services will be discontinued  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Paste response to question here: All ELLs are included in all school programs. They all are programmed to participate in the 
arts programs we offer such as: Visual Arts; Dance; Music; Drama. The Art teachers plan for linguistic and cultural 
competencies, as questioning and discussions are intentionally planned for as is awareness of various cultural traditions (which 
are reflective of our families). ELLs are icluded in enrichment programs such as swimming and team sports (soccer, baseball, 
basketball), through our collaboration with Asphalt Green. Dual language classes are scheduled for technology and library. 
Additionally, ELLs participate in Title III enrichment Academy 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Paste response to question here: Technology is integrated into the core curriculm as another vehicle for students to access 
CCLS aligned curriculum. We use Ready Gen, TCRWP in English and Maravillas, Esrellita in Spanish to support literacy 
development.  Students are provided with intentional sentence frames, explicit vocabulary, background knowledge as part of 
the learning experience.  
Students use videos, field trips, big books and non-fiction texts to build their background knowledge and their academic 
vocabulary. The technology teacher and ENL teacher provide students and teachers with resources that are helpful for our 
students. 
Time for Kids is provided for our students in grades 3-5 and for our Transitioning, Advanced, and Commanding ELLs, as the 
texts features support concept and language development. Scholastics magazine is provided for our students in grades K-2 and 
for Entering and Emerging ELLs. In our dual language classes, Ready Gen and Maravillas provide texts in both languages. Go 
Math materials are also provided to all students in both languages. Additional materials for instruction provided for all ELLs 
include, Realia, visuals, charts, flashcards, Ipads, laptops, and smartboards are utilized by all teachers and students to support 
instruction 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Paste response to question here: In our ENL program, the ENL teacher provides second language support to students as 
needed during content and literacy lessons, and classroom teachers provide home language support as 64% of classroom 
teachers speak Spanish.  
In DL programs, there is a 50/50 language allocation, therefore students are provided with ELA, NLA by a fully certified and 
highly qualified bilingual teacher.  ENL instruction and methodologies are provided throughout the day during English days. We 
use an alternating day model and content is taught in both languages.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Paste response to question here:  Our services and support correspond to our ELLs ages and grade levels. For example, 
Estrellita is used in grades K-1, with Kindergarten using it most intensely. Above first grade it is usually used for intensive 
support during Tier II instruction. Second grade is getting more intense support in guided reading in both Spanish and English 
to accelerate their making meaning from text and comprehension.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Paste response to question here: Technology is integrated into the core curriculm as another vehicle for students to access 
CCLS aligned curriculum. We use Ready Gen, TCRWP in English and Maravillas, Esrellita in Spanish to support literacy

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Paste response to question here:  We have several activities in our school to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of 
the school year.  Parents of incoming ELLs are invited to scheduled tours they can sign up for.  The tours are conducted 
bilingually and parents get to participate in a Q & A session afterwards with full translation.  The tours are provided by the 
assistant principals, Diana Barros or Patricia Sanchez and the parent coordinator, Milagros Santos.  Later The principal, Deirdre 
Budd,  holds two meetings for incoming Kindergarten ELL parents.  We give out translated parent guides with tips, support and 
activities to prepare and support them in getting ready for Kindergarten.   Incoming Kindergarten ELL students get to visit their 
future classroom while parents are at the meeting.   In August incoming ELL parents are invited to a picnic with Kindergarten 
teachers, providers and administration, in order to start creating a comfortable inclusive community.   Extra support is 
provided to newcomers, especially those coming in after Kindergarten.  The ENL teacher holds special orientation sessions for 
the newcomers where she gives tours of the school areas, staff and their roles.  During this time they are introduced to the 
staff members and their roles in helping them. The students are, also, given extra support in developing school language and 
procedures.   When they start school they are given a classroom buddy to help their initial transition. All our ELL students 
participate in all support services such as: SETSS, bilingual speech, counseling, physical or occupational therapy as needed or 
mandated.  ELLs fully participate in all curricular and supplemental programs.  Go Math and ReadyGen are the instructional 
programs for all students.  They are implemented in all dual language classrooms in Spanish and English, and with scaffolding 
supports for ELLs in other classrooms.  Students are part of programs that encourage self expression and self 
appreciation.  The Fall Parade encourages a love of reading, language, music, art and culture as the students create costumes, 
learn songs/music, movement and art that represent the characters in their favorite books.  The Science Fair emphasizes 
project exhibits that demonstrate the science concepts students are learning in their classrooms.  The exhibits are in Spanish 
and English for the Dual Language program.  Educational outings are regularly scheduled by grades.  These outings are planned 
to provide learning experiences that reinforce concepts being learned in the classroom.   Furthermore, our Multicultural 
Celebration assembly program is the culmination of a a month long unit of study where students are exposed to other cultures 
and customes. The entire school community celebrates our diversity.  Also, activities and games are planned by teachers and 
parents. All these activities and experiences serve as a tool for additional language development.   ELLs are, also, enrolled in 
the afterschool homework help and extracurricular activities such as: yoga and cooking.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Paste response to question here: We are a K-4 school and offer no electives   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here: Our Dual Language program breaks up the entire curriculum (including 
the literacy block) into a 50% Spanish and 50% English throughout the grades in our school, except for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

Kindergarten.  In order to give the entering EPs and ELLs a boost in Spanish and to support growth in 
Spanish into the higher grades, the Kindergarted is 80% Spanish and 20% English.  The teachers meet 
regularly to plan and map out the units to ensure no overlap or gaps.  Where a need is seen based on 
careful ongoing assessment and monitoring, some students are streamed for additional guided reading 
instruction in their dominant language to target literacy performance below grade level.  This is done to 
support and accelerate their reading performance.  We find this improves their literacy performance in 
their Native Language as well as English.   In our Dual Language program language uses the self-contained 
model, where language is separated through time (alternating days).  We are use content as a way of 
dividing the language and curriculum in order to maintain a 50-50 model of Spanish/English.   Emergent 
literacy is taught simultaneously in both languages, except where a child comes in with no or very little 
pre-literacy skills, or is below grade.  In that case, we stream the child for extra intense guided reading 
instruction in their Native Language until they make adequate progress.  When this happens, they are 
moved back to a 50-50 time model.English Proficient and English Language Learners are integrated 
throughout the entire day in the Dual Language program.   ELLs in monolingual classes are integrated the 
majority of the day, except for the required minutes of ENL they are required to receive.   Therefore, not 
content areas are taught to them in a segregated manner.  This applies to all instructional programs used 
in the classroom as well as extracurricular activities and events.    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Paste response to question here:  The majority of our professional development for our entire staff always includes strategies 
for ELLs and considers ELL special needs.  Some of the professional development includes the following: 
•               Attendance at  Professional Development workshops.  
•               ReadyGen & Go Math training days 
•               Attendance at conferences: Manhattan Field Support Center, DOE, R-BERN, and other organizations  
•               Classroom intervisitations 
•               School intervisitations  
•               Inquiry Groups  
•               Book Clubs 
•               Mentoring 
•               Coaching (in classroom modeling, fish bowl, etc  
Paste response to question here: All staff, including Bilingual, ENL and staff related to ELLs will attend weekly professional 
development. Some of the topics include: 
1. September 8, 2015  “Intervisitations: Planning for all students including ELLs”       
2. November 2, 2015 “STARS Classroom and ELLs” 
4.  November 23, 2015 “Creating an RTI Model for ELLs’ Academic Success” 
5. December 14, 2015 “Collaborative Conversations: Implications for ELLs” 
6. January 25, 2015    “Integrating Technology in to the Go Math curriculum to support ELLs” 
  
In addition, all teachers will participate in all literacy training sessions with literacy coach and assistant principals where 
they  will acquire best teaching practices for ELLs.  The assistant principals, principal and coach attend network and  DOE 
trainings which they turn-key to the staff.  In addition, teachers are sent to select workshops throughout the year.  
All teachers that do not hold an ENL or bilingual license have attended in house workshops provided by the Manhattan Field 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

Support Center/R-BERN/DOE workshops to complete 10 hours of ENL training.  New teachers are advised of this requirement 
at the start of their employment and the school secretary files all documentation/certificates in their file in the main office.      
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Paste response to question here:•  Grade level teacher meeting to support and prepare students as they move into middle 
school. 
•               Guidance Councelor meets with staff to provide information regarding the middle school process. 
•               To inform staff about which middle schools provide Dual Language and Bilingual services to students and parents. 
•               We invite middle school staff to come and talk about their school. 
•               Administration and counselors work with teachers in advising and guiding how to best prepare students for middle 
school.   
Paste response to question here:In-house professional development sessions address ENL instruction as follows: Dual 
Language, content area and ENL teachers  meet on a monthly basis, to plan ENL instruction and supports for all ELLS. The Dual 
Language Vertical Team meets to design and refine ENL and Home Language instruction school-wide as well as ensuring best 
practices are being implemented across grades to meet the demands of Common Core Instruction for all ELLs in both 
languages (Spanish & English).  
Our school is dedicated to providing in-house PD sessions designed by experts in their areas in order to ensure all staff are 
exposed to the most current research and are applying this knowledge to their instruction. In addtion to our in-house PD 
sessions, teachers are informed of, and encouraged to attend, proven source PD sessions offered through the DOE, thus 
ensuring our staff is kept fully abreast of current best practices for ELL instruction in langauge and content areas.      
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here: All parents of ELLs receive orientation about their program model during Curiculum Night. 
We ensure our parents undertsand our goals, expectations, and services for students for their language development 
throughout the disciplines. In addition, our parents of ELLs have at least 1 additional data conferences (aside from parent 
orientation and PTC) to discuss their child's progress for  language development. Data sources from NYSELSLAT, Evaluacion Del 
Desarrollo De La Lectura 2, Estrellita, Maravillas, F&P, Go Math Assessments, and other formative assessments are interpreted 
and shared to demonstrate students' academic progress and students' language development. In addition, translation services 
are used when we do not have representatives form our school who speak that language. These meetings with the ENL 
provider and classroom teacher (during Tuesday Parent Engagement Time) during the month of January. 
The bilingual parent coordinator works closely with administration, teachers and parents to create opportunities for parents to 
provide feedback and address questions or concerns. She ensures that all meetings are translated. She does regular outreach 
to ELL parents through enail, phone calls, letters, and through the Remind app. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Paste response to question here:  Parents at PS 178 have many opportunities to be involved in school activities. We have a 
program called Book Pals that is run by the parents with the ELL assistant principal. Parent volunteer on a scheduled basis to 
read to classrooms on Friday mornings. We have both English and Spanish speaking readers that read on a regualr basis.  
We have a very active Parent Association, that create activities and events for all parents and students. Every Friday parents 
are welcomed to have coffe and chat.  During Saturday Academy for ELLs parents participate in different types of workshops 
and activities. We strengthen family involvement through fun, engaging family activities such as  
•               T.I.G.E.R. Day (Together in Getting Everyone Reading) 
•               Pajama Day

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Deirdre Budd, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
