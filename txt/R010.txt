Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S. 10, Fort Hill Collaborative Elementary School‘s mission is to prepare students to become leaders who leverage 
effective habits to ensure social, emotional and academic success. We believe students learn best when they are 
provided with collaborative learning experiences where they can demonstrate the application of their knowledge 
through hands-on projects. We use and model higher order questioning to promote student critical thinking and 
multiple approaches to problem-solving; utilize "lab" investigations to give them real-world experiences and 
opportunities to work cooperatively; and integrate habits which develop personal leadership skills and live our core 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

values of respect, responsibility and collaboration. We will foster a love of learning and discovery through 
interdisciplinary projects that emphasize Mathematics and the Sciences.  

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 10, Fort Hill Collaborative Elementary School is a Title I elementary school in its fifth year of development. We are 
located in the Tompkinsville section of Staten Island. For the 2018- 2019 school -year we are serving kindergarten, 
first ,second grade, third grade and fourth grade students and will grow yearly until we are a kindergarten to fifth 
grade school. Our staff consists of seventeen full-time teachers, nine paraprofessionals, one full time guidance 
counselor, a two day psychologist and social worker, F Status assistant principal, a school aide and a secretary. We 
have ten classes, with a total enrollment of 183 students. 

Approximately 30% of our students have been identified as English Language Learners and 34% have been identified 
as Students with Disabilities. The needs of these two special and diverse populations are varied. According to our 
latest NYSESLAT results our ELL students are making gains in the area of listening and speaking. This is attributed to 
the grand conversations students are engaging in within the classroom. Students participate in a daily morning 
meeting to build conversations and community. Structures, such as turn and talk and think-pair- shares are embedded 
into daily lessons. Vocabulary development is supported through word walls with visuals. Our ELL students are not 
making comparative gains in the sub test of reading and writing. Due to this the teachers will participate in on-going 
professional development in order to analyze trends and develop instructional techniques that will enhance these 
areas. Our Students with Disabilities population are within related services, ICT and 12:1:1 models of instruction. 
many of them require more individualized instruction and social-emotional support so that they may persevere within 
the task set forth for them.  

In our fifth year we are going to continue to collaborating and partnering with: 

 

  Orton Gillingham- Teachers will be teaching early literacy through phonics based approaches alongside multi-
sensory techniques of learning. This approach assists in improving students’ ability to read write and spell. All 
staff attends a Reading Reform course on Saturdays and over the summer to become certified on this 
approach.  
Leader in Me: Is a whole school transformation model that supports students, staff and parents social 
emotional development. This model is based on the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and enables students 
to develop leadership skills through the teaching and embedding of the habits in their school routines and 
instruction. The introduction of this model will occur throughout the first three years of the schools 
establishment. However, the 7 Habits will be utilized every year embedded in instruction and daily routines. 
The Habits are reinforced through the daily Responsive Classroom Morning Meeting which is programmed in 
the schedule everyday from 8:20 A.M. to 8:45 A.M. 

  Responsive Classroom: is a way of teaching that emphasizes social, emotional, and academic growth in a 
strong and safe school community. Developed by classroom teachers, the approach consists of practical 
strategies for helping students build academic and social competencies-cooperation, assertiveness, 
responsibility, empathy, and self-control and a set of academic competencies- academic mindset, 
perseverance, learning strategies, and academic behaviors day in and day out. 

We are also proud to continue our newest collaborations for 2018-2019: 

 

LINC- Blended Learning- We have partnered with LINC in order to create a transformation team in regards to 
Blended Learning and personalization of instruction for students. LINC will lead the team to create lab sites.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

  Disney Musical in the Schools: This grant was received in the 2017-2018 school year and it provided our 

students with the opportunities to be introduced to theatrical arts. Our third grade students embarked on an 
18 week collaboration with Disney teaching artists which culminated with them performing the LION KING 
Kids at the school and on Broadway. Students for th 2018-2019 school year will have the opportunity to select 
another Disney Musical to dissect and perform. 

  NTN Mathematics: NTN mathematics provides our teachers an opportunity to engage with best practices in 

mathematics led by a on site coach. This professional development will span the course of the year and 
partner P.S. 10 with with other district schools so that we can share our learning experiences an our best 
practices in order to get our 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade teachers ready for A4A. 

  Core Collaborative: Core Collaborative will provide on-going professional development for 6 teachers in the 

area of Literacy, specifically around building assessment capable learners. This professional development will 
allow teachers to unpack the standards so that they may be better equipped to differentiate for diverse needs 
of students. 

  N.I.A. Community Services Network: N.I.A is our CBO partnership for student extended day programs. NIA’s 

comprehensive after-school programs provide participants with new skills and enrichment that help them 
grow into well-rounded and confident adults. We offer a safe, encouraging, and stimulating environment 
where youth can receive academic support, explore new things, and cultivate character and a positive self 
image. NIA employs a holistic approach to help each youth develop his or her capabilities by designing 
activities that integrate positive youth development principles and skill development that broaden student 
abilities and support their emotional, social, academic, creative, and physical development. Youth provide 
input and actively participate in the planning, design, and implementation of our programs, an experience 
that both enhances their skills and contributes to building programs that are effective and relevant to their 
needs and aspirations. 

The extended day program will provide activities such as: 

 

 
o  Academic Enrichment 
o  Daily Homework Support 
o  STEM 
o  Arts Education – Like Music, Drama, Dance, and Visual Arts 
o  Physical Education – Including sports, active games, and fitness 
o  Photography 
o  Gardening 
o  Cooking 
o  Character Education 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special Education - (SWD) 

ICT classes in grades Kindergarten through Fourth Grade. The SWD students in the ICT classes need to improve in 
academics, especially in the area of literacy. Data from the 3rd Grade State ELA exam reported that the students in 
12:1:1 did not score proficient. 7 of the 17 students tested scored a level 1, 8 students of the 17 scored a level 2 and 2 
of the 17 students scored a level 3. These 6 students are 3 levels or more behind their peers in terms of grade 
appropriate reading levels. The specific needs of this subgroup is in comprehension of text read. The students are able 
to decode but are hindered when trying to make meaning of the text they have decoded. 

As far as Math data, 6 students of 17 scored level 1, 1 student of 17 scored level 2, 8 students of the 17 scored level 3 
and 2 of the 17 scored a level 4. It is evident that the SWD subgroup has a higher level of proficiency in mathematics. 
Those who did not score proficient are students having difficulty in reading comprehension and thus math 
comprehension of a word problem.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year , our school has had many accomplishments including establishing a supportive environment and 
collaborative teachers and staff. We have forged a successful collaboration with our co-located school P.S. 16. We 
have maximized our instructional program by sharing the Robin Hood Library, school librarian, and the physical 
education teacher. Book fairs and other activities are done building wide so that our community families who have 
children in both schools have cohesiveness.  

Each member of our staff has adopted and aligned their personal educational philosophies with the mission of the 
school and we have created a culture that there are high expectations for all members of the school community. We 
have various opportunities throughout the month for parent involvement, including Families Fostering Success 
volunteers, Parents as Partner Fridays, Parent Monthly Academic Based Workshops and our monthly community 
service activities. 

Some challenges thus far have been in engaging all parents in our school events and activities, behavioral issues, as 
well as chronic absenteeism. In order to address these challenges we have decided to continue to focus on building 
trust within our school community. Through developing trusting relationships we aspire to build a community in 
which parents understand the value of the quality of instruction our students are receiving, the connection between 
engagement and student behavior and the importance of being present daily.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
At P.S.10 students are engaged in classroom activities and curriculum is rigorous. 2018-2019 State Testing Data 
indicates that 68% of all third grade students scored proficient on the mathematics exam. Males scored 77% 
proficient where as females scored 58% proficient. SWD's scored 58.8% proficient and MLLs scored 69% proficient.  

In Literacy, 44% of all third grade students tested scored proficient (Level 3 and 4). Males scored 40% proficient and 
with our Females 47% scored proficient. SWD's 12% scored proficient and MLL's scored 0% proficient.  

NYC 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey Results indicate: 

  88% of the teachers say that students feel challenged in the area of ELA 
  100% of the teachers of all subjects say that they had the resources to include opportunities for reading and 

writing experiences grounded in evidence from text.  

School Strengths: Instructional Core 

● 1.1 - Curriculum - The curricula are aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and integrate instructional shifts in 
math. Curricula and tasks consistently emphasize rigorous habits across grades and subject areas. Unit maps and 
lesson plans reflect tasks that promote higher-order thinking and college and career readiness for all students. 

School Needs:  

  Hone in on the subgroup of females for mathematics and MLL students for ELA, to ensure that the these 

students are achieving equivalent to their peers.  

  1.2- Pedagogy - Teaching strategies need more consistently to provide multiple entry points in challenging 

tasks reflective in student work product and student discussions during group work and investigations. Across 
classrooms, there is a need for opportunities for cognitive engagement which will result in more even levels 
of thinking and participation. 

  2.2 Assessment - Need to develop ongoing opportunities for student to student discussions, effective 

assessment practices using checks for understanding and self- assessment. Also actionable feedback and 
consistent adjustments based on student learning needs employed across classrooms.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 80% of teachers in grades K-4 will deepen their pedagogical strategies such as creating standards based 
student tasks that increase student engagement and discussion as measured by Danielson components 3B, 3C and 3D.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Classroom teachers, MLL. teachers, and Special Education 
providers will engage in grade level curriculum mapping to 
embed higher order thinking strategies, questions and tasks. This 
work will be focused around the progression of the common 
core standards. 

Based on teacher observations of pedagogy, professional 
development will be aligned to meet teacher needs. Individual 
and school wide professional development will be planned 
around designing tasks and higher level thinking and discussion 
opportunities. this will be achieved through collaboration and 
partnerships with an Orton-Gillingham approach to teaching 
early literacy through phonics based approaches alongside multi-
sensory techniques of learning.School Wide will provide 
professional development in the area of literacy, focusing on the 
early elementary reading and writing. N.I.A. a community 
services network partnership after school program, provides 
students with new skills and enrichment that help them grow 
into well-rounded and confident adults. 

Teachers will collaborate on unit and lesson plans to design 
activities that engage all students in rigorous tasks, embedded in 
well-crafted instructional units and with appropriate supports. 
Teachers will implement rigorous, explicit instruction with 
specific guided practice (Guided Reading, Shared Reading, 
Shared Writing) to push for independence. In addition they will 
continue to implement the reciprocal teaching model.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Analyzing community trends there is a need to support students both socially and emotionally, in order for them to 
achieve academically. There are structures in place to create a positive environment and inclusive culture that leads 
to student success. The school is located in a large Title I community and through parent workshop discussions, P.TA. 
meetings and S.L.T discussions, it became evident that parents wanted support with everyday life topics in addition to 
academics.  

The 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey Indicates that 95% of the parents have trust in the teachers and 
principal of the school and 92% of the parents feel the school is a safe environment for the students.  

School Strengths:  

  Classroom environment support group work and collaborative learning. 
 
  Teachers know all students by name and their needs through collaborative conversations. Daily morning 

Lesson and unit planning embed checks for understanding to gage student mastery of topics. 

meeting ensures an environment of support and collaboration. 

  Teachers use inter-visitation to support each other and lend expertise to support student environment 

 
 
 

 

(pineapple project). 
Students learn and embed the 7 Habits of Happy Kids in their daily learning and it is used to set goals. 
School Needs:  
Select students are frequently absent (average attendance 90%) and/or late which leads to an inconsistency 
in academic progress due to missing instruction. 
 Home- school connection in relation to behavioral expectations and progressive discipline. Reduce incident 
rate from approximately 500 reports yearly. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the

Social/Emotional development through the use of creative 
play and advisement will be supported by guidance counselor 
and service providers. This will reinforce socializing skills by 
allowing students to work and collaborate in groups. By 
working with their classmates they will explore and build 
upon different social skills needed for future experiences. 

Social emotional support will be conducted by a behavior 
management specialist. The specialist will work with 
classroom teachers to embed positive behavior strategies in 
all aspects of the school day such as morning meeting, lesson 
activities and classroom routine and rituals. PBIS Team will 
provide classroom supports. They will provide PD to staff from 
November through June. 

A guidance counselor will facilitate counseling sessions for 
mandated and "at risk" students in order to provide them 
with coping and resilience strategies as well as whole classes 
based on needs assessments ( conflict resolution, 
homelessness).

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
● High-quality and ongoing professional development, aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards, is utilized 
to support our teaching staff. Teachers are surveyed with a self-assessment on strengths and areas of concern. 
Professional Development will then be aligned to support both areas of strengths and concerns through carefully 
selected professional development opportunities. 

● Professional Development will be provided before the opening of the school to ensure buy-in and that all teachers 
understood the schools mission and philosophy. Monthly professional development is scheduled cyclically to monitor 
the pulse of the schools mission and culture.  

● Professional Development for schools’ curricula and special programs will be provided by professional sources and 
lead teachers being certified in these programs such as Reading Reform, Lego Education, and Leader in Me and Core 
Knowledge. Monthly professional development is scheduled cyclically to monitor the pulse of the schools curricula 
and special programs and their impact on student achievement.  

● Mentors are assigned to support new and un-qualified teachers.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Teachers, paraprofessionals and administration meet weekly for professional development opportunities. 
Professional development is aligned to school goals and observational feedback. Teachers also have scheduled 
common preparation periods at least two times a week in which they can common plan units of study as well as meet 
for inquiry team. Inter-visitations of classrooms are encouraged and best practices are shared among teachers and 
paraprofessionals. Outside consultants and coaches, School Wide, Leadership Academy, Leader in Me organization 
and District 31 also provide professional development opportunities for administration and staff. 

 

The strategies that we use for recruitment to ensure that the staff is highly qualified is as follows:

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 10, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

P.S. 10, Fort Hill Collaborative Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students

Based on the 2017-2018 ELA and Math Assessment Data, English Language Learners scored as 
follows: 
Level 3 
(Proficient) 
Level 4 
(Proficient) 
The purpose of the Title III Program is to provide an extended year opportunity (extended day 2x 
a week)  for English Learners in grade 3  and 4 to develop the academic language necessary to 
succeed in all content areas, with a special focus on the academic language of reading, 
mathematics, and science. This program is specifically designed for English Learners at the 
expanding and transitional levels of language proficiency that need additional reading and 
writing  support to be successful in school. Our data shows that our ELL students are functioning 
better academically in the area of mathematics as compared to reading and writing. Guided 
reading and comprehension will be the focus of our program. We will also embed mathematics 
to ensure their mathematical comprehension and fluency increases. Mathematics instruction will 
include problem solving, mathematical games, fluency drills and small guided 
groupings.  Students will be grouped for instruction based on the skill item analysis report data 
which will indicate the students needs. 
The Title III Program will meet 2x a week from 2:45 P.M. to 4:45 P.M.  The program will 
tentatively start in January and end in late May. It will run for 20 weeks. It will serve 35-40 ELL 
Students. Instruction will be in English. There will be three certified ENL teachers providing the 
instruction for group of 10 students. Materials such as, Triumph Learning for reading and 
mathematics will be purchased for individual students.

May . The pd cycle will be focused on deciphering the standards for ELA and Math and best 
practices on task  development/scaffolding instruction for ELLs.  All teachers at P.S. 10 will 
receive professional development in these areas because students are in all classes and this 
analysis of best practices is best if all teachers were engaged in this type of work. 
Teachers will be involved in the NTN math pd and Divide and Conquer PD 1x per month for an 
all day session. They will visit other schools for best practices and be engaged with the coach in

Monthly workshops will be held for parents regarding specific academic areas that students are 
engaging in daily. These workshops will allow parents a hand on opportunity to engage with 
curricula and best practices on how to assist their students at home. Workshops will be held in 
English and Spanish (predominant language of ELLS at 10). The workshops will also give 
strategies on how to assist students in developing comprehension in the native language and how 
that development translates to them being able to transfer skills over to the second language. 
Parents are notified of these workshops in various ways. Flyer's and classroom newsletters are 
distributed in English and Spanish, they are indicated on the monthly calendar(which is sent in 
both English and Spanish). School Messenger is used to send home calls to remind parents of the 
upcoming workshops.  Agendas and handouts are maintained in our parent outreach binder. 
Students home language from the home language survey assists in enabling us to decide parents 
preferred language for communication.

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Other than the NYSESLAT, New York State does not mandate that students below grade three participate in standardized 
testing.  Instead, schools have the opportunity to choose their own assessment tool to gauge early literacy skills. At P.S. 10 we 
use the Reading Reform Orton Gilliangham Approach and Fountas and Pinnell Running Records.   These programs offer a 
number of assessments to support our teachers in this critical work.  Our students are assessed in Concepts of Print (for 
emergent readers), Letter-Sound Identification, High-frequency Words, and for their independent reading levels in fiction and 
non-fiction text.   
After analyzing the data from the Concepts of Print and  Letter Recognition we have come to realize that students identified as 
being ELLs are performing close to their native English counterparts.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

On site consultant for Orton Gillingham which analyzes students data and plans targeted instruction with the classroom 
teachers including small group opportunities for ELL students. Lesson planning reflects adjustments made for ELL students 
including explicit vocabulary development. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
P.S 10 is a school in its fifth year of development, therefore AYP was not established in 2014-2015, 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. 
At P.S. 10 ELLs success is evaluated based on hard and soft data; including tasks and benchmark assessments.   In order to 
provide our English Language Learners with a standards-based, quality education, the P.S. 10 community will align all programs 
with the Common Core State Standards in all content areas , implement effective monitoring and assessment, provide 
professional development opportunities for all our teachers in effective practices that meet the needs of our students who are 
at various proficiencies in English language learning, and keep communication lines open with all our families and inform them 
of the school’s expectations and instructional practices.       
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Data collected is analyzed every 8 weeks to make overall instructional modifications. Data specific to ELL students is analyzed 
to monitor the growth compared to the non-ell data. Teachers use daily formative assessments in their lessons to monitor 
student understanding and to adjust as needed. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
For each ELL student who scores below specified levels of performance on  the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT , we determine the 
additional support services to provide the student , taking into consideration evidence such as, number of year instruction in 
the bilingual education or English as a second language program, English and home language literacy, content area and socio-
emotional support needs of students with inconsistent of interrupted formal education (SIFE) 
Students in K-3 who score below grade level on benchmark assessments for ELA through Reading Reform nd Fountas and 
Pinnell are provides with RTI services. Students will receive a pre test and then the student will be given six weeks of small 
group intervention. After the six weeks a post test will be given to evaluate progress.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
As a school in its year fourth year of completion we have begun to notice that  students are maintaining their NYSESLAT level 
or increasing by at least one level a year. 
Our first year of testing in 3rd grade 13 (ELLS) ELA and Math resulted in the following: 
0% of ELLS scoring Proficient in ELA (9out of 13 scored level 2) 
69% of ELLs scoring Proficient in Math 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Structures such as ELL meetings and professional development for all teachers focusing on the needs of our particular ELL 
students and not ELL students in general. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

As per Part CR 154, there are two types of ENL: 
1. Stand alone ENL service is delivered by certified ENL teacher. 
2. Integrated Instruction is delivered in a CTT model. Entering and Emerging students receive 80 minutes of integrated 
ESL a week. In contrast Transitioning students receive only 90 minutes of integrated and 90 minutes of stand alone 
instruction. Advanced placed students receive 180 minutes within ELA or any content area, Finally commanding 
students receive 90 minutes integrated instruction weekly for 2 years after testing out.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

The TBE Kindergarten ICT meets students at their level. This current TBE program has 50 % English and 50 % Spanish 
instruction.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Freestanding ENL- P.S. 10 employs three TESOL certified teachers. One of which is working under her TESOL license. We 
have a 2 self contained ENL classrooms. Students are grouped heterogeneously into the designated ENL class. Students not in 
the self contained class receive pull out or push in services as required based the language acquisition level.  In both models of 
instruction teachers present the same task using multiple entry points to scaffold their progress allowing students to approach 
it in their own way. In a addition support materials that correspond to the classroom curriculum are utilized. This may include 
graphic organizers, educational websites, books and regalia gathered by the teachers/ ENL methodologies such as whole 
language, cooperative learning and total physical response are employees throughout the program. Scaffolding techniques are 
used when learning core-curriculum material. ENL services are available for this school year in Kindergarten through 3rd 
grade.  Grade. As the school adds on grade the services will be offered K - 5.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    Actively engaging students in differentiated tasks as well as fostering the depth of instructions to increase independence 
across all content areas is the focus of our work this year.  Teachers use investigations and the workshop model in all content 
areas. This encompasses a mini lesson, independent small/group instructional nd whole class share. Our small group 
instruction utilizes data to drive instructional goals for the students. It focuses on the individual needs of the students.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   The students who are eligible for ENL services and whose native language is Spanish are administered the Spanish LAB-R 
upon registration. As a K-1 school NYS standardized exams are not administered, however MOSL exams in are offered in Native 
language and when applicable classroom and summative exams are offered in native language.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction for different groups are as follows: 
SIFE, Students receiving 4- 6 years of services and Newcomers will receive targeted instruction through guided reading, small 
group skill and strategy lessons and one on on conferencing with the classroom teacher. These teaching methods allow 
teachers to meet children at their level of proficiency and guide and coach them to greater levels of proficiency. Teachers will 
use Fountas and Pinnell as a diagnostic tool to track progress in reading and to match readers with just right books. Fountas 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

and Pinnell teacks a students reading progress. It measures their accuracy, reading rate, fluency and comprehension. SIFE and 
students receiving services 4-6 years will be closely monitored by the classroom teacher.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Some instructional strategies found to be most effective when educating ELL students with disabilities include but are not 
limited to using graphic organizers, visual representations, explicit modeling, role-playing, total physical response activities, 
think pair share, flexible grouping, and technology programs to enrich curriculum. Materials used with these strategies are 
grade and English proficiency level appropriate. they include independent leveled readers, personal word walls, student used 
check lists, highlighters ans post-its.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 In order ot meet the needs of our ELLs identified as having disabilities, our staff is comprised of various support specialists, this 
includes a bilingual psychologist, bilingual physical therapist, bilingual speech providers and bilingual paraprofessionals.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered.

The upcoming school year we will have a full time ENL provider dedicated. This position will help support students as well as 
provide ENL support for non TESOL licensed teachers. We have added a STEM extended day program over the past to years 
targeted for ELL students and partnered with SOLAR One through Title III funding. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

In 2014-2015 we had a bilingual ICT class. That section has since been closed due to not having bilingual students with IEPs to 
fill class. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development opportunities will be offered to our entire staff in implementing ENL teaching methodologies 
because English Language Learners are in every classroom and every teacher needs to have an understanding of ENL strategies 
such as scaffolding, modeling, TPR, the use of manipulatives, visuals, technology, authentic texts, and planning thematic units 
of study. 
  
During the school year, ongoing professional development will be provided for ESL, bilingual, and monolingual teachers as well 
as school administrators. In addition to P.S. 10 personnel, district and central ELL administrators will be invited to attend and 
participate in all professional development meetings. The professional development will include study groups, conferences, 
school inter-visitations and workshops based on second language acquisition theories and methodologies of high quality 
teaching practices for LEP students. We are continuing to conduct on-going professional development to meet the required 
minimum 7.5 hours of ELL training for all staff, other than those who hold ESL and bilingual licenses as per Jose P.  
An itemized analysis of school professional development regarding ELLs proceeds as follows: 
1. Experts on the staff conduct workshops for their peers in utilizing best practices for instructing English Language Learners.  
2. Common planning time for teachers where they plan together and share best practices with their colleagues.  
3. Opportunities for teachers to visit other schools who are implementing successful practices for English Language Learners.  
4. Opportunities for teachers to attend district, and city workshops.   
5. Opportunities for teachers to observe, to plan, and to be coached by specialists in the areas of reading, writing, and math.  
Professional Development is offered throughout the school year based on surveys and classroom observation of pedagogy. 
The  Borough Facility Structure will also offer professional development training for teachers.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Professional Development is assessed through teacher surveys and is met by in-house and district level PD to address 
desired outcomes. Teachers of ENL students turn key PD's on during staff development time for their colleagues and serve as 
model teachers for inter-visitation.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jennifer Gonzalez-Funes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities 
are adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Based on the data collected from the HLIS, ATS reports and in-take at registration, we are able to assess parent 
language preference. To the best of our ability and capability, we provide translators at the counter upon 
registration to ensure that parents are provided information accurately. We specifically request that parents 
select how they prefer both oral and written communication on their emergency contact cards and HILS survey 
form. The blue contact cards are compiled in the main office as well as with the classroom teachers. All staff are 
informed and regularly supported in appropriate communication with all parents in order to ensure that 
necessary and important information is shared.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

How do you plan to translate? Include 
procedures to ensure timely provision 
of translated documents to parents.  

Since our largest population has 
indicated Spanish as their language of 
preference, all communication 
distributed to families is sent home in 
both English and Spanish. If parents 
request in their home language, other 
than Spanish, we do the best of our 
ability to ensure that proper 
communication in their language 
provided. Written translation services 
for documents such as letters, notices, 
flyer's, permission slips, consent forms, 
parent handbooks, hearings, 
suspension letters and any other 
information needed to be 
disseminated to an ELL parent or any 
other written communication will be 
provided in their native language 
whenever possible. Translations are 
completed by school staff members or 
we utilize the services provided by the 
NYCDOE Translation Department. To 
ensure timely provision documents 
needed for translation are translated a 
week before the document needs to 
be distributed. Therefore all

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Our school messenger system translates messages into 20 different languages based on ATS information. In other 
cases we utilize the Doe translation and Interpretation Division. We also have staff that can communicate in Spanish, 
Russian, Arabic and Italian.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

Staff members are trained in a yearly PD on Chancellor's Regulation A-663. Information is distributed and posters and 
reference sheets are made available around the school. All teachers have the translations email and phone number.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Translation is provided as deemed necessary from ATS and other in-take documentation as well as when parents 
specifically request support. We will continue to translate all notifications based on parent preference both written 
and orally. The parent coordinator and ENL staff will consistently document and support parent translations as 
needed.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parent surveys will be utilized as well through SLT and PTA measures of communication in order to ensure all families 
are supported and provided the necessary language access across written and verbal means of communication.
