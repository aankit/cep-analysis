Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality

Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify 

the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content 
standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 
It is the mission of The Albert Einstein Middle School to work together in excellence to provide all students with a 
college and career preparatory curriculum based on their unique individual academic and social-emotional needs. Our 
aim is to work closely with every member of our educational community, to engage every child intellectually, socially 
and emotionally. We guide our students on their quest for excellence in order to achieve greatness in high school, 
college and beyond. 

 

 
2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including 

a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented. 

The Albert Einstein Intermediate School 131 is a Middle School with approximately 500 students from grade six 
through grade eight. The school is located in the Soundview section of the Bronx. To help us achieve our mission our 
students are engaged in rigorous activities as well as a wide array of extracurricular activities that are offered to all of 
our students. In order to support our emphasis on the Common Core Learning Standards, we utilize a scheduling 
system, which allows for teachers to common plan and engage in inquiry work throughout the week. We parallel 
program our self-contained classes along with general education classes allowing for easy transition into a Least 
Restrictive Environment (LRE). We have strong collaborations with Core Ready/Litlife, National Training Network 
(NTN), Ramapo, and Teacher's College (TC) , These collaborations offer professional development for our teachers to 
maximize instruction for our students and provide social-emotional intelligence. The SRT and Astor Clinic programs 
will support the development of relationships between parents and community resources in order to enable the 
social, emotional health of our at risk students. 

As a school, I.S. 131, through our partnership with our community school director, and community based 
organization, ASPIRA, we celebrate the Arts and exist to provide every student with a forum for artistic expression and 
appreciation within an academic environment. Opportunities exist for every student to develop mastery of at least 
one creative talent, we offer visual art, band and dance. Through our Broadway Junior Grant, we will have another 
successful theatre arts production for the 2018-2019 school year. We strive to nurture our students as we encourage 
their artistic potential and interests through a rigorous standards-based program. I.S. 131’s main focus is to assist 
each student in attaining reading, writing, thinking, listening and speaking skills on or above grade level, as well as to 
develop an appreciation for the Visual and Performing Arts. 

IS 131 strives to meet the needs of the “whole child”. The school has systems in place to identify our students at risk 
academically, emotionally and behaviorally. Through the Bronx Field Support Center and the Special Education School 
Improvement Specialist (SESIS), weekly meetings are held, whereby all community stakeholders attend, to identify 
students and create plans around them to best meet their specific needs. Through SESIS, professional development is 
provided to our special education teachers as well as any other staff members that may need support. We have three 
Guidance Counselors who, besides meeting the needs of mandated students’, also provide services to at risk students 
who are in crisis. These at risk groups can include students with academic, social or emotional needs. 

 
3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school population comprises 61.8% Hispanic, 33.2% Black, and 3% Asian or Hawaiian/PI, and 1% Native American 
and 1% Caucasian. The student body includes 10% English Language Learners and 38% Special Education students. 
Boys account for 49% of the students enrolled and girls account for 51%. The average attendance rate for this school 
year is 92.9%. The ELL and Special Education population need specific scaffolding and strategies to make content 
accessible for them. We offer Integrated Co-Teaching classes, Special Education Teacher Support Services (SETSS), 
12:1 and 12:1:1 classes to meet the specific needs of the special education students, including a 12:1 grade 7-8 bridge

We utilize push in and pull out English as a Native Language (ENL) services to meet the specific needs of the varying 
language development of our English Language Learners. We service ELL students in Spanish, Wolof, Arabic, Fulani, 
Bengali, and Niger-Congo.  

 

4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the 

past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most progress was in solidifying the curricula 
that is in place and institution of certain curriculum for collaboration among middle schools in the district. 

Last year’s instructional focus was to adjust our professional practice to ensure that subgroups of students received 
the support they needed to thrive academically and emotionally.  

Our 2018-2019 instructional focus is, "increasing student achievement by improving instructional differentiation 
through ongoing data-driven inquiry." Our focus this year is to add the use of data to adjust our professional practice. 
Our data analysis, both qualitative and quantitative, will be used to inform instructional expertise. We will analyze 
formative data to identify patterns of strengths and needs and use the insights highlighted to develop goals and 
objectives that can drive the school improvement. We will be utilizing IO Education and IO Assessment for the 
collection of data and District Public for data analysis. 

 

5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the 

instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards; 
provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year. 

The Turnaround Principle to be implemented in the 2018-2019 school year is: Using data to inform instruction for 
continuous improvement. We will incorporate 6-8 week Inquiry RTI cycles, beginning Oct. 2018, focusing on 
pushable/slipable Level 1 / Level 2 students, and ELL's where teachers will teach specific skills and/or standards in ELA 
and Math. We will continue to implement our "Focus Friday" into our instructional program beginning biweekly in 
October 2018 and weekly beginning in February 2019, where teachers will re-teach focused concepts and standards 
and then students will be assessed to show progress towards mastery of the standard. We will continue to implement 
"Power Hour" beginning in Feb. 2019 to April 2019 to provide additional support towards mastery for the NYS ELA and 
Math exam. Teachers will use that data to then plan for next weeks differentiated instruction for the students. The 
data will be tracked and monitored throughout the year using IO Assessment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Reflection: 

According to our 2017-18 Principal Performance Observation (PPO), an area of celebration was our thorough Response 
to Intervention Plan that is multifaceted in both ELA and Mathematics and our partnership with District Public to analyze 
our school-wide data to create groups of slipable and pushable students. An area of focus was for the teachers to align 
to the instructional focus of the school and for the classrooms to reflect data driven instruction. Pedagogy in the 
classroom must be improved by having a more thorough feedback process and a more developed professional 
development plan. In our 2017-2018 Advance summary report indicated that 62% of teachers scored a developing rating 
in indicator 3d on the Danielson Framework, which serves as a driver for our current professional development plan. 

 

Strengths: 

The school’s professional collaboration and distributed leadership structures have strengthened the instructional 
capacity of teachers as well as their involvement in school decision making across the school. Teachers have

implemented a comprehensive system for using formative and summative assessments that involve student reflection 
and tracking of student learning. On the 2018 NYSCC exams, the school increased proficiency in ELA by 10%. In Math, 
the school showed gains of 11% in math proficiency as well reduced Level 1s by 2%. 

Needs Improvement: 

As a school we were successful in creating a comprehensive system for using formative and summative assessments to 
drive student achievement. In our classrooms we have noticed that students are not yet able to demonstrate mastery of 
daily grade level learning tasks, and many of our students are still not proficient in Math and ELA. We now need to begin 
a deeper analysis of the data by grade and teacher, and strengthen our curricula and tasks for providing more 
differentiation for individual learners. We will focus on differentiating rigorous tasks for ELLs and SWDs in ELA and 
Mathematics utilizing SDI for differentiation of standard based task. At the classroom level, this includes frequent small 
group instruction, skills intervention using technology, and remediation groupings based on accurate formative 
assessment data. At the school level this includes differentiated professional development and tiered teacher leadership 
to increase staff capacity at meeting these goals.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 5% decrease in level 1s and a 5% increase in proficiency in Math as a result of focusing on 
algebraic expressions as measured by Iready. 

By June 2019, there will be a 5% decrease in level 1s and a 5% increase in proficiency in ELA as a result of establishing a 
system of monitoring independent reading in the classroom as measured by logs and conferencing notes.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element?

Reflection: In the 2017-2018 school year, our attendance rate was 90.97% which was down from 91.2% for the 2016-
2017 schools year. 30.2% of our students has less than 90% attendance. Currently, our attendance rate for 2018-2019 
is 92.9%, showing progress. 

 

Strengths: Our school has a bi-weekly Academic Intervention Team (AIT), weekly School Implementation Team (SIT), and 
a weekly Attendance Team in place that meets to discuss students’ academic, behavioral and emotional needs. We have 
implemented the services of a School Response Team (SRT), and the Astor clinic, which are outside agencies, so that all 
students’ needs are met. Every grade level has a guidance counselor that services not only mandated students, but 
students in crisis.  

 

Needs Improvement: Although these teams are in place, we need to set up systems to ensure that students arrive to 
school and are on time so they may receive instruction for the start of the school day. We have 3 Family Workers, one 
for each grade level, who monitor lateness and make phone calls. We will utilize ATS Reports, ROBO calls and IO

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, we will see a 2% increase in student attendance as a result of weekly attendance meetings, monthly 
celebrations and partnership with ASPIRA, CBO, as evidenced as attendance reports in ATS.

most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Reflection: According to our 2017-18 Principal Performance Observations (PPO), the principal has instituted teacher 
teams across departments and by grades. There is strong reliance on the use of data to drive instruction, and to provide 
targeted intervention. Monday professional development sessions are predominantly delivered by consultants to 
ensure that all staff are familiar with the new curricula in play, and have access to experts in its implementation. The 
school hosted a PLC on Core Ready for its sister middle schools. Also, all teachers have access to IO Education, which 
forms the basis of their collaboration, since they use the data to unpack the success of their lessons and to ascertain 
what standards need to be revisited. In Math, there was strong evidence of the team using planning time to identify 
misconceptions that students would be likely to have or have exhibited in their student work and/or unit assessments. 
The school and teachers use unit and lesson plans across the grades, content areas, and classes that incorporate a 
progression of sequenced and scaffolded skills for all groups of students, including students with disabilities and English 
as New Language Learners.  

Need Improvement: According to our 2017-2018 PPO, the principal must ensure, with her administrative team, that 
teacher practice is aligned with the instructional focus of the school. Across most classrooms, it was evident that data is 
not driving instruction. Seating arrangements, groupings for skills/tiered clusters are not purposeful and low cognitive 
engagement was observed. Professional Development must focus on differentiation and cognitive engagement.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Reflection: According to the 2017-2018 PPO, the principal and assistant principals conducted observations in a timely 
fashion. They have also spent time reviewing their feedback to build coherence and to practice the delivery of more 
specific, actionable next steps for teachers. There are a number of teachers who are being reviewed carefully to 
determine whether or not an extension of probation or a discontinuance is warranted. Again, the principal is on top of 
this work, and has a clear idea of what she wants to build in her teaching staff. Administration will work along with the 
Peer Collaborative Teacher, Model Teacher and grade level leaders to deliver a consistent message to staff so that they 
are not at odds with one another as an administrative team or extended leadership team.  We are reviewing the MOTP 
to inform individualized professional development and support for probationary and tenured teachers.

Reflection: We will utilize a data system IO Education and IO Assessment which includes an online grading system, and a 
student and parent portal allowing for transparency between our teachers, students and parents. We redesigned and 
continuously update our IS131.org website and social media page including calendar of events. We will continue to offer 
parent training on the use of the Pupil Path parent portal and IS131.org website. We offer Curriculum Nights in ELA, 
Math and ENL to inform parents of the Common Core curriculum that is being implemented in the school. We utilize 
Tuesday parent engagement time to contact parents about student progress. We have a brochure for "Super Tuesday" 
which outlines all the parent workshops we offer. We have an active Parent Association that works closely with out 
Parent Coordinator. 

Strengths : According to our 2017-2018 PPO, collaboration between all community stakeholders fosters ongoing 
communication of high expectations and accountability linked to supporting student achievement in understanding and 
meeting those expectations. 

Needs Improvement: We offer many parent workshops and curriculum nights for parents, but our attendance at these 
workshops is minimal. We need to improve on structures to increase our parental involvement in our learning venues.

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.)

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The Albert Einstein Junior High School believes that hiring and developing highly effective teachers is one of the 
cornerstones to producing a highly effective learning environment. In order to ensure that all staffing needs are met, 
teachers first must be deemed highly qualified by the New York State Department of Education. Hiring at I.S. 131 
starts in the spring. The vacancies are posted and resumes are vetted by the Principal and her cabinet via the New 
York City open market system. I.S. 131 then follows through by having candidates go through a rigorous hiring 
protocol. Teachers are invited to interview with the hiring committee, which includes members of the cabinet and 
teachers. Interviewees are asked to bring a portfolio to the interview; the portfolio should include sample student 
work, lesson plans, teacher data tools, observations and other letters of commendation. Teachers deemed well 
qualified by the hiring committee are then asked to do a demonstration lesson at the school. Members of the cabinet 
observe the demonstration lesson and students are asked to rate the teacher. After the demonstration lesson, the 
interviewee participates in a lesson debrief and reflection. Teachers are notified of acceptance by the Principal and 
invited to a new teacher training during the Professional Development days in late August. 

Throughout the school year, probationary and tenured teachers participate in on-going professional development. 
Professional development opportunities include common planning, where teachers work together to develop clear 
and coherent instruction, as well as CCLS aligned tasks and lessons. Teachers meet in Professional Learning Teams 
where they look at student work and data in cross-discipline meetings. There are also Grade Level Meetings where 
teachers discuss current issues, solutions, and strategies to improve the school as well as improving communication 
amongst staff. There is outside professional development for Math teachers through NTN for the development of 
CCLS aligned tasks, professional development for ELA teachers through Lif Life Consultant, and Science through Urban 
Advantage. I.S. 131 also has consultants working with grade teams and APs in ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies as 
well as helping the school create action plans. I.S. 131 also provides all their new teachers with a mentor through the 
city Mentoring program, where new teachers are supported and counseled by a more seasoned teacher.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
The Albert Einstein Intermediate School believes that providing high quality professional development for all staff 
members enables the school to have all students meet the Common Core State Standards. We utilize our Monday 
afternoon Professional Learning time to provide professional development for English teachers through LitLife for 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

implementation of Core Ready, Teacher's College for Lucy Calkins Units of Study in Writing, NTN coaches for 
implementation of KEMS for Math teachers, URBAN ADVANTAGE for Science teachers and Passport Core Curriculum 
for Social Studies teachers. We have coaching days throughout the year from NTN, LitLife, and Urban Advantage for 
curriculum implementation. We have coaching days as well as whole school professional learning by Ramapo for 
Children which focuses on school culture, climate and classroom expectations. All ELA, Math and Tech teachers will 
receive training on the implementation of iReady. The school leaders register teachers and staff based on needs for 
professional learning venues offered through the district and the Bronx Field Office.

2019 school year. This year will be be utilizing IO Education and IO Assessment for the collection of data and District 
Public for the analysis of data. Teachers will have ongoing professional development and coaching for the utilization 
of the program and the analysis of the data for use in their lessons and pedagogical practice. We will use our 
departmental common planning time to create the assessments for use in the implementation of the "Focus Friday". 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal,

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Albert Einstein School, IS 131 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
The Albert Einstein School, IS 131, will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The Albert Einstein School, IS 131, Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the 
needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with 
disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent 
involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation 
through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of 
parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The Community School initiative has integrated academic support. ASPIRA will support The Albert Einstein School by 
providing professional development, classroom management and in class observations to specific teachers through 
our partnership with Ramapo to increase student achievement and proficiency on state exams. ASPIRA will offer 
educational trips and town halls. Additionally, ASPIRA is contracting the Astor Clinic to provide a Licensed Social 
Worker to lead workshops as needed and work with at-risk students and families both in-house and in their off-site 
facilities.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
The Community School goals for the 2018-2019 school year are: 

1.  ASPIRA has provided and will continue to provide an integrated and quality Mental Health subcontractors. 

ASPIRA will continue utilizing Ramapo for teacher training and as coaches to individual teachers. 

2.  ASPIRA will create a Mental Health Plan that earmarks all mental health funding using Astor Clinic. 
3.  ASPIRA will hire a Licensed Clinical Social worker through the Astor Clinic to assist with the identification and 

coordination of students between the SBST team and the school. This individual will serve as an additional 
licensed Social Worker who will lead small group sessions, restorative circles, and one on one sessions based 
on need. (Person to will be hired at the conclusion of November/December) 

4.  ASPIRA will structure family engagement working with the parent coordinator and PTA president that utilizes 

community-based organizations such as ID NYC, ESL programs, Job fairs, and GED programs. ASPIRA is 
working with Astor Clinic to structure family engagement events that focus on mental health, health, and 
nutrition. These initiatives will begin in November 2018 and continue until June 2019. 

5.  ASPIRA will continue to support the schools behavior system by assisting in revamping the PBIS program 
focusing on improving school culture with increased incentives, trips, and activities using the Live School 
program.  

6.  ASPIRA supports the use of Live School for our PBIS program to acknowledge positive student behaviors using 

a points system where points can only be earned and not deducted.  

7.  ASPIRA will continue to support the attendance team by providing Success Mentors (Group leaders, CSD, 

After School Director) to students who fall between chronically absent and severely chronically absent. Also, 
ASPIRA will sit on the attendance meetings and offer training through the Office of Community Schools for 
any staff that wishes to act as a success mentor. ASPIRA hopes it's efforts can help the school increase 
attendance by 2 percent by targeting the chronically absent students. ASPIRA will lead attendance challenges 
and incentives. ASPIRA will start supporting attendance by Mid October. 

8.  Overall, ASPIRA will support the school community and contribute in every possible school function event and 

activity. ASPIRA will also support the school in the day to day school operations such as lunch and hallway 
support as needed.

Part C: Professional Development  
access text and understand difficult content area concepts, and how to use cooperative grouping 
to engage students in accountable talk.  Formal, centrally based professional development is 
attended by our ENL teacher provided by Teacher's College.  Teachers will be receiving training 
in, iReady and LightSail. These professional development venues are at no cost to program.  The 
rational for this ongoing professional development is for teachers to be familiar with the 
curriculum that students are working with during the day and the programs that the students will 
be utilizing in the after school and Saturday program.  All agendas for the professional 
development will be maintained by the Assistant Principal in charge of ENL.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We currently use a variety of assessment systems to monitor our ELL population. As part of the Middle School Quality Initiative 
(MSQI) we administer the Degrees of Reading Power Test (DRPs) which measures each student's ability to read and 
comprehend.  Also all students take an assessment in Reading and Math using iReady,  three times a year (September, January 
and June).  All ENL students are administered an ELL Periodic assessment from School Net in the Fall and the Spring.  This data 
is shared with the ENL teacher, classroom teacher, administrative team, and the curriculum committee.  We administer an 
assessment through LightSail  to determine the Lexile level of each student and an assessment in Sound Reading  Our reading 
data, DRPs, iReady and Light Sail reveal a need for our Spanish speakers to practice fluency and increase sight word 
vocabulary. The data reveals  that our ELL students need to develop the English language starting at the basics.  We have 
incorporated Language Power into our curriculum to address the vocabulary acquisition needs and language progression of all 
ELL students across all content areas. 
      

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have technology, computers and iPads, for the administration of the iReady, LightSail, and Sound Reading.  The students 
are administered the DRPs, or any other periodic assessment with the school community under testing conditions with any 
eligible modifications. ELLs achieving different levels of proficiency based on 2017-2018 NYSESLAT scores will have strategic 
pull out groups during their mandated time. ELL curriculum structures are aligned with CCLS classroom practices and formative 
assessments for all content area teachers. A mandated 15% of professional development for all staff is targeted to our ELL 
population. Returning ELL teacher and ELL administrator received a refresher training on Lightsail in September 2018. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Using many of the data points described above as well as student work, the ENL teacher, Assistant Principal, and Testing 
Coordinator monitor ELL progress and adjust the program to allow at risk students to get more support. The after school 
program is analyzed through a system of short reading and writing passages to determine progress, unit summative 
assessments are collected and analyzed by both the Assistant Principal of the department and ELA grade teams to monitor and 
determine next steps. The students will be administered the ELL Periodic Assessment in the Fall and again in the Spring, the 
DRPs three times throughout the year, math performance task and iReady three times a year in ELA and Math.  We will 
analyze the data to evaluate the success of our program.   
     
The data from the most recent ELL Periodic Assessment (Spring 2017) is as follows, Grade 6, Entering or Emerging students, 0% 
( 0 out of 2) scored between 76-100%, 50% (1 out of 2) scored between 50-74% and 50% (1 out of 2) scored between 25-49%. 
Grade 6 , Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding, 54% (7 out of 13) scored between 50-74%,  38% (5 out of 13) scored 
between a 25-49% and 8% (1 out of 13) scored between a 0-24%.  Grades 7, Entering or Emerging students, 0% ( 0 out of 5) 
scored between 76-100%, 40% (2 out of 5) scored between 50-74%, 40% (2 out of 5) scored between 25-49% and 20% (1 out 
of 5) scored between a 0-24%.  Grade 7 , Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding, 20% (2 out of 10) scored between 75-
100%, 40% (4 out of 10) scored between 50-74%, 30% (3 out of 10) scored between a 25-49% and 10% (1 out of 10) scored 
between a 0-24%. Grade 8 , Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding, 40% (2 out of 5) scored between 50-74%, 40% (2 out 
of 5) scored between 25-49%, and 20% (1 out of 5) scored between 0-24%.    
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

To provide interventions for students, we have an after school and Saturday program geared towards the at risk ELL 
students.  These sessions are taught by a certified ENL teacher.  The ENL After School and Saturday Programs are designed to 
ensure that the English Language Learners develop their language skills in the four modalities, Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing, therefore, they are able to achieve proficiency of more rigorous language demands. As students develop higher levels 
of academic language and learn more content, they need less support to access the curriculum. In these programs teachers 
differentiate content by varying instructional techniques and materials. This includes varying the complexity of assignments, 
asking leveled questions, offering leveled texts and using different resources and materials that cover the same concepts but 
vary in levels of difficulty and abstraction. Students are exposed to language through a variety of activities, such as, reading 
comprehension activities according to their language acquisition, full-color books with photos and illustrations to support 
visual learners, graphic organizers to provide comprehensible input, instructional activities that address multiple learning 
modalities, flexible reading and writing activities through the LightSail Reading Program, I-Ready, NYSESLAT test prep materials 
and the NEWSELA reading comprehension activities according to students' lexile level.  
 
The purpose of these programs is to prepare the ELL's for the English Language Arts (ELA) exam and the New York State English 
as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) respectively. 
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school is a 6-8 middle school.     

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We analyze the data received from NYSELAT There is no distinct patterns or correlation on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT and 
student's grades.  The students that have entered our school and have been administered the NYSITELL were unable to take 
the exam, therefore scoring a 0.  Although students receive ENL services and the majority of instruction is in English, students 
are provided with translated versions of class work, tasks and text books.  Teachers pair up students with bilingual students of 
their native language to assist in translation.  Due to these accommodations, the students tend to score higher grades in their 
subjects than they score on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL levels.    
 
Based on the 2017 NYSESLAT exam as well as new admits in the 2017-18 academic school year; in 6th grade we have 7 
Expanding, 3 Emerging, 4 Transitioning and 2 Entering. In Grade 7 there are 9 Expanding and 7 Transitioning, 2 Emerging and 3 
Entering. In grade 8 there are 10 Expanding, 1 Emerging, 4 Transitioning and 6 Entering. This informs our grouping and push in 
supports, particularly students with different strengths in the 4 processes.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
All our data is collected and entered into a data sheet which is color coded for the levels based on the scale for each 
exam.  This spreadsheet is then analyzed by the ENL teacher, content teachers, data specialist and AP in charge of the ELLs. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Based on CR Part 154, our students in Freestanding ENL program receive standalone ENL or integrated ENL.  We 
utilize the pull-out model for our ELL students who require standalone ENL.  Our entering and emerging ELLs are 
grouped for pull out sessions and meet four times per week for 45 minutes. Our integrated ENL, for all levels or 
language development,  consists of our ENL teacher pushing into our ELA classes 2 to 4 times per week for 45 minutes 
in sixth, seventh and eighth grade depending on required minutes.  Our students are grouped heterogeneously by 
grade level. ELL students receive academic support during Saturday academy in ELA and Math, as well as enrichment 
social and emotional experiences where they practice fluency in a social setting.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   
We do not have this program 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We do not have this program  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our Entering and Emerging students receive standalone ENL four times a week for 45 minutes, for a total of 180 minutes, in a 
push-out model.  The push-in program is integrated ENL with ELA four times a week for 45 minutes, for a total of 180 
minutes.  The Entering and Emerging students receive both the push-out and push-in model ensuring compliance with the 
required 4 units of study.  The push-in program four times a week ensures the mandated minutes of instruction for 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

Transitioning and Expanding students. Our ENL teacher pushes into ELA 2 times a week for our Commanding level students 
who are still entitled for services. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Our Freestanding ENL Program provides instruction in English concentrating on English language acquisition.  We provide 
support in numerous other avenues: bilingual dictionaries are available in the classrooms; and we have acquired translation 
technology that students can utilize in their classrooms.  All the curriculum used in all content areas are aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards and the required Instructional Shifts.  In addition,  ENL strategies and scaffolds are also 
utilized in the major content areas (Science, Social Studies, Math and ELA) in the general education classroom (taught in 
English), in which our ELL population are regularly scheduled. For instance: 
•    Modeling which includes walking students through an interaction during a required task together first, or providing 
students with clear examples of how students from prior years accomplished the task. 
•    Bridging forces connection between new concepts and language and previous knowledge, a necessary component of all 
learning.  It occurs when students are asked to activate their prior knowledge in anticipation of learning new information and 
when personal links are made between the new subject matter and students’ knowledge and experience. 
•    Text re-presentation is the recreation of concepts and language from one genre to another.  In representing information 
from an article in a poster or play, students can access content presented in a more difficult genre as they transform it into an 
easier genre to produce.  Examples of text re-presentation include asking students to transform scientific content into a 
friendly letter to a peer or family member, changing a poem into a narrative or a narrative into a play. 
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We do not currently formally assess our ELLs in their Native Language, except for our baseline exams in all three major content 
areas, Math, Science, and Social Studies. The ENL teacher has students write in their native language and respond to native 
language texts throughout the year to monitor native language skills. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We currently do not have any students that can be considered SIFE, however, if we identify students as such, with a deficit 
in  basic English language skills Just Words will be used in conjunction with direct instruction in phonemes and 
phonemic awareness.   
 
The newcomers (0-3 years) are considered an extremely important part of our school population. The ELL population is diverse 
in many aspects, such as language, culture, levels of English language proficiency, educational background and preparation, 
and grade and age when first enrolled in school.  Many ELLs bring excellent preparation from their home country, while others 
have limited educational experience.  The languages and cultures of all ELLs are respected and valued throughout the 
school.  Their parents are made to feel like important members of the school community. Newcomers are still part of the free 
standing ENL program and the general education classroom (taught in English), the program is differentiated in that these 
students get pull-out services.  Students receive native language support and development during pull-out sessions and English 
language support and development during content classes.  Newcomers are also invited to attend our extended day activities 
with our licensed ENL teacher. 
 
Students who receive service from 4-6 years are also a part of our general education program, they receive pull-out or push-in 
depending on their level and they are also invited to participate in our extended day program with a variety of 
licensed pedagogues for extra support of in-class and homework assignments.  Teachers will work with these students on 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

vocabulary development, writing, and academic language. 
 
I.S. 131 has students who have been in ENL for over six years.  The ENL Department understands that such students 
should receive additional instruction, specifically around the construct and question types they will see on the NYSESLAT 
exam.  Students who have been in ENL for over six years will also be supported during the extended day program, and after 
school and a Saturday venue allowing them extra teacher support and development of at least two times a week in small 
groups.  
       
Former ELLs receive their testing modifications for two years after scoring Commanding on the NYSESLAT.  In addition,  under 
the new guidelines they will receive ENL services (90 minutes per week).  These students are still supported with the 
opportunities for after school and Saturday venues.   
     
Instruction is differentiated for our students using iReady.  iReady is a differentiated web based program which allows for 
individual growth.  We will also be using Imagine Learning to support language acquisition and additional 
intervention supports for our newcomers.  Students are assessed using LightSail,  ELL Periodic Assessment, NYSESLAT, 
NYSITELL and Degrees of Reading Power to determine levels of need for language acquisition.  
 
 
LightSail is an adaptive reading platform available to K-12 schools. LightSail automatically creates personalized libraries for 
each student based on their reading abilities. These libraries adapt as students grow ensuring they are already reading just 
right books. The LightSail library contains more than 6,000 texts written across a wide range of Lexile measures. These texts 
are embedded with assessments and cover a variety of subject matter. Students answer multiple-choice questions, written 
response, and close assessments throughout each text. As student abilities grows, LightSail tracks achievement and updates 
the selection in each reader's library- that way, students are always reading just right texts. Students can track their progress 
against individual reading goals, check their Lexile scores and the number of texts they have completed and show off their 
achievement badges- all via their personal data dashboard. 
 
The data for the students who have been receiving service 4-6 years is examined to determine the greatest need for 
intervention and focused instruction. Depending on the individual situation, Just Words or Imagine Learn may be used to 
deepen the understanding of basic components of the English language. This may assist in a low level reader who struggles 
with decoding.  
 
iReady provides individualized practice based upon their assessment. This material is assigned as an extra support for our long 
term ELLs as well.  For those students who require additional support,  Achieve 3000 and books on tape are incorporated in 
the students learning plan.  Students that are ELLs with 4 to 6 years of service as well as long term ELL's receive push in 
interventions along with additional support through after school programs and Saturday venues.   Our ELLs with identified 
special needs are serviced through a push-in program allowing for individual attention.  Students who are visually impaired are 
provided with large print text as well as content related audio books to support their learning.  
  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We seriously dedicate ourselves to serve special education students with the same type of material, resources and quality of 
instruction as any other student.  SWDs follow a similar block program in which Special Education content experts 
deliver instruction and facilitate learning based on the students individual education plan and level of language 
proficiency.   ELLs who are served by their IEP follow subject specific units of study, differentiated based on ability.  In class 
supports in Special Education classrooms include Scantron Performance Series instruction (online testing and differentiation 
material).  Teachers also provide students with leveled text (American Reading Company - 100 Book Challenge, LightSail) and 
support questions to increase English Language comprehension and fluency. 
 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

Teachers of  ELL-SWD students use the research based common core aligned city approved curriculum in all content areas. If 
the IEP mandates ELL services, the child receives ELL services with our ENL teacher according to their level and required 
minutes in a pull-out or push-in model. 
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 We use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least restrictive 
environment by programming our ELL-SWDs alongside our general education students.  The students are programmed based 
on level not by "category".  Materials used are based on students current level based on data and assessed throughout the 
course of the school year to determine when students are ready to "graduate" to the next level.  All ELLs are leveled by 
Entering, Emerging,Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding.   The students are placed in the special education setting as 
described in their IEP, whether it is ICT, self-contained or SETSS. 
   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs are similar to those in the General Education program.  Intervention is targeted and 
specific.  An ELL student who is recommended, by their classroom teacher, to the academic intervention team (comprised of 
the guidance counselor, assistant principal, IEP team, attendance teacher and invited teacher guests) are prescribed a variety 
of intervention services based on need.  Student intervention services include, small group instruction that mimics the day 
instruction (extended day program, all four subjects), guided reading support (ELA and SS), and push-in services by licensed 
teachers.  Intervention and service support correspond to each ELLs' age and grade level. We also offer an after school and 
Saturday intervention program (ELA and Math) designed specifically for the ELL students. These targeted intervention services 
are for all four content areas, ELA, Math, Science and Social Studies. 
   
 We offer an after school program for ELL students on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 to 4:45 in our school. The ENL and 
the ELA teachers work collaboratively and are in charge of running this intervention program.  Throughout this program ELLs 
are grouped according to their language progression. The Entering level students are grouped homogeneously. There are 
eleven ELLs working as the Entering group. These students share similar needs, strengths and weaknesses.  This group is 
instructed with the Language Power Program. This program is designed to help newcomers learn how to listen, speak, read, 
and write in English. The program teaches new words and expressions that they can use in everyday conversations. Each 
chapter has a story about a group of teenagers and the things that happen to them at home, at school, and around town. 
Before each chapter, students look at the pictures to help them understand what they are reading. 
  
On the other hand, the Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding leveled students work together in a group of twelve.  The 
instruction for this group of students is with Focused Reading Intervention. We understand that an effective intervention 
program can make the difference between struggle and success for students. The Focused Reading Intervention program 
includes explicit instruction, guided lessons, engaging reading passages, educational games, and multiple opportunities to 
practice. Learning to read is a complex process. Most children learn to read and continue to grow in their mastery of this 
process. However, there continues to be a group of children for whom learning to read is a struggle.  
  
   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are utilizing Language Power Program this school year for intervention for our Entering and Emerging students.  Language 
Power is a Research-based Program that supports English language development as it provides an enjoyable, content-rich 
vehicle for learning English. Since research has repeatedly shown that the most effective ways of developing students' second 
language and literacy skills are by building upon the first language, explicitly demonstrating how the English language works, 
this program facilitates learning a language through rich content, and providing varied and frequent opportunities for students 
to use academic English. Language Power materials are carefully selected to provide students with a variety of ways to 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

encourage the development of  their English Language acquisition with a great deal of exposure to the target language. It helps 
students by practicing effectively for Language Development in the four language domains (Listening, Speaking, Reading, and 
Writing), building background knowledge and vocabulary, giving students opportunities to use language through the use of 
graphic organizers in Student Guided Practice Book, Scaffolding Literacy, Differentiating instruction, using assessment 
options and  by empowering families to support their child's language development through Family Literacy Activities for each 
lesson. 
  
We have purchased iReady, Achieve 3000, LightSail and Imagine Learn for use by the ELL students and for the upcoming school 
year we have purchased Sound Reading. 
These are among the improvements that will be considered for the upcoming school year : 
•     The use of more graphic organizers: Graphic organizers will provide students with more concrete ways to visualize 
information found in a text. Since English language learners rely to a great extent on graphics, charts and other visual aids, I 
will supply a variety of organizers to help students capture the sequence of events, compare and contrast, summarize, make 
connections, and identify areas of confusion. 
•     More text features such as titles, chapter titles, bold words, captions and diagrams to assist students in identifying main 
ideas and key details of a text. 
•     Encourage students to ask questions throughout the reading process, so they can be engaged and actively read. Allowing 
students to form their own questions provides an authentic purpose for reading.  Motivate them to practice forming their own 
who, what, when, where, and why questions.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We did not have a bilingual program.  We are not planning on discontinuing any programs or services for ELLs.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
IS 131 has an after school venue provided by ASPIRA NY and 21st Century.  All students are invited to attend. The program's 
staff goes to each classroom to discuss the program and invite the students to apply to the program. We use School Messenger 
to inform parents of the program. In addition, we offer an after school venue on Wednesdays and Thursdays, for ELA and 
Math, to ensure success on the CC State Exams and the NYSESLAT exams. Any program offered at the school is offered to the 
ELL students.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We will utilize New York ELLS, Language Power Program, CoreReady, Teacher's College Units of Study in Writing, Key to 
Mathematical Success (KEMS) with Engage NY,  Passport in Social Studies.    All ELL students are using Achieve 3000, an online 
reading program that is offered in the native language, if needed, to help increase vocabulary development and reading 
comprehension. Our Entering students also utilize LightSail  and Language Power which provides strategic first-language 
support in 15 languages to facilitate and enhance learning. We have laptops and IPads in the classrooms for the students to 
access the online programs. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Our ENL program is taught primarily in English with 25% being taught in native language of Spanish.  We have native language 
dictionaries and have acquired translation devices for our predominately native language speakers.      
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The curriculum used in the content areas for our ELL population are all on grade level and aligned to the CCLS. The curriculum 
used in the ENL program align to grade level, and language level.           
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
As previously mentioned we ensure that all of the ELLs' needs are met.  We are a co-located building but we do not rely or 
share any resources to ensure our student's needs are met. 
 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We are a zoned school that accepts students from our feeder schools as well as a Middle School of Choice and the incoming 
6th grade students are invited to attend an orientation along with their parents.  In November,  we have an open house for all 
interested incoming students for the next school year.  Students that enroll throughout the year are placed in a classroom with 
other students from similar backgrounds and/or language as well as given a tour of the building (both student and 
parent).  During the interview stage for new admits, both the parent and student meet with the ENL teacher (L. Altidor) and 
the Grade Guidance Counselor to help complete the application process and describe the program we have at I.S. 131.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At this time I.S. 131 does not provide any language electives to any sixth, seventh or eight grade student. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

At the present time we do not have a dual language program.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In order to support professional development, teachers meet in teams, during departmental common planning periods, to 
discuss best practices, create and analyze common assessments, and look at student work.  With the support of our Borough 
Field Office, teachers participate in workshops and other professional development opportunities to strengthen their 
understanding of the ELL and share teaching strategies.  Teachers of ENL and of content areas attended professional learning 
venues on Election day.  We also sent out teachers to professional development series pertaining to teaching the ELL students. 
Our content teachers and administrators  have participated in PD focusing on scaffolds to utilize when teaching ELL students. 
 
In turn, the ENL teacher shares the strategies with the general education teachers during common planning periods.  We have 
sent teachers to Core Ready, Teacher's College, and NTN, training to learn the common core aligned curriculum and how to 
deliver instruction. We have consultants for ELA and Math to support our teachers and our ENL teacher is a member of the 
District ENL Professional Learning Community. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  
Most professional development opportunities are done "in-house" during professional learning team meetings.  Teacher plan 
together and discuss teaching strategies to assist English Language Learners, students with disabilities and students in the 
bottom third.  The ENL teacher joins the subject area common planning meetings periodically throughout the year in order to 
share insights about the students, as well as best practices with the general education teachers.  I.S. 131 will dedicate a 
minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers, to language acquisition including a focus on 
best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. For our ENL teacher 50% of 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 

the required professional development hours will be dedicated to the above.  Agendas and sign-in sheets are maintained for all 
professional development to keep a record of hours which are kept in the main office as well as by the assistant principal in 
charge of the ENL department.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
To support students who are transitioning from elementary schools to middle school, we have town hall meetings to discuss 
goals and our school's vision.  We also meet to help acclimate the students to our school environment.  In early September we 
have an orientation for families and their children to meet the teachers, learn about our programs and school.  We have 
support staff available, guidance, and social workers, to offer additional support if needed regarding issues or concerns that 
may arise as a result of transitioning into the middle school as well as offer translation support.  Orientation sessions and other 
programs and workshops are provided to parents where they can actively and effectively engage in extended discussions 
about most student social and academic situations.  Parents are also provided with support materials and resources to ensure 
student success.   
 
Opportunities are made available to parents to participate with school governance decisions [Parent Association and School 
Leadership Team].  We hold a monthly "Breakfast with the Principal and Parent Coordinator" where parents have an open 
forum to discuss concerns and learn about the happenings at IS 131.  Throughout the year workshops will be provided to give 
the parents some base knowledge on the curriculum that is being presented to their children.  These workshops are run by 
highly qualified staff members who will present ELA and Math instruction to the parents who attend.   We have provided a 
parent lounge right next to the main office so that parents can log onto one of the computers there and check Pupil Path for 
their child's grades and NYC School Access for their child’s progress, attendance, etc.  We also have a Parent Association room 
and a Parent Coordinator office. Whenever there is a workshop or meeting, a sign-in sheet is provided in order to keep 
attendance.  Copies are held by both the Parent Coordinator and Principal's Secretary. In addition to ENL curriculum night the 
ENL teacher, Ms. Altidor, sets up individual meetings during the Tuesday parental engagement time to discuss program and 
progress pertaining to their child. Our ENL teacher translates in Spanish and French.  If there is a need for a different language 
we utilize the translation services provided by the city of New York. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents of our ELLs are invited to all activities we host at I.S. 131.  Our parent coordinator posts the "Monthly Madness" which 
is a list of all workshops and events occurring in IS 131 each month.  In addition the flyer for those programs are back packed 
with each student.  Our parent coordinator also has "Super Tuesday" events which are in coordination with the parental 
engagement on Tuesday afternoons.  In addition to those workshops/meetings, we hosted two workshops specifically for our 
ELL parents.  These workshops included discussions on our ENL program, curriculum, and assessments students will take 
throughout the school year. All of the meetings that are held are sent out through School Messenger to the parents.  All 
correspondence to parents are offered in the parent's preferred language.  We monitor attendance by having sign-in sheets, 
which are are held by the Parent Coordinator as well as the Principal's secretary.  If any parent is in need of translation services 
that we can not provide in-house we utilize the translation services provided by the city of New York.  
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Monique Mason, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At IS 131 we distribute the Preferred Language Form to our students to bring home and have filled out by their 
parents. With the support of school personnel, we contact parents that have not returned the form. We then 
attach an additional copy to the report cards of the students who failed to return the document and have the 
parents fill it out during parent teacher conference. This ensures that we are apprised of the current language 
preference of our parents. At the beginning of the school year, we run the Adult Preferred Language Report 
(RAPL) and the Adult Information report (RADL) from ATS. We gather data from school emergency cards and as 
students enter the school for the first time we administer the Home Language Identification Survey(HLIS). 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

How do you plan to translate? Include 
procedures to ensure timely provision 
of translated documents to parents.  

All correspondence that is 
disseminated to parents are translated 
to Spanish. All our School Messenger 
phone blasts are in English and 
Spanish. If a parent requests any 
information in their home language, 
other than English or Spanish, then we 
will utilize the translation department 
and provide them with a translated 
version in their home language. We 
will utilize the SMS messaging service 
from IO Education where all messages 
and correspondences to and from 
parents will be translated to their 
native language. Parents may respond 
back and the service will translate back 
to English.  

Posted on the school website and

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

All our correspondence via our school messenger are translated into Spanish since that is our largest non English 
speaking population. We will utilize the interpretation services provided by the DOE to reach parents of students who 
speak a language other than English or Spanish. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We hold our staff meeting on the first day of the school year. This is the time we disseminate all the pertinent 
information to the staff. They are given the Community Handbook with all highlighted Chancellor's Regulations, 
including A-663. The assistant principal explains all highlighted regulations with the staff and explains all available 
resources. During a Monday afternoon professional development venue we will hold a professional development 
session exclusively on translations and interpretation services. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

IS 131 fulfills Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification for translation services in a 
variety of ways. Upon entering the building the parents will see the sign "Welcome Parents" in 9 languages along with 
the sign informing parents of the availability of an interpreter and translation services. Behind the safety officers desk 
is also a sign giving the phone number for the interpreter services to assist a parent. Upon registration parents are 
given the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities and the Parent's Guide to Language Access in English or one of the 
nine offered languages. If a parent requests a plan or any other information in their home language, we will utilize the 
translation department and provide them with a translated version in their home language.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?

We will gather data in reference to quality and availability of service from the parent survey. We will recruit parents 
inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to be a focus group to gather feedback and best 
practices on use of the available services.
