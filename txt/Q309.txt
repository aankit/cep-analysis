Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

The mission of the Academy of Medical Technology is to provide students with a rigorous course of study focused on 
a future in health care professions. Students are supported by a highly qualified staff, keenly focused on success. We 
seek to educate the whole student by supporting both academic as well as socio-emotional needs. We stress college 
and career readiness from grades 6-12. All students at AMT know that college and a quality career are the final goals. 
Our students come from some of the most diverse areas in New York City and we celebrate as a community of 
learners. Our school offers students a dynamic learning environment that caters to diverse needs. At the Academy of 
Medical Technology, all students learn. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Academy of Medical Technology (AMT) serves grades 6 to 12 in Community School District 27 (CSD 27) in Far 
Rockaway, Queens. CSD 27 is the largest geographical district in New York City. AMT is a Title 1 school. The school 
population is comprised of 44% Black, 42% Hispanic, 4% White, and 6% Asian students. The student body includes 
18% English Language learners and 15% students with disabilities. 

 

Student voice is heard through our nationally recognized chapter of HOSA (Health Occupations Students of America). 
Through HOSA student leaders are developed and supported. Our best and brightest compete in state and national 
competitions based around health care professions. Our students have won several state medals often ranking 1st in 
the state. We challenge our students to succeed not only academically but also as future members of the health care 
community. We have expanded the HOSA membership to include our middle school students as Jr. HOSA candidates. 
At AMT we feel it is never too early to get involved. 

 

To support the career goals of our student body we partner with St. John's Episcopal to provide students with 
internship opportunities throughout the hospital. Through this program students serve in several capacities 
throughout the hospital. Students learn true practical skills directly from health care clinicians. Students leave us with 
a true feeling for what it means to be gainfully employed. We strive to give students the broadest cross-section 
experiences that health care professionals can impart. 

 

Our "Medical Scholars Program" is a partnership with Plaza College that gives our students the opportunity to attend 
Plaza College as full college students, while obtaining free college credits. Our joint articulation program allows 
students to continue at Plaza beyond graduation to receive an Associates degree within one year (five year associated 
degree path). Students who enter this program finish with their associates degree and a "Medical Assisting" license 
through the New York State Office of Professions. 

 

To further our students on the path to college and career readiness we also partner with Mercy College in offering an 
additional 24 credits of college level study. Students have an opportunity to earn college credit from sophomore 
through senior year and beyond. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           11 

 

 

To support the social needs of our students and families AMT has partnered with several community organizations to 
expand learning opportunities beyond our classrooms. We work very closely with our on-campus health center 
funded through Northwell Health in providing our students and families with a wide variety of health care solutions. 
Our campus is also a member of the Community Learning Schools initiative (CLS) to further support our students and 
families in meeting their health, educational and wellness needs. Some of our popular adult programs include IC3 
computer training, weekly Zumba classes as well as a variety of seminars on important topics like financial literacy. 

 

The AMT community continually works to recruit and bring in families as part of the educational vision for our school. 
As part of the endeavor we have added special Saturday programming for families, special presentations from a 
variety of interest groups and seminars to help our parents and families grow. 

 

Our other community partners include; 

STARTRAK: Queens District Attorney early intervention program 

  Community Meditations Services (CMS): Middle School after school program 
 
  New York Blood Center 
  New York Partnership for Parks 
  New York City Public Library 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

As a community where at least 70% of families receive free lunch and one still dealing with the impact of "Super 
Storm Sandy" our students and families often need support and guidance in meeting basic needs. AMT partners with 
numerous local agencies and political offices to support our students and families. As a schools in Far Rockaway New 
York we serve a broad and diverse student population including those with disabilities as well as language acquisition 
needs. Our students range from those whose families have lived in the community for generations, to those who have 
only come to the United States recently. All are welcome at AMT. We support diverse learners in language acquisition 
as well as development of literacy skills. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year we have made great strides in strengthening "Rigorous Instruction". With the support of the our 
ENL teachers students showed success in moving at least one proficiency level rating on a least one fo the two 
sections of the NYSESLAT. This success prompted a change of our "Rigorous Instruction" goal to focus on challenging 
students to deepen and extend their writing skills across all content areas.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows:

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Academy of Medical Technology , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Elementary Secondary School Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Academy of Medical Technology will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

Providing parents and families multiple communication access points in order to facilitate a better partnership. Some 
examples of programs we offer include: 

  Access to Pupil Path, an online system that allows parents/guardians and students to view student grades, 

transcripts, teachers, attendance and school level anecdotals for each student. This online program also 
allows parents/guardians to email any staff member at any time to clarify any questions or concerns. 

  We will host Super Saturday programs multiple times throughout the year to involve and engage parents in 
informational sessions to support student academic success. Some examples of the Super Saturday parent 
workshops include:

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator who will have an open door policy to allow any parent/guardian to come into the 
school to talk about questions or concerns about their child. The parent coordinator will also serve as a liaison and 
advocate for the families. 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           47 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
  This year we will be addressing the needs of our growing middle school population by 
implementing an after school film program.  We will use age appropriate, content related films to 
build up students' background knowledge in ELA, as well as to increase students' overall 
understanding of American Culture and history.  Students will participate in a variety of class 
discussions and activities surrounding selected films. This program will focus 
on acquainting students with both basic vocabulary and phrases (for newcomers) as well 
as ELA related vocabulary and concepts for students taking the State ELA exam in the 
spring.  For example, students will learn about the concept of a plot diagram and literary 
elements such as setting, characterization, tone and theme.  In addition students will gain 
knowledge of the English language in preparation for the NYSESLAT.  For example, students 
will have practice listening to extended passages and movie clips in English and responding to 
these clips in English.  Students will also receive practice responding to visuals in writing.   
 
The grade levels served in this program will be 6th, 7th, and 8th.  There will be two subgroups; 
entering and emerging and ELL's taking the middle school State ELA test.  
 
 
This program will meet twice a month after school from 2pm till 4pm.  There will be a total of 
10 sessions.   
 
The language of instruction will be English with Spanish and Arabic supports as necessary.   
 
This program will require one certified ESL teacher 
 
Materials will include use of a working Smartboard, copies of selected films, ESL dictionaries, 
and general classroom materials.   
 
There will be approximately 30 students invited to this program.   
 
Additionally, we have identified the need to support our High School population in passing their 
required Regents Exams.  According to the data, our students have the most trouble passing the 
Global Studies and U.S. History Regents'.  Therefore, we will be implementing an after 
school program at the High School level which will target ESL students struggling in Global 
Studies, U.S. History and Living Environment.  As ESL teachers we can attest to the fact that 
this population often lacks relevant background knowledge in regard to both Global and 
American history.  Therefore, this program's goal is to help build students' background

knowledge in these two subjects, and in so doing, give them the tools necessary to succeed in the 
classroom and on their required Regents' exams.   
In addition, we will be targeting the Living Environment Regents, as all high school students 
must pass at least one Science Regents to graduate. 
Additionally, One ESL teacher will lead a NYSESLAT review to prepare students for this exam 
in the spring. Students will have practice responding to listening passages, answering oral 
questions, answering multiple choice questions, and analyzing photos and charts in writing.   
 
Grade levels to be served with this program will be 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th graders taking either 
Global Studies or U.S. History, Living Environment and/or Earth Science.  There will be 
approximately 45 students invited to this program; 18 students for Global Studies, 13 students 
for U.S. History, 15 students for Earth Science, and 15 students for Living Environment.  
The Social Studies program will meet one time per week for one hour with a total of 25 
sessions.   
The Science program will meet one time per week for one hour with a total of 25 sessions. 
The NYSESLAT program will meet one time per week for one hour with a total of 25 session 
The primary language of instruction will be English with supports in Spanish, French Creole, and 
Arabic as needed.   
This program will include two certified ESL teachers as well as one Certified Global Studies 
teacher, one Certified U.S. History teacher, and one certified Living Environment teacher.   
 
Materials:  Working Smartboards, Global Studies, and U.S. History primary source documents in 
English as well as Students' native language for support.  Living Environment materials 
including modified Living Environment readers and glossaries in students' native language.

 Professional development will be provided to assist content teachers in creating scaffolded but 
meaningful academic support lessons.  ESL strategies will be introduced to content teachers 
and ESL teachers will work with content teachers to design Content Based ESL lessons for use 
in the afterschool program.  Lessons will include multiple entry points for diverse learners so that 
lessons are accessible to all students.   
 
One Global Studies teacher, one U.S. History teacher, and one Living Environment teacher will 
receive professional development from one ESL teacher.  These teachers will receive 2 hours of 
training prior to the start of the program.   
 
Professional Development will include lesson planning with modifications for ELLs, formal and 
informal assessments of student progress, as well as introduction of writing and reading activities 
to expedite comprehension for language learners.

Parental engagement is an integral piece of the educational process.  Parents of ESL students will 
be invited to attend our Parental Engagement program.  During this time parents will 
be acquainted with the school calendar and will have the opportunity to create their own school 
calendars for use in their homes.  In addition, parents will receive valuable information regarding 
the Common Core Standards and requirements for graduation, so that they may support their 
children in succeeding in their academics and moving towards graduation. 
This program will include 3 ESL teachers (one of which is bilingual in Spanish and English) 
There will be a total of 5 one hour sessions 
 
The ESL Coordinator will collaborate with the Guidance Counselors to notify families about the 
program in their home language through written letters/ flyers.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessments tools utilized by the school include the NYSITELL, SPANISH LAB, NYSESLAT, and Fountas and Pinell Running 
Records.  In addition, the DRP is administered at the middle school level as prescribed by the Middle School Quality Initiative 
(MSQI).  Finally, Achieve 3000 is utilized to assess the lexile levels of all ELLs.  The Data reveals that the vast majority of 
students begin their academic careers at the "entering" level. Data also shows that the majority of our students read & write 
at relativley basic levels in their first language and/or come in with a lack of the academic exposure necessary to perform at 
grade level. Consequently, they have a limited amount of academic skills to transfer from their L1.  Therefore, when preparing 
lesson plans and units of study we focus on developing students' foundational literacy skills as well as increasing academic

vocabulary .  Additionally,  these assessments assist with the programming process so that ENL teachers can be programmed 
strategically to the classrooms with the highest need of support.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Data based on Periodic Assessments, State Assessments, and overall yearly student performance is used to evaluate our 
programs for ELLs. We also assess our performance through data derived from surveys completed by parents and students. 
Additionally, the ESL department creates attainable goals for the heterogenous groups of ELLs; which are then visited and 
evaluated in department meetings. We monitor these goals through instructional outcomes, and summative and formative 
assessments throughout the school year. This program evaluation also considers the quantity of studens achieving proficiency 
level in the NYSESLAT exam. For students with IEPs, open communication is maintaied at all times with the Special Education 
team in our school in order to work cohesively toward reaching the child's educational & language development goals.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not Applicable  We do not utilize a Response to Intervention framework as we are a 6-12 school.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data patterns on the NYSITEL reveal that the majority of ELLs enter the United States with extremely minimal amount of 
English proficiency and therefore require intensive English language instruction upon entering the NYC public school system. 
Students who have been exposed to some English language instruction in ther country of origin may score higher on the 
reading and writing sections of the NYSITEL & NYSESLAT, while others with the opposite experience will score and longer 
remain as beginners across all modalities. To this end,  the ESL team uses the NYSESLAT results/data to plan intensive 
sheltered instruction with native language support. Consequently, the same data is used to obtain resources that can assist 
and support students in the classrooms. As important, after school programs are also considered and planned using the same 
data.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           59 

 

 

The organizational models we utilize are push-in and Freestanding classes.  All entering and emerging level students 
receive freestanding ESL classes provided by a certified ESL teacher.  In addition, certified ESL teachers are 
strategically placed in all integrated  ELA/ENL  classes.  ENL teachers co-teach with the general education teacher to 
scaffold, differentiate and deliver instruction through a collaborative push-in model.   In addition, Regents level social 
studies classes also receive ENL support through a push-in coteaching model.  Grouping for Push-Ins is always 
heterogenous and is consistent across all grade levels.

Paste response to questions here:    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              All ELL students are being served the appropriate amount of ESL minutes according to CR Part 154.  Entering 
and emerging students at the middle school level are receiving 360 minutes per week, and 540 minutes a week at the high 
school level.  At the transitional and expanding level students recieve 180 minutes a week.  Students at the Commanding level 
receive 90 minutes a week.  For entering and emerging students the minutes are filled through a mix of freestanding ENL 
classes and ELA push ins.  For the transitioning, expanind, and commanding students minutes are filled through integrated ELA 
and Social Studies push-ins.      
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Due to the nature of the instructional mandates of an ESL program, which is 100% English instruction, all content area 
materials  and instruction are presented in English, however, students are provided with native language support through the 
use of bilingual dictionaries and glosseries.  In addition, delivery of instruction is modified to suit the needs of ELLs at the time 
that lesson/unit planning takes place. For example, graphic organizers are created, extensive visual aides are included and 
vocabulary is pre-taught to accommodate Language Learners. Through SMARTboards, teachers include various forms of 
media, audio, and realia to help enrich and develop the language acquisition process. In math and science for example, 
students are provided with a range of manipulatives which trigger tactile learning and make instruction more meaningful. In 
addition, ELLs are granted additional time to complete classroom work such as do nows, quizzes, exams, assessments, 
projects, etc. ELLs identified as students with disabilities receive ESL support through the team teaching model as well as 
through pull-outs when necessary. To this end, content area teachers receive professional development in ESL methodologies 
and techniques to aide in scaffolding overall instruction for ELLs.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                The ESL coordinator and ESL teachers work very closely with the testing coordinator and faculty in our middle and 
high school to ensure that ELLs receive the mandated and appropriate accommodations. In fact, they receive updated lists of 
our population of ELLs, which includes information about their native language. This not only assists with the ordering of the 
various assesments in the students' native language, but also ensures that test modifications and testing accommodations take 
place. In addition, due to the large Spanish speaking population of ELLs, we use the Spanish Lab-R as a predictor of the possible 
transfer of language skills our students may achieve. To this end, we have implementated  a Native Language Arts course in 
Spanish for entering and emerging students at the middle school level.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The needs of our entire population of ELLs (including SIFE students) are met through our individualized prescription program. 
Students are provided a "prescription" from their subject class teacher, which are then "filled" at our pharmacy during AIS on 
Mondays and Tuesdays for an extra period. "Prescriptions" identify the specific skills and language needs of each student. 
Students who are newcomers are placed into a beginner ESL program. These classes dedicate a large focus on gaining 
vocabulary through role play and many visuals; therefore targeting speaking skills. The focal point of instruction for ELLs 
receiving services for 4-6 years is building reading stamina and comprehension and developing native-like overall 
communication skills. Hence, instruction is also focused on writing techniques and one of our goals is to go from Learning to 
Read to Reading to Learn. Strategies include poject-based learning, and collaborative team-teaching to scaffold instruction. 
Our plan for our long-term ELLs is to work collaboratively with the Special Education department to implement the ELAND 
process due to the fact that the majority of our long term ELLs are SWDs. Furthermore, we offer an after-school/Saturday 
program which complements the learning process with field trips to reinforce and further facilitate the language acquisition 
and the sociocultural assimilation of all our ELLs in middle and high school. This program includes tutoring opportunities and 
access to laptops with internet access. This program is made possible through Title III funds. Continuing transitional support is 
provided for former ELLs who have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT for up to two years after reaching proficiency. 
Support is provided through appropriate testing modifications and accommodations, extended time on projects, access to our 
ESL library and resources as well as placement in the subject specific/ESL team teaching model. In fact, our testing 
coordinators and faculty members are aware of this group of students and are therefore sensitive to their academic needs; 
even when the team-teaching/push-in model is not available during a specific period. To this end, we will achieve overall 
success by working collaboratively across with our entire staff, the content area teachers, and our administration.       
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The Academy of Medical technology enables diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain Engish proficiency in the 
least restrictive environnment through the Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) and Special Education Support Services (SETSS) models 
in grades 6 through 12. Currently, we have 6 certified special education teachers to service, monitor and maintain compliance 
for both, our middle and high school ELL-SWDs. As importantly, the same staff ensures that these students' IEPs remain 
current and parent conferences take place to perform an annual review.  An ENL teacher is present at all IEP meetings for 
ELLs.  During this time, student goals and services are reviewed and updated as needed. Furthermore, Special Ed, General Ed 
and ESL teachers strategically plan units of lessons collaboratively to scaffold and differentiate instruction aligned to their IEP 
mandates and ESL/language proficiency needs.  In terms of materials, ENL teachers use graphic novels to accelate language 
development in ENL and ELA classes.  All teachers are also provided with a range of content related graphic organizers to 
assists ELL-SWDs within throughout the subjects.  In addition, our ENL lab has been supplied with an updated SMART Board as 
well as a class set of IPads for instuctional use.  All teacher materials are aligned to the DOE's Common Core Standards.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We offer academic support via tutoring twice a week after school (AIS). We also have a SocioCultural Saturday Academy on 
weekends which exposes students to the American culture, history, and environment through both, instruction aligned to the 
various subjects and educational field trips to museums, parks, and theatres, etc. Students are exposed to social interaction 
and English language in various forms - written & oral. Both programs are available in English for our entire population of ELLs, 
regardless of proficiency level. In addition, we offer APEX for our high school students. APEX offers online courses including 
core curriculum, electives and world language courses, Advanced Placement (AP), and credict recovery courses as well. APEX 
mentors know the students individually and help them stay on track and provide exam proctoring. As important, mentors 
serve as liaisons between online learning and the school community to help students succee in an online learning 
environment. In addition, Spanish speaking ELLs enrolled in Spanish 2 & 3 have the opportunity to read novels in their native 
language. To this end, instruction is also aligned with the CCSS for English in order to support the core subject and use it as a

springboard to transfer the same literacy skills and knowledge into other subjects.This school year we have had a vast growth 
in newcomers at our school. Therefore we feel the need to create a newcomers after school program to help accommodate 
these students and reinforce the basic skills that they need in order to succeed at the Academy of Medical Technology. 
This English as a Second Language (ESL) Newcomer Program is designed to provide learning opportunities in the English 
language and the American culture for students in grades 6 through 12 who are identified as Newcomer English Language 
Learners. It is created to meet the needs of such students. Learning to speak, read and comprehend spoken and written 
English is crucial for newcomers to the American education experience.  
The program will focus on the most basic of language skills, such as:  
•               Phonics/ Decoding 
•               Basic Vocabulary- such as family members, weather, numbers, etc. 
•               Speaking skills- How to introduce themselves, asking for directions, etc. 
•               NYSESLAT Test Prep 
•               Sociocultural & linguistic interaction through hands-on explorations  
Students come to classrooms with different interests and varying intelligences and learning styles. Instructional activities and 
assessments should reflect these needs. Basing instruction on meaningful communicative tasks motivates students to learn a 
second language. The teacher’s role is to facilitate genuine interaction among students through classroom activities that are 
embedded in authentic real-life contexts.  
For direct instruction, our expenditure is 1 teacher x 3 hours x 15 sessions x $41.98 = $1,892.10. To this end, AMT is proposing 
to use Title III allocations to fund a Newcomers Program. It will commence on February 6, 2014 until May 29, 2014 
•               Approximately 20 students who have been identified as beginner ELL’s in both Middle and High School, have been 
selected to participate in this program. 
•               Sessions will meet every Thursday for direct classroom instruction from 2pm until 4pm. 
•               One additional hour will be allocated for the teacher to prepare lesson. 
•               Hands-on explorations will be scheduled to complement the classroom lessons, as well as, reinforce and facilitate 
genuine social and linguistic interaction.  
•               Materials: General classroom supplies, NYSESLAT Test Prep Books, board games such as Scrabble to reinforce 
vocabulary and spelling skills, technology (such as iPads, and Smartboard), internet access, admission and transportation fees. 
•               One certified ESL teacher   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The effectivness of our programs is noted through the overall progress and performance of our ELL students across the grades 
and subjects. Their grades and evident language development (oral, written) are a reflection of this. The exposure of the 
English language in its various forms (written and oral) delivered in a non-restrictive environment helps students feel confident 
to practice their language abilities. In fact, being among their peers in the same or similar linguistic circumstances, provides 
them with a sense of comfort and hope. Working collaborativerly with ungraded ELLs in a heterogenous group accelerates 
their language development as well. Through the credit recovery program (APEX), students work at their own pace using 
technology; therefore it provides a less restrictive environment while conducive to learning. APEX incorporates assessments 
throughout its lessons and expedites immediate results to the collaborating content area teacher. Communication with the 
student is maintained throughout the APEX sessions and the collaborating teacher is available to meet with the student during 
the school day. Consequently, ESL teachers frequently conduct one on one conferencing with teachers of other subject areas 
to maintain a collaborative learning environment across the subjects, and as importantly, to ensure the effectivness of our 
current programs. As importantly, collaborating APEX teachers report student data to our administration for their review and 
student credit consideration.  In addition, we provide additional content support through our Title III, Regents preparation 
program where we target specific Regents classes that students need to graduate.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

This year we're planning on working with SEA Theatre Company in the implementation of a residency program. The objective is 
for our ELLs to strategically continue to develop their overall English language skills and fluency as they read and speak; as well 
as build academic vocabulary. Simultanously, expose them to classic literature through art as the program will conclude with a 
student performance of "Don Quijote" or "West Side Story".  Parents, faculty, and peers will be invited to the final 
performance, to take place on our premises, toward the end of the school year      
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Currently, there aren't any plans to discontinue any programs for ELLs.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We are an active chapter of the Health Occupations Students of America or HOSA. A student-led national organization with a 
program of work designed to provide developmental opportunities which will develop future leaders of the health care 
community. Our students, ELLs included, have the opportunity to attend and participate in the New York Leadership 
Conferences and competitive events which are supported by the New York State Department of Education. In fact, last year's 
high school valedictorian, Kevin Merizalde (a former ELL), was an asset as an active member of our HOSA chapter. In addition, 
Steven Escobar (a former ELL) received a scholarship, upon graduating from high school, to assist with college expenses. All ELL 
students receive information and invitations - either in the form of letters or flyers - to participate in a given program/club. For 
example, they are encouraged to participate in peer tutoring opportunities. In this program, high school students offer one-on-
one tutoring to middle school students in core subject areas twice a week after school. Overall, ELLs are invited to join our 
Saturday Academy, as well as, AIS after school and our new theatre workshop program; to mention a few.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our classrooms are all equiped with SMARTboards and every teacher is provided with a laptop, readily with software and 
internet accessablity. In addition, every department has access to laptop carts with internet, and projectors. Every classroom is 
also equiped with a white board, library, dictionaries, and general art materials. Teachers use network applications and the 
internet such as Netflix, BrainPop, Flocabulary, Study Island, google translate, wordreference, etc. to complement instruction. 
Novels are also available in the predominant language of the majority of newcomer ELLs. For example, a leveled reading 
collection with CD audio is part of our library collection.    Some titles included are La Cruz del Diablo, La Casa de la Troya, El 
Libro Secreto de Daniel Torres, Sonar Un Crimen, Una Mano en la Arena, De Ratones Y Hombres, El Vendedor de Suenos.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Paste response to question here:    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ESL services are delivered through three different models of instruction, Push-in, Pull-out and in isolation. The resources 
utilized are the same as the ones used with the general population. The exception is that the delivery of instruction is 
modified, differentiated and scaffolded. For example, we have purchased the novels Of Mice and Men, Farenheit 451, and 
Bodega Dreams in Spanish to make learning accessible to our newcomers of Spanish speaking countries. This also ensures that 
no segregation or exclusion takes place within our classrooms. Instead, students feel welcomed and included and therefore 
develop the desire and motivation to learn. Students are allowed to bring the novels, in English and Spanish, home so that they 
can read at home and be as prepared as their counterparts. Additionally, to compliment instruction and achieve language 
acquisition in English, students are provided with graphic organizers and laptops with internet access to translate their work as 
much as possible. Eventually, they begin to produce sentences on their own and their partcipation is noted and acknowledged 
in class. In the middle school, textbooks and novels are grade appropriate as well. We support our ELLs via the push-in model 
on these grades, thus ESL methodologies and strategies are applied for instruction. To this end, lesson planning takes place 
collaboratively with the subject area teacher and the ESL teacher.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our activities are culturally sensitive and inclusive of all. Our Saturday Academy, AIS, food drives, guitar club, etc. are made 
available and accessible to all ELLs. We also conduct field trips that compliment academic instruction and exposes our students 
to various settings and environments. Furthermore, we coordinate assemblies and cultural feasts to expose them to American 
customs and traditions; as we also include and celebrate or acknowledge their customs and celebrations. In fact, Thanksgiving 
is one of the perfect opportunities we take to implement a food drive and a feast. Our lessons are the stage for the activities 
and we include subjects such as social studies (history), math (counting donations, paying for meals), English (reading primary 
and secondary sources, and wiritng about the content as well as our experience). We conduct a Parent Orientation session 
prior to the beginning of school. During this time, the ESL team identifies and targets the community of ELLs - parents and 
students - and our goal is to open the lines of communication and establish a healthy, long lasting relationship from the very 
start.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

This year we offer Spanish as a LOTE. Every student, regardless of linguistic abillity or ethnick background are signed-up for the 
courses. Students are exposed to Spanish language and its culture, gradually, throughout the lessons. The materials used for 
instruction include level appropriate textbooks, technology - documentaries, movies, music, etc. - art projects which include 
mask making to celebrate "El Dia De Los Muertos". To this end, although the majority of ELLs are Spanish speakers, they are 
not excluded from these courses. In fact, it instructs/teaches them academic Spanish and exposes them to other Latino 
cultures; other than their own.      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Profesional Development is provided to the entire teaching staff by members of the ESL department.  During PD staff members 
are shown specific ESL strategies to use in their classrooms, such as pre-teaching vocabulary, and chunking of extensive 
texts.  PD will also include intervisitations where teachers of ELLs will have the opportunity to visit ENL classrooms and observe 
ENL stratergies in action.  Follow up PD sessions will be given to ensure that teachers are utilizing ENL stategies successfully.

Our ENL teachers participate in a variety of network provided PDs.  This allows ENL teachers to select the PD topics that best 
suit their specific needs.     
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our guidance councilors participate in a variety of network provided PDs.  This allows the Guidance councilors to select the PD 
topics that best suit the specific needs of their population.    
 PD's will meet approximately once every six weeks and engage in an inquiry cycle to observe the effectivensess of strategies 
used in the classroom.  Records of all PD activities will be kept as evidence of attendance and topics covered.      
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ENL teachers systematically schedule meetings with all ELL parent/ guadians.  All meetings are conducted by members of our 
LPT whom are familiar with the specific needs of each student.  During conferences topics discussed include the student's 
language development across the content areas as well as their language proficiency assessment results.  In addition, program 
goals are discussed in regard to each student.  Spanish translation will be provided by either Mrs. Feliciano or Mrs. 
Perez.  Translation for other languages will be provided through use of the DOE translation services.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parent involvement is first established at the start of each school year with our Parent Orientation.  Further involvement is 
fostered through our individual parent meetings as well as through our Title III parent outreach workshop series in the spring 
where families are made aware of the specific promotion and graduation criteria for students.  Spanish translation is made 
available by either Mrs. Feliciano or Mr. Gomez during parent workshops.  In addition, all handouts are available in multiple 
languages including French, Haitan Creole, and Arabic.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, William Johnson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
