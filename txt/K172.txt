Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We are a school community that shares the common belief that all children are capable of learning at very high levels 
provided they are given the time and the expert instruction necessary to do so.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

As such, PS 172 has done a great deal to align the organizational and academic structures in our school to maximize 
our students' success. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 172 is a pre-k through 5th grade elementary school located in the heart of the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, 
New York. Sunset Park is an economically depressed, densely populated and remarkably diverse community with a 
large percentage of recent immigrants having ties to multiple ethnic groups. Our school’s population is reflective of 
this diversity with 76% of our students living at or below the poverty line and twenty-nine percent of our students 
classified as English language learners. Spanish however, is the most prevalent language spoken in our school with 
71% of our students coming from Hispanic households.  

PS 172 has been a mainstay in Sunset Park for 100+ years and is a community school in every sense of the word. Our 
school works in partnership with our students’ families as well as the Sunset Park community and has established and 
maintained a very successful partnership with Lutheran Medical Center that sponsors a school-based medical clinic 
and dental clinic and also provides on-site mental health services. Together, these programs afford our students and 
their families with primary medical and dental care as well as a certified mental health program that provides 
individual, group and family counseling to those in need. These services, in consonance with mandated services 
provided by our school based clinical speech pathologists, physical therapists and occupational therapists have 
allowed our school to be even more responsive to the needs of our students, 29% of whom have an IEP, and our 
community. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

29% of our students are English Language Learners and 29% of our students have an IEP. Both groups of learners 
require an individualized instructional program tailored to meet their specific needs. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school’s success is reflected in our most recent Quality Review Ratings in which our school received a rating of 
“well developed” on all five of the focus Quality Indicators. The area in which our school made significant strides this 
year is in the development of rigorous instruction aligned to the common core and designed to meet the specific 
needs of our students. For the coming school year, out goal is to strengthen our ability to provide a highly 
individualized and rigorous instructional program using project based learning and student self-assessment as a 
vehicle.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The Framework for Great Schools defines a successful classroom as one with a strong, common core aligned 
curriculum, customized to meet the needs of every student. At PS 172, creating an individualized, intellectually 
rigorous educational experience that both challenges and supports every learner has always been a fundamental part 
of our work. To that end we have successfully established several structures to ensure that our curriculum is both 
aligned to the common core and to our students ever changing needs. 

● May and June Planning - During our May and June planning sessions, grade level teams work together to develop 
yearlong curriculum calendars in all academic areas. These meetings begin with teachers studying common core 
curriculum standards, content standards, cumulative assessment data collected throughout the school year as well as 
initiatives introduced by the school cabinet or leadership team. After this analysis, teachers begin the planning 
process for each separate unit of study by asking and answering two essential questions: First, what is it that my 
students should know and be able to do at the end of each unit of study (and by extension, the end of the school 
year)? Second, what kinds of assessments need to be built into each unit of study to provide tangible evidence of 
students learning? Once these questions are asked and answered, teachers, coaches and administrators begin 
mapping out specific units of study and our full year curriculum calendar. 

● Weekly extended grade meetings/ Professional development work - During this time, teachers work together with 
coaches and administrators to examine and adapt current and/or upcoming units of study to meet the needs of our 
students. Curriculum adaptations are informed by a variety of assessments including, performance assessments and 
end of unit assessments. The grade level meetings are organized in a 4 week cycle to support rigorous instruction:  

1. Week 1: Review of assessment data - grading work against a rubric and using the data generated to make informed 
decisions about curriculum revision 

2. Week 2: Review or individual student data, challenges and successes. Teachers and service providers use this time 
to share insights and techniques for effective instruction 

3. Week 3: Curriculum revisions  

4. Week 4: Focused on pedagogical growth and keeping teachers engaged with their craft. During this time teachers 
may consult professional literature, engage in inter-visitations or work in a “laboratory” classroom 

The results of our work can be seen in a variety of areas: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

On the 2017 NYS Math test, 99% of our students scored at proficiency levels 3 & 4. The same data demonstrates 
growth in every sub-group of students i.e., 

● 96% of our Hispanic and Latino students scored at proficiency levels 3 & 4. 

● 94% of students with disabilities scored at proficiency level 3 & 4,  

● 100% of our Limited English Proficient students scored at levels 3 & 4, 

● 99% of economically disadvantaged students scored at proficiency levels 3 & 4, 

On the 2017 NYS ELA test, 97% of our students scored at proficiency levels 3 & 4: 

● 99% of our Hispanic and Latino students scored at proficiency levels 3 & 4. 

● 99% of students with disabilities scored at proficiency level 3 & 4. 

● 90% of our Limited English Proficient students scored at levels 3 & 4, and 

● 96% of economically disadvantaged students scored at proficiency levels 3 & 4. 

The data we collect locally supports the growth demonstrated on the State exams. For example Fountas and Pinnell 
reading level data recorded in Advance in the 2017-2018 school year indicate: 

 

 

 
 
 
 

In Kindergarten – 97.9% of our students are reading at or above their Advance Reading level goalIn first grade, 
82.5% are reading at or above grade level 
In second Grade, 65% of our student are reading at or above grade level goal 
In third grade, 92% of our students are reading at or above grade level 
In fourth Grade, 91.6% of our students are reading at or above grade level goals 
In fifth grade, 91.1% of our students ended the year reading at or above their advance reading level goal 

Our rating form for the school’s 2015 Quality Review indicates “well developed” scores for all components related to 
the instructional core. Our school’s ability to “develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how 
students learn best -that is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for teaching…” was listed as 
an area of celebration. Our focus area, selected collaboratively with the superintendent, was focused on assessment.  

We understand that when students are collaborators in assessment, they develop the habit of self-reflection. They 
learn the qualities of good work and can adjust their thinking and their work to match those qualities. Our goal will be 
to support our students in these efforts. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, the percentage of students meeting or exceeding standards on the NYS ELA will increase by 2%

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In an effort to support students to become more self reflective, 
we will conduct school-wide and grade level professional 
development sessions focused on “best practices” in using 
assessment in instruction in which teachers who are successfully 
incorporating student self assessment and share examples of 
their work and the thinking behind it.  

Design/Revise all curriculum units to integrate lessons 
incorporating student self-assessment at the outset of the unit 
and provide samples of “student (designed) rubrics” that will be 
included in all units of study. 

Design all curriculum units to be project-based and focused on 
"real-world" problems and solutions. Units will support all 
learners by incorporating presentation choices and a strong self-
assessment component. Both project and assessment 
information will be detailed at the beginning of each unit.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The Framework for Great schools defines a “Supportive Environment” as one that is student centered. A supportive 
classroom environment is one in which students take ownership of their own learning and support the learning of 
those around them, creating “a collaborative and generous atmosphere”.  

Our work in providing our students with a supportive environment has paid off. The student attendance rate for the 
year to date is 95.2%. The 2015 Quality Review reported our school as having a “well developed” school culture. In 
the NYCDOE 2015-16 School Quality Guide, 93% of our school community responded positively to questions about 
our school's "supportive environment." 

Because we recognize a supportive environment is also an engaging one, for the past 3 school years, a focus group of 
supervisors, coaches and teachers used Danielson’s Framework to look closely at component 3c: “Engaging Students 
in Learning”. The purpose of the focus group was to examine the instructional structures in place during read-aloud, 
reading workshop mini-lessons, math workshop mini-lessons and writing workshop mini-lessons and gauge the level 
and quality of student involvement in the lesson. The results of the focus group led to the following decisions: 

● Several structures in our school were instituted to ensure that each student receives the right kind of instruction at 
exactly the right time. PS 172's intervention program is one such structure. The team is structured in such a way that 
teachers are assigned to work with a specific grade level. That grade specific designation is critical to the success of 
our program for two reasons. First, intervention teachers share their common preps with their grade level team. This 
allows intervention teachers the opportunity to plan and consult with classroom teachers on a daily basis. Secondly, 
the grade level designation is important because it allows our teachers the freedom to push in to specific classrooms 
on a daily basis, get to know those students and work with them without having to pull them away from the ongoing 
instruction in their classroom. During the time they push into a classroom, intervention teachers act as a second 
classroom teacher, providing a mini-lesson to a small group of students, followed by work with a guided group as well 
as individual conferences. The students that are selected to work with the intervention teacher may represent a wide 
variety of student subgroups. Students are chosen, not for their designation as an English language learner, a special 
education student or as “at-risk” but are chosen because assessment data shows that they have a demonstrated 
need. The groups are flexible and change from unit to unit or from guided group to guided group. The mini-lesson led 
by the intervention teacher is based on the same skills, and/or the same content studied by the larger classroom 
group. The individualization comes from the choice of instructional materials, the amount or type of background 
provided for the lesson or the amount of teacher support provided in the lesson. Related service providers are 
another key component in this program. Speech services, counseling and even occupational therapy are provided as a 
push-in service. In this model, service providers join an individual or small group of mandated students to further 
scaffold the work the child is engaged in. 

 In mathematics, we have restructured Engage NY lessons to better support a constructivist model of instruction. 
Units have been designed to launch with a math project providing students with a "real-world" application for the 
mathematics and providing teachers with formative assessment data. Lessons begin with a complex problem in a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

more relate-able scenario. Students are then invited to solve the problem using any variety of strategies and/or 
manipulatives. Teachers present student work (along with the student) to the class in order to purposefully examine 
the strategies, methods and process the student or students used to successfully solve the problem(s) and to launch 
the connected lesson. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will increase the level of student engagement as demonstrated by a 2% increase in the number of 
teachers rated in Advance as highly effective.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Provide grade specific intervention teachers for each grade level 
(k-5) and schedule all professional development sessions so that 
intervention teachers become an integral part of the professional 
work of the grade. 

Continue to revise “Engage NY Math” curriculum to better 
support the constructivist philosophy and incorporate "real-
world" projects 

Organize mandated service provider’s schedule to support a 
push-in program that is supportive of the school’s intervention 
program and addresses the needs of students with disabilities 
and English Language Learners . 

Because interventions teachers will become the 2 nd teacher in 
the room, conducting lessons, conferences, etc.… , teachers will 
work together to group students flexibly to meet their individual 
needs as learners.

According to the Framework for Great Schools, collaborative teachers consistently improve their practice through 
ongoing learning and professional development. This spirit of collaboration is strength for PS 172.  

● According to our 2015-16 NYC School Survey, 97% of teachers reponded positively to questions about rigorous 
instruction 

● According to our 2015-16 NYC School Survey, 100% of our teachers would recommend our school to parents. 

● Our May 2015 Quality Review listed our ability to engage in structured professional collaborations as “well 
developed” 

A review of the systems and structures used to support Collaborative Teachers reveals: 

● Instructional Coaches -To support our teachers in their pedagogical work, PS 172 employs four coaches. There is 
one literacy and one math coach in the upper grades (3-5) and one literacy and one math coach in the lower grades 
(pre-k-2). The coaches support teachers individually and also work with supervisors to provide a more collective 
approach to professional development.  

When working with a teacher individually, coaches consider classroom observation data, a teacher’s personal goals 
and the school’s goals as related by the CEP. Coaches work with teachers to flesh out their pedagogical goal(s) and set 
up short and long-range benchmarks against which they can assess their progress. A professional development plan is 
developed in which the work that the coach and teacher will engage in, is laid out in more specific terms and 
approved by school supervisors. 

● Weekly extended grade meetings -In the current configuration for extended grade meetings, coaches work with 
their supervisors and teachers to examine and adapt current and/or upcoming units of study to meet the needs of our 
students. Curriculum adaptations are informed by a variety of assessments including, performance assessments and 
end of unit assessments. The grade level meetings are organized in a 4 week cycle: 

1. Week 1: Review of assessment data - grading work against a rubric and using the data generated to make informed 
decisions about curriculum revision 

2. Week 2: Review of individual student data, challenges and successes. Teachers and service providers use this time 
to share insights and techniques for effective instruction 

3. Week 3: Curriculum revisions

4. Week 4 focused on pedagogical growth. During this time teachers may consult professional literature, engage in 
inter-visitations or work in a “laboratory” classroom 

During our mid-May grade conferences, administrators and coaches asked teachers for feedback about PS 172’s 
professional development program, eliciting their specific ideas for improvement. An overwhelming majority of 
teachers advocated for an increase in the time used for our weekly extended grade meetings be devoted to 
pedagogical growth and to increase opportunities to visit other classrooms. To address this need, next year's cycle of 
weekly extended grade meetings will feature 2 sessions focused on pedagogical growth. Next year's 4 week cycle will 
be organized in the following way: 

1.  Week 1: Review of grade level assessment data and review of individual student data. 
2.  Week 2: Curriculum Revisions 
3.  Week 3: Pedagogical Growth ( During this time teachers may consult professional literature, engage in inter-

visitations or work in a “laboratory” classroom) 

4.  Week 4: Pedagogical Growth ( During this time teachers may consult professional literature, engage in inter-

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At PS 172 we commit to investing the time and resources necessary to truly nurture pedagogical growth. This idea is 
communicated in both word and deed in a variety of ways: 

● PS 172 employs 4 coaches; 2 coaches in pre-k through 2 nd grade, one working in math, the other in literacy and 2 
coaches working with the teachers in grades 3-5 also in literacy and mathematics. Each coach works with grade level 
teams as well as individual teachers working in cycles of professional study lasting 4 weeks. 

● Both the principal and the assistant principal work with teachers and coaches at all extended grade specific 
professional development sessions. 

● PS 172’s School Based Option – The teachers at PS172 are truly devoted to the needs of our students and our school 
community. They are equally committed to their own professional growth. PS 172’s SBO is evidence of this 
commitment. Long before the UFT approved their most recent contract, shifting 150 minutes of instructional time to 
time for professional development, PS 172 had already been engaged in weekly, extended professional development. 
The grade specificity of the professional time allowed for grade level teachers to work with both supervisors and 
coaches on a weekly basis. This grade specificity was absent from the School Based Options presented by the UFT and 
for this reason our teachers fought to create an SBO that would enable them to maintain their trajectory of 
professional growth. 

Ultimately, the teachers succeeded in developing an SBO that includes a grade-specific period 1 common prep that is 
used to extend the daily 30-minute professional development time into an 80-minute weekly block of professional 
development time. Intervention staff at the school are “grade specific” and work collaboratively with their grade level 
peers during that time. 

According to data communicated in the 2015-2016 NYC school survey: 

● 98% of teachers agree or strongly agree that the school principal communicates a clear vision for our school 

● 98% of teachers agree or strongly agree that the principal communicates a clear vision for the school 

● 100% agree that the principal sets high standards for student learning 

Collaboration and high expectations have resulted in PS 172 being ranked as one of highest performing elementary 
school in NYS based on results from the 2015-2016 NYS reading and math assessments.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24 

 

In the spirit of collaboration, the focus area identified on our 2015 Quality review, which was selected together with 
the superintendent, the principal, the assistant principal and coaches was focused on student self assessment – 
inviting students to become more inclusive and active members of our school community. 

To look more closely at student self-assessment, Advance teacher observation data was reviewed. The data revealed 
that while all of our teachers were deemed effective in the area of “using assessment in instruction”, only 43% of 
those ratings were labeled as highly effective. While this data shows a 15% increase from the 2013-2014 school year, 
students were still not consistently part of designing their own assessment criteria in all subject areas. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the

and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the number of teachers receiving an Advance rating of “highly effective” in the area of “using assessment 
in instruction” will increase by 5%.

It is essential that every school build effective family and community partnerships focused on helping students 
achieve. To that end, the leadership team spent time reviewing our current school structures and programs as well as 
parent responses on the 2015-2016 School Survey Report. Our review of that data revealed: 

School Survey Data  

● 99% of parents agree or strongly agree that  

-Teachers work closely with families to meet students' needs 

-Communicate regularly with parents/guardians about how staff can help students learn 

-Parents are greeted warmly when they call or visit the school 

-Teachers try to understand families' problems and concerns 

School Structures and Programs  

● At the beginning of every school year, each classroom teacher hosts a curriculum orientation meeting, unveiling our 
yearly curricula in all major subject areas. This orientation is followed up with monthly, grade specific curriculum 
meetings scheduled to follow our PTA meetings and additional meetings held during the 40 minutes of parent 
involvement time scheduled from 8:00 to 8:40 am. During each of these meetings, a grade level representative 
specifies the skills, strategies and content that will be covered in the units of study for the coming month. Here, 
parents are also introduced to the end of unit assessment their child will be taking to assess their proficiency with the 
skills and strategies taught in the unit. Information about each end of unit assessment is accompanied by the rubric 
that teachers will use to grade the work as well as anchor papers to provide parents with work samples that 
demonstrate the work we expect students to complete in order to meet or exceed grade level standards.  

● Each grade level (pre-k through 5 th ) has developed a Class - Dojo account that is updated daily with specific 
curriculum and assessment information for parents as well as resources for families to better access the curriculum. 

● PS 172 creates a custom progress report which really details the skills and standards students are expected to meet 
and or exceed by the end of the school year.  

● The last Friday of every month, PS 172 hosts “Parents as Learning Partners”. As a learning partner, parents spend 
time learning alongside their child in their classroom, experiencing lessons in a variety of subject areas. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28 

 

● Our school has a long-standing partnership with Lutheran Medical Center. Lutheran maintains several offices at our 
school and provides our families with on-site medical care from a nurse practitioner, on-site dental care and mental 
health services for our students and their families. 

● PS 172 has a newly established relationship with NYU’s Art Therapy Program. Our visual arts teacher is a certified 
art therapist and is also certified to provide supervision to art therapist interns from NYU. In addition, our visual arts 
teacher works with at-risk students in our school for 5 periods weekly, providing another venue for therapeutic 
intervention and helping to maintain healthy, well adjusted students that come to school ready to learn. 

Last year, the NYC School Survey indicated that 46% of parents selected a “stronger arts program” as an improvement 
they would most like our school to make. 

In the 2015-2016 school year, PS 172 has taken some steps to address this need by establishing a separate art studio, 
a dance space and music program (both choral and instrumental). In addition, we have also worked to expand our 
after school “arts-centered” offerings. In the 2017-2018 school year we plan to continue with this work by 
incorporating the arts as an integral part of our project based learning initiative across all grade levels.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
A highly qualified teacher knows what to teach, how to teach, and has a full understanding of the subject matter 
being taught. Our school embraces the notion that the most effective way to improve the achievement of students is 
to improve the quality of teaching. We do this in several ways: 

● The school employs 4 content area coaches. Two coaches, one for math, the other for literacy, work with teachers 
in pre-k through 2 nd grade. Two additional coaches, also for math and literacy, work with teachers in grades 3-5. 

● Coaches act as mentors for all new teachers. 

● Appoint Grade specific leaders in math, reading, writing, social studies and science to act as mentors to their fellow 
teachers on the grade. These curriculum leadership roles are awarded to teachers because of their demonstrated 
excellence in the specific subject area. 

● Include highly skilled service providers (Speech Therapist, Occupational Therapst, Physical Therapist, ESL teacher) in 
the grade level work of designing and/or revising curricula. Their input ensures that our lessons are inclusive for all 
learners. 

● Study groups and inquiry groups are developed with a teacher’s specific needs in mind. We use our students’ 
learning challenges as well as the pedagogical or content based challenges our staff face to generate the questions 
our study and inquiry groups are based on.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
To support teachers, paraprofessionals and staff in their pedagogical growth, the following structures are in place: 

Teacher Development of Personal Pedagogical Goals and Objectives:  

 All teachers begin the school year with an initial principal meeting in September to discuss and outline 1-2 personal, 
pedagogical goals designed to ultimately improve their practice as well as student outcomes. This teacher meeting is a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

follow up of sorts from the previous school year’s evaluative conversation with the principal. In this September 
meeting, teachers set forth their goals and an action plan to reach them. These goals are supportive of the school’s 
goals for the year. This year they were centered on specific areas of student self-assessment and questioning. 

To support staff members, teachers are matched with a literacy and/or math coach to support their work in fleshing 
out their goal(s) and setting up short and long-range benchmarks against which they can assess their progress. A 
professional development plan is developed in which the work that the coach and teacher will engage in, is laid out in 
more specific terms and approved by school supervisors.  

Pedagogical Improvement Plans Based on Classroom Observations  

 Observations completed by supervisors are discussed with coaches in weekly cabinet meetings. During these 
meetings, specific observations are discussed, classroom data is reviewed and as such, teachers’ needs are prioritized. 
These discussions form the basis for Individual (and sometimes small group) cycles of professional development. Each 
cycle lasts approximately 4-6 weeks and is anchored in much the same way our Teachers’ Personal Pedagogical Goals 
are - with a professional development plan.  

Weekly Grade Level Professional Development  

 Teachers, paraprofessionals, coaches and supervisors meet for 80 minutes weekly for grade level professional 
development sessions. One meeting each month involves the team working together to examine student work against 
an established rubric(s) and/or examining data collected from a variety of sources. The data is then used to make a 
variety of decisions- Including:  

 How to address a specific student’s needs  

 How to better scaffold or modify a lesson, task or unit of study support a variety of learners.  

 How to better group students for instruction0.  

 What changes should be made in the next unit of study to better address the needs of students?  

 What changes should be made in the curriculum for next year?

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
Pre-school teachers and paraprofessionals take part in the same school-wide professional development as the 
teachers in the elementary program – full-day professional development sessions focus on differentiating instruction 
and planning meaningful, rigorous units aligned to the common core. Our literacy coach meets weekly with Pre-K– 2 
teachers, and these meetings focus on curriculum development, teaching methods, and analyzing student data to 
inform instruction. Focused parent workshops are offered each month by the literacy coach and pre-school social 
worker. These workshops build parent’s understanding of what students need to be successful in elementary school, 
and how they can support healthy development and learning at home. As such, curricula and appropriately effective 
teaching practices such as Read Aloud, Readers’ Workshop, Math Constructive Approaches are aligned to provide 
each learner a coherent transition throughout the school year and to the next grade. All data gathered throughout the 
year is passed on to the next year’s instructors as well as service providers.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers are involved in all decisions about what assessment measures will be used. At PS 172, all teachers 
participate in the creation of a curriculum based on standards that is customized to meet the needs of our students. 
Consequently, they are the developers of the assessment measures as well. For example, Benchmark as well as mid 
and end of unit assessments are designed by teachers and coaches during May and June curriculum planning. These 
decisions are reviewed by coaches and supervisors for their effectiveness and revised as necessary during the 80 
minutes weekly professional development meetings throughout the school year. Decisions are constantly assessed as 
teachers bring student work and data to these meetings to reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching, and, if 
necessary, to create plans for reassessment of particular students or classes.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS172, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

As per the most recently administered Spring 2018 NYSESLAT and fall NYSITELL results, one 
hundred and forty-three (143) students in K-5 have been identified as English Language Learners 
(ELLs). Our ESL after school program invites 17 Entering and Emerging Kindergarten Students, 
as well as 43 Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding First Graders, 24 second graders 
(also all levels), and 14 Entering, Emerging and Transitioning students in 3-5. Our 24 Expanding 
students in 3-5 will be invited to our Saturday Academy. 
 
Our 3 ENL certified teachers and one bilingual teacher will teach a total of 12 hours a week for 
16 weeks, November 5th –April 15th, providing a total of 216 hours of instruction. Our 
afterschool programs begin at 3:05 and end at 4:05 or 5:05. Our first certified teacher will service 
1 Kindergarten group for two hours per week, and one 3-5 group for 2 hours per week. Our 
second certified teacher will service two first grade groups two hours per week. Our third 
certified teacher will service 1 first grade group one hour per week, and 2 second grade groups 
two hours per week. Our bilingual teacher will service our newly arrived entering and emerging 
ELLs in grades 3-5 for one hour per week. One ENL certified teacher will be instructing in our 
Saturday Academy from 9am-12am from February 9th- April 6th for a total of 24 hours. 
 
All programs are provided in English. To more effectively prepare all of our students and 
particularly our ELLs, we implement a structured multi-sensory phonemic awareness Fundations 
program in grades K-3, and a themed Read Aloud Curriculum, developed at our school, which 
provides students with rich text sets and hands-on experiences and visual support that help 
students delve deeply into content area topics to develop core knowledge and engage in deep 
discussions about each topic. Our ENL after school programming builds on this curriculum. Our 
ENL and bilingual teacher, in communication with the classroom teachers, coaches, and service 
providers where applicable, develop word study and read aloud materials that preview, review, 
or extend the topics students are studying in class, and provide more intensive and targeted 
intervention, particularly in the areas of word study and vocabulary. Tier I and Tier II vocabulary 
(content area vocabulary as well as academic vocabulary) is a key part of all read aloud planning, 
and words are presented and explained with visual supports, and teachers model proper use of 
the vocabulary and support students’ use of these words. In addition, our ENL and bilingual 
teachers collaborate with classroom teachers, coaches, and providers to create targeted guided 
reading plans to support students’ decoding and comprehension of leveled books, including 
Rigby PM, Rigby PM Stars, and On Our Way to English. Writing is developed usually in 
response to read aloud or to independent reading, and is scaffolded as needed with graphic 
organizers and sentence starters, as well as teacher prompting students to speak about the texts 
(using these supports) always in complete sentences. 
 
Instructional materials to support the literacy development of our Title III student participants 
include Reading A-Z, which can be accessed in Spanish or English, to support work in ELA as 
well as content areas. In Math our Title III students will be given access to online programs like

Zearn which support and extend our current mathematics curriculum, and which provide parents 
videos and examples of mathematics strategies taught. 
 
Attendance is taken for each group by the assigned teacher, and shared weekly with coaches and 
the office staff. Progress monitoring will be continuous, with teachers assessing students’ use of 
vocabulary, participation in interactive read aloud and discussion, as well as students’ progress in 
reading and writing (decoding, encoding, sentence meaning and sentence construction, paragraph 
writing). Progress will be shared regularly with classroom teachers so that together, the ESL 
teacher and classroom teacher determine and work toward specific goals for each child. In this 
way, groups are flexible across the year. The materials are an extension of the students’ studies 
in class, so rather than introducing brand new topics, our program deepens the language and 
content understanding of topics studied in each grade. The teachers will, however, pull from 
other resources as they see fit, especially in the case of a student brand new to the country who is 
lacking the vocabulary and background knowledge needed to access the grade level curriculum. 
 
To support families, all curriculum topics and skills are translated and shared with parents in a 
variety of ways. These include our school website that details curriculum themes and is updated 
monthly, as well as Class and School Dojo messages that provide daily support. Further parent 
support is offered during monthly in-person workshops, held at the grade level, and translated for 
all parents. Literature from each workshop is passed along to all parents, even those who could 
not attend. Finally, one-on-one meetings occur regularly between teachers and parents, always 
with a translator as needed, during our weekly family involvement period, in addition to teacher 
preparation periods and afterschool meetings across the year. All program schedules as well as 
changes/announcements are shared in families’ home language through written notices as well 
messaging through Class Dojo and Remind 101.

Professional Development or as we refer at P.S. 172 Collaborative Professional Growth is a most 
important component of our academic success at P.S. 172.  It’s a key element to the academic 
learning of our English Language Learners. The four (4) teachers in the Title III After School 
and Saturday funded services as well as all our teacher will receive support from the supervisor, 
from colleagues and literacy and math coaches who regularly work with our professionals on 
effective strategies to differentiate teaching for immigrant learners.  Ongoing professional 
development includes weekly 80 minute professional development meetings with coaches and 
supervisors. While all of our professional development is curated to support best practices with 
our student population (approximately 26% ELLs and 29% students with IEPs), it should be 
noted that at least one of these 80 minute sessions each month is dedicated to student study, 
where teachers, coaches, speech therapists, counselors, and administrators gather to discuss, 
strategize, and model best practices for students not making adequate progress. In addition, our 
coaches review student achievement data monthly, and meet individually with teachers to make 
adjustments to curriculum and teaching so that all students meet school benchmarks as well as 
Common Core standards across the year. Records of the weekly PD meetings (attendance and

agendas) as well as one-on-one data review and teaching strategy meetings are maintained by our 
coaches and shared with administrators at weekly Cabinet meetings. As delineated previously, 
literacy skills and content knowledge will be broken down on the basis of the analysis conducted 
of the NYSTILL, NYSESLAT and end-of-units assessments results.  Professional Development 
decisions will be made on the basis of the results.  It is anticipated that specific areas of growth 
include: effective instructional approaches in the read-aloud such as providing interactive 
presentations around vocabulary as well as scaffolds for student conversation and written 
response, analyzing texts for sentence structure and vocabulary; increasing phonemic awareness 
skills by integrating meaningful movements with the letter-sound practice, improving and 
increasing teaching in core subject areas through content-based read alouds as well as instruction 
through other media such as videos and websites, and assessment methods that allow teachers to 
provide up-to-date individualized instruction for each child.

Begin description here:            
To further extend positive learning practices at home for our ELLs, we offer a parent class 
parallel to our Saturday Academy, from February 9th to April 6th from 9am to 11pm.  There is 
no cost to parents for participation in the program, and it will be made available to parents of 
Ells. Invitations will be sent out in parents’ home language, and attendance and agendas kept by 
the instructors. Instructional Materials for Parents’ Literacy include Core Knowledge Series, 
videos, and software programs such as the Rosetta Stone Language Program. Parents are also 
introduced to translation software and programs they can access at home. This will all be 
available in English and Spanish as well as other languages spoken by the targeted population. 
 
To help further transition parents and to help them better support their child’s academic success, 
these workshops offer instruction in using technology for everyday use, (navigating the internet 
to find local news, community resources, and relevant community events and information) as 
well as to support the student’s academic subject areas they’ll be studying at home. Areas of 
need as shared in parent surveys include using technology in Math and ENL.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The school uses multiple formative and curriculum embedded assessments to guide our instructional planning for ELLs. To 
measure reading comprehension, word attack, and fluency, teachers rely on three forms of assessments used throughout the 
year; Fountas and Pinnell, our own benchmark books (books representative of each reading level, with standardized questions 
and a rubric for student interviews upon completion of the book) as well as ongoing conferring notes where teachers indicate 
students’ mastery of essential reading skills (determining importance, monitoring for meaning, inferring, accumulating the 
text, envisioning, interpreting).  
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

We have many structures in place to support this effort. Each month, teachers report levels to the cabinet team (Principal, 
Assistant Principal, coaches) and these are reviewed and interpreted to make grade-wide and individual teacher staff 
development plans. Furthermore, the school has a dedicated intervention/collaborative teacher for each grade, and each 
grade is provided common prep periods at least 4 out of 5 days in the week. Teachers use this time, as well as their 
professional time, to review conferring notes and make individual, small group, and whole class instructional plans for 
students. These collaborative planning periods are often attended by the coach, who reviews conferring notes at least once a 
month and who supports these efforts. Finally, each grade meets for an 80 minute block of professional development time per 
week, during which coaches, the assistant principal, and often our related service providers join teachers to review student 
work, interpret data to inform and revise instructional plans, and learn about as well as try out best pedagogical practices, 
particularly those practices most effective with ENLs and students with IEPs. 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We create our own summative assessments, including Benchmark Books, as well as end of unit assessments. Our Benchmark 
books, described above, offer standardized questions that give teachers data about each reading skill. Therefore, teachers can 
compare growth in levels, as well as growth in particular skill areas. Additionally, we develop end of unit assessments in the 
areas of reading, writing, and math. These assessments are aligned to common core standards for the grade, and are 
organized by skill across the year so teachers can measure and compare growth.   
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

What structures do you have in place to address interventions once summative data has been gathered? We have a few 
structures in place to address interventions. Our intervention/collaborative teachers are grade dedicated and therefore attend 
grade specific PD, and they follow the schedule of their grade colleagues and so share a minimum of 4 common preps a week. 
These opportunities for planning are maximized by the presence of the AP or the coach at all 80 minute weekly PD meetings, 
as well as a minimum of one common planning period a week. During these planning and professional development sessions, 
teachers and coaches review summative data and make relevant adjustments to whole class and small group plans. Another 
important structure in place is our Tier I and Tier II system. At least 4 times a year, in addition to parent conferences, teachers 
identify – through the use of summative assessment data – students are who approaching standards (Tier II) and students who 
are far below standards (Tier I). Once students are identified, classroom teachers, in collaboration with collaborative teachers, 
related service providers, ENL providers, and our literacy and math coaches, develop specific individual intervention plans for 
each student. The plans focus on S.M.A.R.T goals for each student in each subject area of need, and include both a home and a 
school component, as well as ongoing assessments of the target skill areas. Plans are reviewed by coaches and assistant 
principal, and then shared with parents at an in-person meeting. Assessment results, as well as updated plans as needed, are 
shared with parents after a period of 8-10 weeks. Finally, our collaborative push-in schedule (intervention teachers, related 
service providers, ENL providers) is flexible across subject area, so that support can be given at the right time in the right area 
for each child.  
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 
We use various forms of data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention. We begin with the use of the 
Home Language Survey, as well as each student’s NYSLAT scores. In addition, we rely on the formative and summative 
assessments described above to determine the needs of each child, and to plan to relevant instruction each child needs. 
Teacher professional development focuses on many of the best practices when working with linguistically diverse student 
bodies, as outlined by the Center for Research on Education, Diversity, and Excellence. 
 
These are: 
Teachers and students producing together. Each unit of study launches in a constructivist style, where students and teachers 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

engage in problem-solving, inquiry, or task-based lessons where students work together with the teacher to make meaning, 
ask questions, and develop their own strategies for solving problems. This takes the form of a seminar-style series of lessons, a 
close-reading of a complex text, or a performance task. 
 
Developing language and literacy across the curriculum. In our school, many of our units are interdisciplinary, where students 
study a topic across texts and contexts. Many themes launch in our read aloud, and as the study develops the students take on 
research, writing, and/or performance  or problem-solving in the areas of reading, writing, math, and the arts. Studies vary 
from 2-6 weeks, allowing students sufficient time to immerse themselves in a topic, and each topic is supported (for ENLs but 
also all students) with vocabulary supports and visuals identified by our grade teams to be essential for expertise and 
understanding of the topic. 
 
Making lessons meaningful. Many of our units are project-based, and all of them invite and support students in connecting the 
study to their own lives, and/or the school community. Many of the studies launch with an artifact or an experience where 
students have the opportunity to question and respond to new information, and our teacher work with their responses to help 
drive and shape the rest of the study. 
 
Teaching complex thinking. All of our units are common-core aligned, and students are exposed to high-level texts, critical 
thinking questions, and application problems. As needed, support such as vocabulary, scaffolded questions, organizers, smaller 
group instruction etc, are offered, but the tasks themselves are not simplified for ENLs or any other student group. 
 
Teaching through conversation. Student to student and student to teacher conversation is valued across the school and an 
integrated into all curriculum areas. Our school dedicates a full period each day to read aloud, for which the conversation is a 
pivotal part. Students set class and individual goals for rich conversation and discussion, and these goals are addressed across 
the day and in each curriculum area. Furthermore, our project-based units provide ongoing – not only end of unit – 
opportunities for students to question, process, and express what they are learning. 
 
Ongoing assessments to assess, track, and remediate for students not making adequate progress at any point during the 
year.  First, units are designed with assessment in mind. Teachers use Fountas and Pinnell to track formal reading levels, but in 
addition they administer end of unit assessments each month, and keep detailed records on weekly conferences which are 
shared with all providers (intervention teachers, related service providers, etc). Word study and vocabulary assessments are 
given every week to monitor word knowledge, and students not showing progress are provided with a “double dose” of word 
study instruction during or after school, as needed. Mid and end of unit math assessments, as well as daily exit tickets, inform 
teachers as to which students met the objective for the day, and this information is used to create groups as well as additional 
review homework or extensions.  In writing, teachers plan for “checkpoints” across the unit to collect and assess student 
drafts, and they grade end of unit writing publications as well as “on-demand” writing across the year and across subjects. 
Assessment results are shared formally at weekly professional development meetings, and are also submitted to coaches on a 
monthly basis.  
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use a variety of outcome assessments to evaluate and inform our programs. We use the proficiency levels from the 
NYSESLAT from Spring 2017 NYSESLAT data to determine the level of need for each student in the coming year, and to 
measure our own effectiveness in ELL programing and support. Based on the identified need, we provide after-school and 
Saturday instruction, as well as targeted teacher development and collaborative planning with our ENL providers, all other 
related service providers, and classroom teachers. ELA and Mathematics exam results help us further reflect on the 
effectiveness of our program for our ELLs. As these results are broken down by subgroup, and by section (multiple choice, 
short response, essay, etc) we are able to identify areas of success and challenge for our ELLs and similarly, we provide a 
combination of additional instruction as well as teacher development so that the instruction across the day is increased in 
quantity and quality. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

To disseminate our findings, we do the following: 
 
The entire school community is provided with an ELL list which is updated regularly as students are discharged or admitted. 
Reflections, described in the question above, are shared at the beginning of the school year and goal for our ELL instruction are 
integrated into our school-wide pedagogical goals each fall. The structure of weekly grade-dedicated professional 
development meetings allow for coaches, assistant principals, and ENL providers to visit grade meetings regularly to support 
differentiation and scaffolding for ELLs on all levels, across grades and subject areas.  
 
 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The push-in ENL program was organized to service ELLs in groups respective of their grade level. This organization 
facilitates the plan for academic language development, as the strategies being taught in the grade level classroom 
will be reinforced by the push-in ENL teacher within our balanced literacy instructional model.  While working within 
the construct of this model, the ENL teacher utilizes methodologies and approaches recommended for our language 
learners such as, total physical response and language experience approach.  These approaches are supported with a 
variety of technological approaches (computers, personal audio recorders etc…). 
 
            ENL teachers, intervention teachers and classroom teachers meet weekly with the literacy coach and the 
assistant principal to discuss and coordinate the plans for the coming week in reading, writing, math and/or social 
studies. 
            Plan includes: 
 
            P.S. 172 has heterogeneously grouped classes in grades K-5. However, our ENL groups are arranged according 
to proficiency level and grade level. The student’s proficiency levels are based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results.   
 
            The ENL teacher pushes into each class for 50-minute periods every day, usually the push-in/pull-out is 
scheduled to occur during reader’s workshop and writer’s workshop, and it may also be scheduled around specific 
units in social studies and science. Teachers work with students in guided lessons, introducing vocabulary, building 
background knowledge, exploring words and word solving strategies and developing fluency and comprehension.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

In order to meet the linguistic needs of our ELLs, parental choice and part 154 mandates, P.S. 172’s language allocation policy 
will consist of an ENL program in which entering and emerging level students will receive 360 minutes of ENL instruction per 
week (180 minutes of standalone and 180 minutes of integrated instruction). Students who score at transitioning and 
expanding will receive 180 minutes per week of integrated instruction of both ENL and ELA instruction separately. Students 
who scored at commanding level will receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction per week. Our two ENL/Intervention 
teachers push in to work with every ENL student in a ratio of 13 students per teacher for multiple 50-minute periods in order 
to meet the mandated instructional time of either 360 or 180 minutes per week. Instruction takes place during readers, 
writers, and math workshop time.  Students with a entering or emerging proficiency level are also supported in a two day a 
week / One hour and 30 minutes per day, after school program and a three hour Saturday program. Each teacher has a set 
program to appropriately provide the highest quality of instructional support to scaffold each learner to meet and exceed 
English language standards.  
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Our parents at choose the Freestanding ENL model. At our school, this means that ENL, intervention providers, all other 
related service providers as well as classroom teachers collaborate daily to develop differentiated lesson plans that address 
content as well as the skills of common core.  Instruction is delivered in English only. In order to make content comprehensible 
for the ESL student, materials and student interaction with materials are both differentiated by the ENL teacher as well as by 
all teachers in our building. For example, teachers will scaffold a difficult text with a preview of vocabulary as well as content, 
and will help students connect the new information to something they already know. They will often select a similarly themed 
text on an easier reading level so students can more independently read for information in the content areas. Teachers seek 
out videos as well as books and articles read aloud on the I-pad to present content information where student reading would 
be too frustrating for the English Language Learner. To support language development, teachers provide content as well as 
skill-based vocabulary (for example, vocabulary related to the Colonial Period, but also academic vocabulary that supports 
students discussion of cause and effect, sequence, comparisons, etc.) Teachers provide sentences starters for students in 
discussion as well as written work. 
 
Because content area instruction in so interwoven into our English Language Arts program, some strategies that will be used 
are already part of the balanced literacy effective teaching practices.  These practices include: individual assessment through 
conferencing, scaffolding, multi-cultural and literature-rich classroom libraries in English (with texts available in the native 
language as well), lending libraries for home, audio/listening centers, word wall (with visual aids), flow of the day (with visual 
aids), charts modeling correct language use, and strategy charts reflective of current units of study in reading, writing and 
math, science and social studies. 
 
Our school uses sheltered English instruction within a structured immersion instructional format, allowing for more 
individualized instruction.  ENL students are also provided with a “pre-teaching” outline prior to all content area 
lessons.  These outlines are constructed by teachers and review vocabulary, provide students with visual supports for the 
lesson and include an overall review of the content.  The benefit of these outlines is that they can be customized to meet the 
academic needs of each student, allowing our English language learners to participate more fully in the lessons.  
 
English Language Learners participate in all school-created assessments that measure achievement of the CCLS. We ensure 
that students not only participate but meet or excel standards on these assessments by providing the scaffolding mentioned 
above during daily instructional times, but also by providing similar scaffolding for each assessment. For example, vocabulary 
will be previewed and clearly defined. Sentence starters may be provided. In addition, as for all students but particularly 
benefitting our ELLs, our school provides an element of student choice in performance assessments and projects, so each child

has the opportunity to choose the content and the format used to demonstrate their learning.  
 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

At P.S. 172, we ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language, by screening them during the interview 
process. During the interview we are able to determine what language the child is fluent in.   English Language Learners are 
monitored monthly to better document their progress in the following areas: overall language performance, oral 
communication skills, reading skills, and use of comprehension strategies. Additionally, students are assessed at least 3 times 
across the year by native language screeners (teachers whose native language is Spanish, or an outside screener if the child’s 
native language is other than Spanish). For example, students are given book in their native language so that fluency, 
decoding, and comprehension can be measured.   
   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
At the beginning of each school year, each teacher receives a list of their English Language learners, which designates their 
level of language acquisition (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding). All ENLs receive testing 
accommodations of time and a half. 
 
5a.       Though we do not currently service students with interrupted Formal Education (SIFEs), our plan provides for these 
students to receive after school and Saturday intervention programs to support additional academic enrichment.  A structured 
immersion instructional program will allow for students to receive instruction that is tailored to specifically meet their needs. 
 
5b.       Like SIFE students, newcomers receive daily instruction using Methodologies and approaches such as Total Physical 
Response (TPR).  A Whole Language is used to build social and academic vocabulary. Communicative Language Teaching will be 
used where the use of the student’s native language is accepted during the early stages of language learning.  A wide range of 
materials will be used to support instruction such as visual aids, manipulatives (particularly to reinforce letter-sound 
relationships), big books, vocabulary cards, various word study activity kits and texts with audio supplements.  For students 
expected to participate in ELA testing (after one year of English Language Instruction), intervention programs during the school 
day and after school and on Saturdays, address grade specific needs in reading, writing and listening. 
 
 
5c.       For 4-6 year ELLs, students are supported in their literacy skills as well as their skills in English language acquisition. 
Individualized intervention plans are developed to support their academic success.   Much of what students work on here is in 
the area of writing.  Our work here includes: 
 
5d        Currently we do not service any long term ELLs. We do however have a program in place to support those students 
when the need arises. Long term ELL’s continue to receive academic support through small group intervention and after school 
and Saturday school programs. A structured immersion instructional program will allow for students to receive instruction that 
is tailored to specifically meet their needs. 
 
5e        For students reaching proficiency, we will offer priority in after school programs as well as individualized educational 
plans. Furthermore, because PS 172 has such a high ELL population, our entire school’s curriculum is geared toward and 
flexible for English Language Learners regardless of their classification, while still maintaining the high standards delineated in 
the common core. For example, even in grades 3, 4, and 5 where many of our students have tested proficient, we provide the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

same robust vocabulary program, the weekly grammar and sentence instruction during Weekend News, the intensive small-
group instruction for any students in need of additional support but especially for our ELLs, in addition to a small-group Read 
Aloud in most classes so that when students are reading and/or listening to a complex text they are given the most support. 
These students also will continue to receive test modifications (as appropriate) including time and half, separate location, 
directions read aloud, listening passages read aloud 3x, for up to 2 years after testing out. Former ENLs are offered services 
and testing modifications for two years after testing out. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At the beginning of the school year, classroom teachers, collaborative teachers, as well as ENL teachers spend time reviewing 
all IEPs including ELL-SWD’s. Teachers of ELL-SWD’s have access to a variety of materials that specifically address the multi-
sensory needs of ELL-SWD’s.  Grade level materials are created as a by-product of our annual grade level teams curricula 
mapping work.  Charts, handouts or any curriculum related material can be transcribed and/or translated for students as part 
of their reading/writing toolkit.  
 
Our kindergarten through third grade word study curriculum is a modified version of Fundations, a multisensory phonemic 
awareness program.  Very often, our ELL-SWD take advantage of our “double-dose” fundations program, which provides for 
more instructional time in an after-school setting or in small groups during the day. 
 
The IEP’s of our English language learners have the benefit of being co-created by our ENL teacher, our school based support 
team, classroom teachers and service providers.  Instructions for both programs are provided using a push-in model. 
 
Each classroom in equipped with a Smart-board, at least 3-7 I-pads, and at least 5-7 laptops. Teachers integrate technology 
into their daily lesson planning, but also into their plans for student independent and small group work. For example, a student 
just learning to read in English who can comprehend at higher level will listen to a book read to them on the I-pad for part of 
the independent reading period. On another day, they’ll work with apps on the I-pad to develop vocabulary, sight words, or 
work on vocabulary as it relates to basic skills (sorting and categorizing) For example, they might sort pictures of living room vs. 
kitchen items into two categories, and as they sort each item it’s read aloud to them. 
 
For students who have received ELL instruction for more than 3 years, we provide I-pads and computers to continue reading 
and listening to texts slightly above their level in order to accelerate their exposure to vocabulary, sentence structure, and 
complex ideas. They conduct research not only through written texts, but through videos and podcasts. These resources 
provide access to content area information and research processes, but aren’t limiting for the student still mastering the 
English language. This same technology is made available to ELLs, even as they test proficient in the language.  
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 
At P.S. 172 students are provided with differentiated instruction based on their individual needs as detailed in their IEP or 
intervention plans.  ENL, intervention, and classroom teachers work collaboratively with related service providers to effectively 
plan for each student and to incorporate goals and objectives for the student that are reflective of their disability and their 
needs as English Language Learners. Teachers and services providers meet weekly at specific designated conference times to 
assess and revise, curriculum and schedules to meet the needs of all learners.   
 
Programming for our ELL-SWD’s is always created around a push-in model of instruction, allowing for maximum time spent 
with non-disabled peers.  The IEP’s of our ELL-SWD’s with an integrated co-teaching placement, specifically list subject areas 
for which students are mainstreamed. Placement is determined during the initial or annual review where teachers, 
intervention staff, ENL provider and all other service providers along with the SBST team determine whether the learning 
disability is delaying progress in academic areas as well as language acquisition such that sufficient progress cannot be 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

achieved in a general education setting. If this is the case, students are recommended for an ICT placement so that 
interventions can be carefully individualized and streamlined, and so students with the greatest need can receive small group 
instruction across all key subject areas (reading, writing, math, word study).  
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 
Targeted intervention programs are offered in reading, writing and math.  All   intervention services are provided in English 
and are targeted to address the needs of the learners in each specific group.  For example, a program for beginning students 
usually includes work in vocabulary and letter - sound correspondence and places heavy emphasis on total physical response, 
use of manipulatives and visual and auditory supplements.  Work with Intermediate leveled students use many of the same 
techniques but are focused on developing a more academic vocabulary and word study.  Work with advanced students focuses 
mostly on written English including the development of sophisticated sentence structure and the exploration of a variety of 
genres in reading and writing. 
            Examples of Targeted intervention programs are as follows: 
            ELA:  earobics, lexia (primary and intermediate) Fundations, Wilson, Repeated Reading (for fluency), guided reading 
            Math:  daily, push in small group intervention focused on integrating manipulative, math in the city, envision math, 
Marilyn Burns 
            Content Area:  Content area intervention is conducted as a push in service utilizing ELA skills as a venue for small group 
instruction 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In our Kindergarten all of our ENL’s progressed through the first two stages and tested into the transitioning and expanding 
levels. 15 Kindergarten students tested at the commanding level.  We saw a similar positive trend in all of our grades, such that 
only one student – a newly enrolled fifth grade student just entering the US – testing at the entering level. All other students 
were transitioning or expanding. In the 3rd to 5th grade, our students progressed by the end of the year such that all students 
tested as expanding.  A total of 53 student’s school wide scored at a commanding level. Based on these results, we will focus 
our efforts on supporting as students as they move through transitioning and expanding levels. One significant change in 
program is the increase in student-select, student driven projects integrated across the school year. These projects ask 
students to apply what they’ve learned in a new setting or modality, and the project often include a group or audience 
component, ensuring increased opportunity for building oral language – both academic language and social language- for all 
students. Additionally, we’re re-envisioning our academic afterschool programs to be more subject specific, so that students 
can sign up for the very topic they need the most, and they can become skilled and fluent in that content area over time with 
an expert teacher. Finally, we’ve continued to grow our afterschool enrichment opportunities, and we’ve collaborated with 
CBO’s and our PTA to make these opportunities affordable for all families. As such, students can choose from a myriad of 
extra-curricular activities where they will build new background knowledge and language outside of the traditional academic 
subject areas. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 
No programs for English Language Learners will be discontinued.   
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
English Language Learners at PS 172 are given priority for placement in our intervention, after school and summer 
programs.  Each program supports the work of our learners in ELA and mathematics.   Our school also boasts an after school 
recreation program.  ELL students, not currently placed in an academic after-school program are given priority placement in 
our recreation program.  This placement facilitates our students’ social and emotional acclimation to our school and our 
community.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 
Parents are made aware of school based and after-school programs and school initiatives during PTA meetings and through 
letters sent home.  Spanish translators are provided at every school meeting.  And all letters are translated into 
Spanish.  Parents that speak a language other than Spanish or English are provided with appropriate translation.  Translation 
services are organized by our Parent Coordinator and staffed by parent volunteers. 
 
          Current programs include: 
After school academic – 3 hours weekly (2 days) groups no larger than 10 students.  Intervention in ELA and Math 
After school recreation – 4 hours weekly (2 days) groups of 30 students 
After school Dance -  3 hours weekly (2 days) groups of 10-15 students 
After school chorus – 3 hours weekly (2 days) groups of 20-25 
School Theater Program – seasonal (winter and spring) hours vary 
Saturday school – Academic program focused on literacy and math intervention -grades 3-5 
Latch Key Program – 5 days per week, 3 hours daily.  60 students (k-5) 
Summer school – 5 week program, Monday – Thursday, 3 hours daily - priority given to English Language Learners 
Word Study – mixed grade class, 6-12 weeks (depending on individual need) class is geared toward students requiring addition 
work in phonics and phonemic awareness activities. 
 
            *All programs are geared toward English Language Learners 
 
 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Students at PS 172 are given access to books and magazines in their native language to support each child’s continued 
academic growth. There are 3-7 I-pads, and at 5-7 laptops available in each classroom giving students access to programs and 
material tailored to their specific needs. We implement Fundations, a multi-sensory phonemic awareness program.  Lessons in 
science and social studies are made as “hands-on” as possible and include experiments, school trips and a variety of tactile 
experiences meant to support not only English language learners but also all learners in our classrooms. Technology has 
become a major component of our instruction. Smartboards are in every classroom, grades K-5.  Smartboards enable teachers 
to more easily incorporate visual and auditory cues in their lesson that in turn, more fully support our ELL’s vocabulary and 
concept acquisition.  Our work to support all learners in meeting or exceeding common core standards in really understanding 
complex text has pushed us to create PowerPoint presentation for all complex text read alouds in grades K-5. The slides 
focuses are providing students with a visual/ auditory definition of words/phrases that are critical to understand complex 
text.  Parents are supported during monthly workshops following our PTA meetings.  During these workshops, teachers discuss 
upcoming units of study and explore a variety of ways parents can be supportive of this work at home.  Translators are present 
at every parent workshop, making this work accessible to all of our parents.       
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our ESL program, home language support is provided in a variety of ways. Classroom libraries feature books and magazines 
in Spanish as well as English. Our school also makes use of the International Children’s digital library which provided online 
texts for students in English, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, and more. Upon entry into any class newcomers are assigned a 
group of buddies, which speak the child’s native language. These 2 or 3 “buddies” assist the students with locations, 
requirements, routines, and transitions when necessary.  
 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Services for our English Language Learners are arranged around proficiency level and grade level.  If a great disparity between 
levels of language acquisition occurs between one or more students in a given class, on a given grade level, care is taken to 
reschedule that student to be included in ESL instruction in another grade or with another group (working at a more 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

appropriate level).  Typically, this rescheduling will only be for one 50 minute instructional period, making sure that students 
are working with an ESL instructor during their second period of instructional time which focuses on grade appropriate 
content. 
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
  Not Applicable 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
If time permits, newly enrolled ENL students are introduced to our school well before the school year begins.  Because we have 
a summer program, parents and students receive an invitation by Maria Zito, ELL Teacher.  (in their native language) to 
participate in our academic summer program.  If a student is unable to attend our summer program, they, along with their 
parents are invited to tour our school and their classroom and meet the principal, Mr. Spatola and our parent coordinator, 
Annette Hendrickson. Letters (written in each parent’s native language) with detailed instructions about arrival and dismissal 
times, locations and procedures are mailed home several weeks before the school year begins. Newly enrolled ENL students 
are also invited by our ENL Teachers, Maria Zito and Amy Pimentel to participate in activities throughout the school year. For 
example, our school offers after school groups which include recreation, music, dance, art, classroom after school, and 
Saturday school, which also includes recreation.  
 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

No language electives are offered to English Language Learners.  
 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 P.S.172 does not have any dual language programs.  
 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Because a majority of our student population speak a language other than English (or in addition to English) in their home, we 
consider most of our students English language learners, whether they are entitled to services or not.   As such, professional 
development at our school is not geared toward the development of a professional development plan for ELL 
personnel.  Rather, every teacher is considered a teacher of English Language Learners and as a school our focus for 
professional development is focused around differentiation of instruction.  
 
Differentiation and individualization of instruction have been a school-wide focus for more than 4 years.  Each year our 
professional development plan may focus on a specific curriculum area or a specific teaching strategy but this plan is always 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

viewed through a lens focused on differentiation.   Some topics for differentiation as they specifically refer to ELL’s in all 
curriculum areas include:  building background knowledge, creating opportunities for students to practice using specific 
language and content vocabulary, using visual aids and realia etc. Since we believe all teachers are responsible for ELL learners, 
weekly grade meetings attended by classroom teachers, collaborative teachers, and ENL teachers focus on incorporating 
strategies to support ENL learners. 
 
 Professional development for all teachers at P.S. 172 always incorporates ways to support English Language Learners in all of 
our professional development work. Through outside providers as well as our supervisors and coaching staff, we provide 
school-wide professional development on topics such as:  Stages of Language Acquisition, Effective Vocabulary Instruction, and 
Utilizing Technology to Engage All Learners (Especially ELLs) Across Subject Areas to Meet the Demands of the Common Core. 
These grade-wide presentations take place during weekly grade meetings as well as full-day professional development days, 
enabling teachers to extend and develop curriculum based on their new learning. Furthermore, teachers often create study 
groups related to these presentations, and share their findings with the whole staff at grade meeting. Finally, coaches and 
supervisors develop frequent, focused professional development cycles with individual teachers, and differentiating for Ells is 
often an integral part of these 6-8 week cycles of learning.  
 
The school-wide professional development focuses for professional development are determined each summer before the 
school year, after reviewing student data as well as teacher feedback and administrator observations. Grade-specific 
professional development sessions continue to build on these school-wide topics, and in addition delve into topics unique to 
that grade and student set. Please see the calendar below for the fall’s PD programming:

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
A yearlong professional development focus on differentiation strongly supports our teachers in their ELL training. A key feature 
of PS 172’s staff development program is the 80 minutes weekly congruence meetings across all grades.  These meetings 
ensure that each staff member receives far more than the mandated ELL special education training. The meetings allow for 
collaborative planning and serves to bring together the expertise of supervisors, guidance counselors, special education 
teachers, the school based support team, the ENL teacher, the intervention teacher and grade level teachers on a regular 
basis.  These meeting facilitate a higher frequency of sharing of instructional materials and strategies. Parent coordinators and 
school secretaries are supported through separate staff development offered by the school, the network and the DOE.   
 
 Specific professional development activities include: presentations by outside providers instructing all teachers on the Stages 
of Language Acquisition, presentations by the school’s highly trained speech and language therapists to the entire staff on 
Differentiating Instruction to Support Language Development for Struggling Learners. Grade-level professional development 
provided by coaches and supervisors focused on revising and differentiating lesson plans with ELLs in mind, as well as modeling 
highly differentiated lessons is also offered. Finally, our teachers develop their own curriculum each year in collaboration with 
coaches and supervisors. During this curriculum-writing, an incredible amount of embedded professional development takes 
place as coaches confer with teachers about how best to plan for vocabulary-rich, hands on learning experiences for all 
students, but especially ELLS. 
 
The payroll secretary maintains all professional development agendas, course descriptions, and attendance records.  Proof of 
ELL training requirements are maintained as part of each teacher’s portfolio and as part of their personnel file. 
 
The required hours of 15% total for all teachers and 50% total for ENL teachers are met or exceeded each year, as each 
pedagogue attends an 80 minute professional development session each week, and all sessions are dedicated to effective 
instruction of all learners, especially our ENLs and students with IEPs. 
 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At our school, teachers schedule meetings with parents/guardians in-between each parent teacher conference to share 
student progress and individual goals with parents. Our protocol is as follows: 
Scheduling: Meetings are scheduled for the beginning of November (our conferences are in December), then again in the 
beginning of February before the March PTC, and finally once more in May. Teachers send a letter home explaining the 
purpose of the meeting and an appointment time, and our teachers follow up to schedule over the phone or on Class Dojo, our 
main family communication tool. 
Meeting preparation: Before meetings are held, teachers submit individualized plans to supervisors, and these are reviewed 
and feedback given as needed. 
 
Meeting agenda: At these meetings, teachers give a clear picture of how a student’s language and academic work are 
approaching grade level standards, along with all assessment results. Then, teachers lay out a focused, individualized goal they 
will work on with the student, which includes a school as well as a home component. Tools are shared with parents to help 
with the home component, and teachers explain the relevance of the goal as it relates to the students’ language and academic 
development, and precisely how and when this next necessary goal will be assessed. If a parent needs a translator, our parent 
coordinator helps to arrange this.

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents/Guardians attend workshops throughout the year that are designed to help parents support their children as learners. 
Workshops are held both during the school day and in the evening to accommodate parents’ personal schedules. Community 
agencies, and/or school personnel lead these workshops. A translator works at each of these workshops to support non-
English speaking parents. Some workshop topics are: Nutrition, test-taking strategies, helping your child with homework, lead 
poisoning and asthma.  Our school also boasts a bilingual resource library, as well as monthly curriculum workshops. 
Most effective, however, has been our monthly “Parents as Constructivist Partners”, which is held the last Friday of each 
month. We’ve found the most meaningful and effective way for our parents to learn about what their child needs is for them 
to join their child side-by-side in the classroom, and get involved in the actual work of the day. Grade teams plan these 
mornings carefully, thinking about what content and language parents most need to know in order to extend and support 
their  child’s learning at home. These topics and shared with parents ahead of time through fliers home and class dojo 
announcements, and parents are invited to ask questions or meet with literacy or math coaches after the morning session if 
they have further questions about the work.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jack Spatola, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 172’s written translation and oral interpretation needs are assessed using data that is collected from the 
following sources: the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), which is completed upon a child’s admission to 
a New York City public school; parents’ biographical information provided in students’ cumulative record folders 
and on students’ emergency cards; and feedback offered by parents at Parent Teacher association meetings and 
during parent workshops. ESL teachers and other school faculty analyze this information and determine into 
which languages, school documents, addresses and announcements must be translated.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency, parents will be notified through school Dojo and telephone. Dojo is an app which 
every parent is invited to join at the beginning of the year, and all messages appear over text message and are 
translated into the preferred langauge. The assistant principal and coaches have access to deliver whole-school 
announcements, through Dojo, to parents’ text messaging devices. In addition, the office holds emergency cards for 
all students, and parents are called to notify any urgent information. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Goals of the Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 are shared with each grade team during professional worktime at the 
beginning of the year, and plans for meaningful family involvement and communication are discussed and planned

into the yearly calendar so that parent education and involvement happens on a regular basis across the year. 
Translators (often parent volunteers secured by our Parent Coordinator) are provided for curriculum night, parent 
teacher conference night, monthly Parents as Constructivist Partners, and student cumulative celebrations. In 
addition, directions for the phone translation and interpretation unit services are shared during this professional time, 
and a handout delineating steps for over-the-phone services are provided in the staff resource folder at the beginning 
of each year, and are posted in the coach’s offices next to the phone for easy access.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In addition to the above description of P.S. 172’s commitment to the assessment and identification of our 
student’s parents’ linguistic needs and the strategies we have planned to meet these needs, the school 
further fulfills Section VII of chancellors’ regulations A-663 in the following ways: by making our school a 
welcoming atmosphere for parents who speak languages other than English through the use of multilingual 
signage and public address, by informing parents of their Parental rights and responsibilities, including their 
right to translation and interpretation services, by informing parents of upcoming citywide educational 
events, and by offering information to parents about students’ health, safety and conduct in their native 
language. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Feedback from parents is shared at the monthly School Leadership Team Meeting, as well as through annual 
Parent Surveys conducted each spring. In addition, we invite all of our ENL families to complete a survey to 
provide feedback for us around services provided for students, communication with families, and meaningful 
opportunities for involvement in their child’s learning. Feedback is share with the SLT, as well as the school 
cabinet and then all teachers at grade level meetings.
