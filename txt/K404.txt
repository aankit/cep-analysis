Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The school’s vision was developed with the belief that high school should prepare a student for college and the world 
beyond college by developing the critical thinking skills and the interpersonal skills necessary to function in the 21st 
century.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Academy for Young Writers is a 6-12 college preparatory program. We use writing across all areas of our 
curriculum as a tool for engaging students, deepening understandings, and creating connections with the world. All 
courses are exhibition-driven and project-based. 

We are part of the Urban Advantage middle school science initiative. We utilize Teacher’s College Reading and Writing 
Workshop curriculum in our middle school humanities classrooms. All middle school students take coding courses 
each year, which lead to AP computer science and robotics courses in High School. We partner with the following 
initiatives Algebra for All, Learning Partners and AP for All. Teachers are encouraged to use growth mindset and 
mindfulness practices to support students. 

At Young Writers, we believe in Restorative Justice. When conflict occurs, we focus on ways in which students can 
repair harm and learn valuable life lessons from the incident. We value the power of the relationships students and 
staff members develop through our Advisory program. Staff members are trained in restorative circles through 
Morning side Center for Social Responsibility and we utilize Morning side curriculum in our Advisory classes. 

 

Our core values, Respect, Kindness, Safety, and Empathy are at the heart of the social-emotional work we do with 
students through Advisory, Culturally Responsive Education and the Restorative Justice initiative that permeates 
every aspect of the school community. Young Writers is a community where students are valued, recognized, and 
well-known and Advisory is the nucleus of this work. 

 

Our school has been recognized for empowering student voice to create critical change in our community and in the 
larger world. We have thriving student leadership including Student Council, Black Lives Matter Movement group, and 
our Gender-Sexuality-Alliance was named GLSEN’s GSA of the Year for 2016. Our students participate in the Borough 
Student Action Collaborative and the Student Voice Collaborative. 

We started a small school to emphasize the important role that personal relationships play in academic achievement. 
Our core belief is that when students feel connected to their school community, they achieve at higher rates. 

A few noteworthy programs and partnerships from the prior year: 

Community School 

Academy for Young Writers (as part of the Spring Creek Educational Campus) was selected to become a Community 
School through the recent AIDP grant. We will partner with a CBO (Pathways to Leadership) to develop a 
comprehensive model to address the physical and social-emotional needs of our students and their families.  

Middle School After School Program 

Academy for Young Writers was selected to develop a full campus-wide, five day per week, middle school after school 
program through the Mayor’s DYCD grant. In partnership with Good Shepherd Services, our program addresses issues 
of literacy and engages students through arts, sports and leadership training.  

ESI - NYU Metro Center 

In recognition of our strong outcomes connected to tackling the broad disparities slowing the advancement of Black 
and Latino young men, Young Writers has been a member of the Expanded Success Initiative since 2012-2013. During 
that time, we have continued to innovate and expand our work around these outcomes and have increased

graduation rates, credit accumulation `for our Black and Latino young men while reducing the number of suspensions 
they receive.  

We have engaged in professional development as a school community about the race and power dynamics at play in 
our community and are working to create a community that is reflective of and responsive to the cultures of our 
students, staff, and families.  

AP for ALL 

Academy for Young Writers is part of the NYC Advanced Placement (AP) Expansion Initiative in partnership with NMSI 
and College Board. Through this partnership, Young Writers has received extensive support in expanding our AP 
Course offerings from one course in 2011-2012 (AP Language Composition) to four courses starting in 2013-2014 to 
present (AP Lang/Comp, AP Lit., AP Computer Science and AP US Government).  

EBC Partnership  

Academy for Young Writers has partnered with East Brooklyn Congregations since 2012. EBC is a community 
organizing group committed to improving conditions of education, housing and safety in several East Brooklyn 
communities. EBC has partnered with our families and students throughout the past three years to increase patrols 
near the school, reduce noise pollution from construction and increase MTA public transportation near the school 
campus.  

Institute for Student Achievement Partnership 

ISA has been an integral school partner since 2006 when we opened our school. This year they are supporting our 
Math department in teaching growth mindset and non-cognitive skills to support students in building math 
confidence and abilities. Through its intensive school, leadership, and content coaching, ISA has supported our school 
community in developing our core programs including exhibition-based instruction and Habits of Mind, Advisory, 
college preparatory instruction and guided discipline.  

Underlying the program at Young Writers are the following beliefs:  

● All students can succeed. It is our responsibility to tap into their natural talents and curiosities to engage them and 
to motivate them to become successful in our school community. 

● We’re on a first name basis. In order for members of our school community to develop authentic relationships we 
need to relate as individuals rather than members of a traditional school’s power structure. 

● Students should be empowered to make decisions to direct the course of their education. As we nurture their 
autonomy they will learn to make good decisions and will become more invested in the course of their education. 

● Students will develop a sense of both safety and self-efficacy by belonging to a community that needs and values 
their effort and contribution; which also encourages them to take academic risks without fear of ridicule.  

● Exhibition-based instruction, finding real-life applications to what we’re teaching and authentic opportunities for 
students to demonstrate their learning, helps teachers plan to meet each student’s individual needs and increases the 
likelihood of real understanding. 

● Reading and writing are the foundation for negotiating the outside world as well as sources of pleasure and self-
discovery and are part of every subject and class.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

● When conflicts inevitably arise, students and staff must engage in constructive problem-solving to address and 
repair the damage done to their relationships and the larger school community. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 20% of our student body have IEPS, the vast majority of these students are placed in ICT classrooms. In 
order to meet the needs of this large population of SWD we need to support the SPeD department in effective 
collaborating with Gen Ed teachers to develop healthy ICT partnerships, effective assessment, differentiation, and co-
teaching strategies.  

Additionally, we have a thriving LGBTQ community among our student body. We continue to work to create a safe 
inclusive environment for these students as valued members of our community.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Using restorative practices and beginning to implement culturally responsive pedagogical practices we have improved 
the quality of our school climate and curriculum. We've continued to build a strong supportive environment among 
students and staff. 

Our teacher teams work collaboratively to push student achievement and to support the school environment, but 
continue to have work to do in developing a culture of high expectations and achievement for all students.  

We have engaged more thoughtfully with our community partners and engaged more parents in the school 
community this year than ever before. We are looking forward to building campus-wide parent engagement 
opportunities and to continue to leverage our community schools relationship to increase parent engagement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths – Since 2015 we have increased the number of students who graduated college and career ready, from 6%, 
to 12%, 30%, to approximately 45%. Additionally, over the same span of time we have increased the percentage of 
students who have met grade level proficiency on their MS Math tests from 4% to 10% and on the MS ELA tests from 
11% to 31%. We are closing the achievement gap and improving student academic outcomes.  

 

Needs – Data from the 16-17 school year indicates that only 77% of students who attended Young Writers for middle 
school captured enough credits to remain on track by the end of their 9th grade year. Our College Readiness numbers 
still lag far behind our high graduation rates, and while 95% of our students in last year’s senior cohort took the SATs 
one time, only 55% of the same students took the exams again and took advantage of the opportunity to ‘super-
score.’ 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 50% of the subgroup of students who do not pass core courses at the end of the 3rd quarter will succeed in 
passing these same courses as measured by course pass rates.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In the 2017-18 Quality Review, we were rated Well Developed in both areas- How safe and inclusive is the school 
while supporting social-emotional growth? (1.4) How clearly are high expectations communicated to students and 
staff? (3.4) In our School Learning Survey, 92% of students say that they feel safe in their classes.  

 

Only 55% of students report positively on the Learning Environment survey that peers support one another with 
academic work. With our transition to Mastery Based Grading in our 9th grade, teachers also found a great need for 
students to have time for re-mastery assessments. Teachers found that peer-tutoring based on assessment data was 
effective in supporting students to master content.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, responses on the learning environment survey connected to 'peer support for academic work will 
increase by 11% from June 2018. From 59%-70% as measured by the Learning Environment Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Teachers collaborate frequently in departments and grade teams to support one another in curriculum development 
and classroom pedagogy. On the Learning Environment Survey, 88% of teacher positively reported Cultural Awareness 
and Inclusive Classroom Instruction; and 94% of teachers reported they speak with one another about instruction, 
with 80% of teachers reporting that they desig instruction together.  

 

The priority needs that will be addresses in the goal and action plan for this Framework element are to address two 
data points. The first data point is the Learning Environment Survey. Only 66% of teachers say that their professional 
development experiences this year have included enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas, 
which is 11% less than the city average. Only 69% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively 
with colleagues at their school on professional development which is 16% less than the city and borough average. The 
second data point is the evaluation of the Pedagogy as Proficient and the Area of Focus in last year’s Quality Review 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, we will increase the number of teachers who report that teachers make conscious efforts to coordinate 
their teaching with instruction at other grade levels from 69% to 100% as measured by the learning environment 
survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths –We have a small percentage of very active students who participate in leadership opportunities including 
student council in the HS and MS, student leadership groups including Black Lives Matter, GSA, and the Latinex 
Community and Culture Club. We are a small and dynamic enough community that we have the capacity to create 
opportunities for student leadership and engagement that can impact instructional and social-emotional programs in 
school. In the 2017-2018 school year, student leaders in our high school organized a March for Our Lives walkout for 
the entire school campus and a group of 11th graders staged a silent protest in response to the enforcement of the 
school dress code. We have a very strong commitment to student leadership as a school community.  

 

Needs- As noted above, only a small number of students actively participate in formal student leadership 
opportunities. While the student council is active, the student body is not necessarily aware of their work and their 
ability to communicate with the student body, to hear ideas from their peers, and to engage in making meaningful 
improvements to school is still limited. On the learning environment survey, just 75% of students indicated that 
teachers listen to their ideas and only 65% of students indicated that discipline is applied fairly in school. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
We will increase student leadership and investment in the school community. By June 2019 we will increase the % of 
students who report that teachers listen to their ideas as measured by the learning environment survey from 75% to 
80% and ensure that more than 75% of students report that their voices are heard on an in-house survey student voice 
survey.

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1- We were successful last year when we included email and social media as another way to communicate with a 
majority of our students, parents and families. We hosted academic and social events to engage parents in the life of 
the school community where we had parents and families sign in and give updated email addresses and phone 
numbers. We also regularly have more than 150 families that attend large-scale engagements including talent shows, 
plays, award assemblies, end of year barbeque and community block parties.  

2- Obtain 100% of our parents and families email addresses to increase how we communicate digitally. Participation 
in our regular monthly PTA meetings has stagnated with 10-15 participants on average each month. Numerous 
parents regularly visit the school, offer to volunteer, but is inconsistent with participating in the monthly PTA 
meetings and/or monthly workshops/events. Have a vast majority of our parents and families attend school wide 
events on a regular basis. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
We will meet our families where there are. By June 2019 will establish pathways for digital communication with all 
families by securing 100% of verified email addresses, securing 200 additional followers on Twitter and Instagram 
(@AFYoungWriters) and communicating on a monthly basis about school and community events.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

We will have an increased number of email addresses from our 
families across grades 6-12 beginning in September with direct 
outreach for missing information during the months of October 
and November. We will use a newsletter online platform to 
begin communicating directly with families in September. 

We will plan and host several campus wide events throughout 
the school year (Community Potluck, Exhibition Night, Talent 
Show, School Musical, Family Conferences) where we will have 
to sign in sheet to obtain emails and phone numbers. 

We will develop the Parent Coordinator and the leadership of 
the PTA to specifically target and support the families of the 
students that has chronic attendance and struggles academically. 
Provide training and classes to parents on how to use digital 
communication systems. 

We will plan and facilitate at least three workshops throughout 
the school the practice and plan around effectively 
communicating with our parents and families. We will send our 
PTA leadership to PD's that will help exercise their leadership 
skills. 

We will engage at least 20% of our parents in school day learning 
opportunities such as monthly meetings with administration, 
learning walks, classroom visits, and tech days. We will also allow 
opportunities for parents to become volunteers in order to help 
build strong community ties.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Academy for Young Writers, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Academy for Young Writers will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
 

The CS strategy utilizes the core services to provide a holistic approach to supporting our students in their academic 
success. From the health and wellness perspective, we utilize guidance counselors, social workers and social work 
interns to provide socioemotional support. We additionally utilize a restorative justice approach for additional 
socioemotional support, which is shaped by our restorative justice coordinator. From the family engagement 
perspective, we work closely with the parent coordinator and parent association to create programming and 
resources that meet the needs of our diverse families. Additionally, we utilize newsletters and social media to 
improve our reach beyond traditional communication methods. In terms of expanded learning time, we provide 
SONYC afterschool programming, as well as sports offerings. Additionally, we provide targeted test preparation 
and student leadership opportunities to supplement traditional offerings. In terms of attendance supports, we 
employ an attendance team comprised of different stakeholders which conferences on attendance percentages 
weekly. Additionally, the entire staff work to reinforce our attendance collection methods to ensure accuracy.  

We have room for improvement in all these areas, and we are strategically working to do so in the upcoming year. 
Our methods have yielded successes in their respective areas; however, we will be working to better align our 
efforts to more directly support student academic outcomes. Additionally, we are working to create better 
methods of assessment for our efforts in each core service area.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
In the 18-19 school year, AFYW aims to further embody our role as a community school by improving our overall 
culture, engaging our students and families in socioemotional development, and improving their access to 
necessary resources.  

  We will improve our cumulative student attendance 2% by the end of the 18-19 school year by improving 

on our current intervention and support strategies and ELT offerings. 

  We will expand our socioemotional support to better serve students who are severely chronically absent 

and chronically absent, and decrease these populations 10% by the end of the 18-19 school year 

  We will increase our average attendance at parent engagement opportunities to 20 families by the end of 

the 18-19 school year by improving our outreach methods, and better meeting families’ needs with the 
resources we offer.  

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
 

We intend to improve upon our ELT offerings to better encompass the interests and needs of our students. In doing 
so, we improve the connection our students have to their school. We will be thoroughly case conferencing our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

students who are flagged for their attendance and connecting them to suitable resources and socioemotional 
supports. We will be offering better targeted resources to our families and improving upon our outreach methods. 
In doing so, we improve the connection our families have to the school community. We will also be improving our 
overall socioemotional intervention processes including supports for families as a whole.  

These efforts that support achieving our goals are directly aligned with supporting the academic goals of our 
students. Students and families who feel connected to their school are less likely to dropout or experience chronic 
absenteeism. Additionally, the further students and families progress in their socioemotional development and 
learning, the better equipped they are to address the barriers that hinder the ability to achieve academic goals.

Part 3c. Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following: 
1. 

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

1. The lead CBO in partnership with the community school hired a new community school director in March of 
2018. The community school director has been able to conduct ongoing needs and asset assessments. Additionally, 
this community school director organized the forum where parents were able to address concerns they have 
identified in a discussion format. The information obtained from assessment processes will be utilized to plan sy18-
19 programming in a way that best addresses the needs identified with the assets available.  

2. Students presenting socioemotional challenges are identified through our referral process. They are then 
provided supportive services in a variety of formats. The majority of these formats are offered on-site to alleviate 
time and travel constraints. The referral process will be reevaluated to determine how we will address students 
who may pass under the radar. We currently provide the students we’ve identified with the right services; 
however, we are working to expand who the “right students” are for the support we can either provide or refer out 
to.  

After school services are aligned with instructional programming through the use of a knowledgeable educational 
specialist. We currently offer a healthy spread of after school programming. However, we are working to improve 
our outreach efforts to better inform the school community of our offerings. We will be implementing an 
additional opportunity for ELT through the use of an on-site mentorship program. The program will provide 
learning opportunities that supplement day time instruction. Additionally, this program will help to target students 
who haven’t felt connected to ELT options currently available. Lastly, we will be working to improve the offerings 
we have for high school aged students, as we do not currently have a formal high school level after school program. 
These targeted efforts will help to ensure that there are fulfilling options for all students to take part in. 

 

3. The style of forum which we previously used will be revamped. Data will be continuously collected at parent 
engagement events including our resource fair and parent-teacher conference events. Additionally, a forum will be 
conducted once mid-year, and again at the end of the year. These forums will be incorporated into parent 
association meetings to improve turnout and depth of parent voice. The information obtained from all these 
methods will be relayed directly to principals via the SLT.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

4. The attendance team meets weekly to analyze data and case conference students. The New Visions Data Sorter 
is used to provide useful context information during conferencing. The ATS system is also utilized. We will improve 
upon this practice by providing more case management as opposed to case conferencing of students.  

The community school team will meet monthly and analyze SONYC after school attendance data, information 
provided via the data sorter, and the level of parent engagement measured via communication platforms, and 
attendance tracking.  

 

 
Part 4 – Community School Partnerships Oversight 

Part 4a. Key Staff and Partners 
1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners 

supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.) 

2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to 

engage all stakeholders and be focused on results. 

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the 

appropriate interventions are provided to the right students 

1. The SONYC after school director works for the lead CBO and provides ELT support in the form of after-school 
services. The lead CBO provides mental health support via social workers and interns. The Interborough 
partnership provides additional mental health support to our students and families. Our partnership with the Food 
Bank provides funding for our campus pantry which is utilized by our families. These partnerships provide oversight 
over the services offered and increase offerings as capacity increases.  

2. There is currently no community school team on site. A campus-wide team will be assembled involving the social 
work team supervisor, parent coordinators, PA presidents, SONYC afterschool staff and Interborough site staff. 
Additional members will be added at the start of the school year. This team will meet monthly to discuss progress 
towards our goals. 

3. The school currently uses the data provided via the data sorter and ATS to case conference students flagged for 
attendance. We will be working to better utilize the data provided via the data sorter to better support the 
students we discuss. Additionally, utilizing the cohort of students involved in the mentorship program, we will 
track the progress of the additional support provided to them via the data sorter. We will utilize DYCD systems to 
track attendance in our SONYC after school program. Lastly, we have improved the service used to distribute 
newsletters to our families which will allow us to track our reach. We will be utilizing the van system, and working 
to improve our database of parent contact information to track attendance at community events, workshops, and 
meetings.  

 
Part 4b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to 
implement the Community School program. 
We will need the funding provided by FoodBank to support our school pantry. We will need the AIDP funding 
provided by the United Way to support our staff at Pathways to Leadership and our partnership with Interborough. 

 
Part 4c. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates. 
These efforts will be ongoing throughout the duration of the 2018- 2019 school year.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
A common reading assessment (Performance Series) is administered to all students three times a year. Students in grades 6-8 
are additionally assessed using the TCRWP running record. Students who have been identified as reading significantly below 
grade below grade level are placed into a reading intervention class where they will receive individualized support.     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Time dedicated in class to assessment. All ELA teachers administer common reading assessments. Team time to analyze 
assessment data. Data is analyzed in teams and individually Dedicated IEP teacher and 2 reading support teachers to support 
with assessment and intervention.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

Performance assessment is administered 3 times a year. In addition, Leveled Literacy Intervention and Really Great Reading 
curriculum is used to support reading acquisition for students in pull-out classes. Tiered reading intervention is provided for 
students according to identified reading needs. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Stand-alone reading intervention classes for students in grades 9 & 10. Pull-out reading intervention for students grades 6-8. 
As mentioned above, LLI and RGR interventions are used to support reading acquisition of all struggling readers. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
n/a    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Examining the NYSESLAT data levels, two students in the 6th grade are performing at the Expanding (Advanced) level, while 
one 6th grader performed at the Emerging (Intermediate) level. Our one 7th grade student is performing at the Expanding 
(Advanced) level. Our one 9th grade student is a long-term ELL and who receives Special Education services is performing at 
the Transitional (Intermediate) level. We have one 11th grade student who performed at the Emerging (Beginner) level for the 
third year in a row. This student is SIFE , receives Special Education services, and has an Alternate Assessment accomodation to 
be exempt from the Regents Exams. Since we have such a small population of ELL students (6), it is difficult to identify any 
major patterns.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Grade teams engage in periodic analyzis of reading assessment data. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our students are programmed heterogeneaously in blocks organzied by year-group cohort (e.g. 6th grade, 9th grade, 
10th grade, 11th, grade, 12th, grade). Our ENL teacher services students through a combination of the co-teaching 
model (push-in support in English Language Arts and other content are classes) and through pulling out ENL students 
to work with them in an individual and small group settings. The ENL teacher ensures students are receiving their 
mandated minutes of ENL instruction per week based on their NYSESLAT performance levels. In the integrated model, 
the ENL teacher co-teaches content-specific classes. (e.g. 11th grade ELA). The ENL teacher and ELA teacher have co-
planning time built into their weekly schedules so that ENL support and scaffolds are integrated into the ELA 
curriculum and lesson planning. In the stand alone model, the ENL teacher pulls out ENL students in groups of 1-2 
students during their advisory classes (non-academic) and during math classes for individualized support.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              Instructional minutes are delivered in correspondence to students' NYSESLAT performance levels through a 
combination of co-teaching (push-in) and pull out individualized and small group instruction. Students identified at the 
Entering Level receive 1 unit of study of stand-alone ENL and 1 unit of study of integrated ENL/ELA per week (for a total of 360 
min per week). Students identified at the Emerging Level receive 1 unit of study of stand-alone ENL and 1 unit of study of 
integrated ENL/ELA per week (for a total of 360 min per week). Students identified at the Transitioning Level receive .5 unit of 
study of study of integrated ENL/ELA per week (for a total of 180 min per week). Students identified at the Expanding Level 
receive .5 unit unit of study of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/Math per week (for a total of 180 min per week). Students identified 
at the Commanding Level (for 2 years following) receive .5 unit of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/Math per week (for a total of 180 
min per week).  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Currently we offer push-in support in English Language Arts and other content-area classes, and individualized and 
small group pull-out support for English Langauge Learners as the primary method of support and compliance for CR-Part 154. 
Through the co-teaching model and individualized pull-out support, the ENL teacher is able to target the specific language 
needs to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. Through incorporative of strategies to support language 
acquisition, the ENL teacher can differentiate instruction that uses reading strategies and authentic writing tasks best suited 
for ENL students.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 We are in the process of determining how to appropriately and effectively evaluate students' home language progress.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. For our one SIFE student, he has the extra support of completing assingments with the ESL and/or Special Education 
teacher. Secondly, teachers are explicit in giving him the option to complete a writing task in a flexible setting, specifically the 
quiet space of the ESL student work area. 
b-e. For responses b-e, the following instructional plans are use for ELLs of all proficiency levels, modified based on specific 
student need:  
-Collaborative planning between ESOL and subject area teacher, specifically in ELA, for materials and texts used for classroom 
instruction.  
-Scaffolding is an essential part of the instructional delivery, such as Modeling, Bridging, Schema Building, Contextualization, 
Text Representation and Metacognition.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

-Assisting students during work periods, Conferencing with students in and out of class, informal assessments, and running 
records. -Additional small group AIS sessions for each grade prior to all state assessments, to focus on literacy and academic 
language.  
-Balanced literacy instruction in ELA, ESL, and NLA courses with an emphasis on making active reading strategies (infering, 
questioning, making connections, monitoring for meaning, summarzing, predicting)  explicit.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Explicit, contextually relevant instruction that targets academic vocabulary and holistic academic skill sets. Scaffolding tools 
such as graphic organizers are used to assist ELLs in outlining essays and other writing tasks.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses the ICT and SETSS model of teaching to ensure the both SWDs and ELL-SWDs are scheduled in classes with the 
least restrictive environment. ELL-SWDs are placed in learning groups in their content classes that are heterogenous; mixed 
groups of students without disabilities and non-ELL. The Special Education teacher monitors ELL-SWDs' progress toward 
acheiving their IEP goals.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All of our 6 ELL students are receiving targeted interventions.  Teachers use periodic assessment data to focus in on skills in 
which our students need support.  Most of our ELLs need support in academic reading and writing, and can build on strong 
basic interpersonal communication skills.  Our range of interventions are all offered in English and Spanish and include:  
•               ESL Invidiualized Attention for Essays and Projects during School 
•               Homework Center, Credit Recovery and Regents Review Courses 
•               Saturday SAT courses/Saturday Regents’ Review Courses 
•               Translation and Interpretation Services through our Parent Coordinator and Guidance Counselor  
    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In order to assist our students in both academic achievement and assessment, there are a variety of solutions that we are 
working with this year. They include the following: 
•               Ensure adequate licensed personnel to deliver instruction as stipulated by NCLB and CR Part 154, 
•               Collaboration between content area and ESL teachers to create a learning community which is knowledgeable and 
experienced  in researched based instructional strategies, 
•               Analyze ELLs data, using city assessments, state assessments and our own periodic assessment system,  to become 
well-informed about the performance of each language learner in order to make sound educational decisions, 
•               Provide opportunities for students to be involved in purposeful writing and verbal presentations to practice their 
language skills in an authentic way, 
•               Incorporating all language modalities during the lesson, e.g. group discussions, journals, 
•               Ensure that teachers analyze student’s data to identify strength and weakness  and utilize the findings to drive 
differentiated instruction, 
•               Encourage teachers to participate in professional development opportunities focusing on instructional strategies for 
ELLs; such as, Quality Teaching for English Learners, 
•               Ensure that administration works closely with teachers (ELA and ESL) to support rigorous instruction.   
   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We are not discontinuing any at the present time. :    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

Our staff provide a wide range of after-school actvities and clubs in which ELLs have full access to these academically and 
personal enriching strands of the school community. Some current activities include: Slam Poetry, the GSA, flag football, girls 
and boys basketball, drama, the Talent Show, the school play, the fashon show, robotics, art club, and many more. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All classes have access to 5 Mac computer carts, a fully-stocked computer lab with brand new Mac desktops, and each 
classroom has at least 2 desktops available for student use. In the self-contained ESL class, every student has access to a 
computer. All classrooms are also equipped with fully-functioned SmartBoards   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is provided through personalized attention from the ESL teacher (in Spanish) and from a variety of 
staff members in the building who are fluent in Spanish. We also plan to have "Senior Buddies" (upperclassmen) who are 
fluent in Spanish and Creole who can assist in clarification of assignments, as well as socioemotional support. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All requires support services, including materials and instructional methods, support and correspond appropriately to the ELLs' 
ages and grade levels. We, as a school, strive for high-interest, culturally relevant approaches and content that best suits our 
students, their families, and their personal experiences and prior knowledge.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All classes have access to 5 Mac computer carts, a fully-stocked computer lab with brand new Mac desktops, and each 
classroom has at least 2 desktops available for student use. In the self-contained ESL class, every student has access to a 
computer. All classrooms are also equipped with fully-functioned SmartBoards   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We host an orientation session in which ELLs have an opportunity to meet each other and learn about our Freestanding ESL 
Program.  Additionally, in the first weeks of school we offer an ongoing orientation curriculum in our 9th and 10th grade 
advisory course.  The focus of this curriculum is to teach students about unified rituals, our Exhibitions, to teach students 
about the “Habits of Mind” and also to provide students with opportunities for reflection and positive peer relationships.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  
Spanish is a requiremed elective in 11th grade 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d.

Our ENL teacher participates in all of their English Language Arts Department meetings and workshops . Many of these 
workshops are dedicated to professional development around the Common Core Learning Standards. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school has an advisory program in each grade in which students meet in small groups (10-12) three or four times a week 
with a mentor teacher. The advisory curriculum is focus on cultivating community building and academic skills that students 
need as they transition from elementary to middle and middle to high school. The objective of advisory is to ensure every 
student has a teacher who builds a positive relationship with that student and their family, as well as serving as an advocate 
for that student.   
1.  Our ESOL certified teacher will be engaging in the all staff activities described below as well as district and network ELL 
specific trainings focusing on adminstration of the NYSESLAT, best practices for literacy instruction for ELLs at the secondary 
level, as well as other symposiums and conferences offered through the New York State Teachers of English as a Second 
Language.   
2.  In addition to the above trainings our staff engages in trainings to prepare for the intake process and to prepare for 
orientation sessions before the school year begins.  Additionally most staff members serve as an academic advisor and have a 
role on a grade-level team of advisors.  The 9th grade team meets before the school year begins to create an advisory 
curriculum that ensures a seamless articulation from 8th grade middle schools to our 9th grade experience.  Advisors focus on 
establishing common advisory rituals, methods for explicitly teaching school-wide practices like class Exhibitions, student 
Portfolio presentations, and the Habits of Mind.    Additionally, 9th grade advisories engage in academic advisement, academic

goal setting, and team building exercises and service learning trips.  These structures are in place to ensure that every student 
has an adult advocate in the building, to ensure that parents have a strong relationship with at least one teacher, and to 
develop positive peer relationships amongst our 9th grade cohort.   
3.  Our Professional Development Training for all teachers will focus on the following: 
•               Whole staff works on identifying the different components of differentiated instruction (assessment, materials, 
access to learning styles, etc) and review of lessons and unit plans within this context 
•               Whole staff work on language acquisition and language objectives alongside skill and content objectives across 
subject areas 
•               Technology sessions instruct content area teachers how to use online resources to make instruction more 
comprehensible 
Additionally, the assistant principals, teachers, guidance counselors, ESOL teacher, special education teacher, and parent 
coordinator engages in routine professional development activities which will deepen the skills and awareness gleaned at our 
ELL specific professional development sessions. 
•               Regular (1x a month) department meetings dedicated to peer-critiquing unit plans prepared using Understanding By 
Design unit plans so that they offer entry points to all students and are clearly scaffolded towards final product 
•               Regular (1X a month) meetings dedicated to looking at essential skills in student work from target populations. 
•               Quarterly professional development to support the creation and analysis of data from periodic assessments looking 
at cohort trends and specific subgroup progress.  
•               Differentiated best practice workshops to enhance differentiated instruction and build capacity in general education 
teachers to address the language needs of language learners.   
•               Weekly ‘case conferencing’ meetings in grade teams to identify academic and behavior interventions for individual 
students.   
•               Quarterly ‘learning walks’ that empower pedogogical staff to sharpen their lense for instructional practices and 
teacher moves that foster a differentiated, student-centered classroom.         
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Each student has an academic advisory that meets for 40 minutes four days a week.  Academic advisors are the primary 
connection between the school and parents/gaurdians.  All teachers, assistant princiapal, dean, and guidance counselors serve 
as academic advisors.  Advisors share academic data, make regular phone calls home, and meet with parents for parent-
teacher meetings twice a year.  Additionally, our PTA is active and includes parents of ELLs.  The team meets at least once a 
month around a variety of school related activities and events. Translation services are available at this event.        

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our parent coordinator works with the school leadership team and the PTA to create events and activities that address the 
needs of parents.  Our primary focus has been financial aid, financial literacy, high school graduation requirements, and 
supporting students on the road to college. Translation services are available at this event.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, AAden Stern, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from:

  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Home Language Identification Survey, Orientation Meetings for parents and students, Blue Cards Emergency 
Contact Information, ATS Reports, and Advisory Outreach for all parents via phone calls are used to assess 
language preferences in both written and oral communication. Their language preferences are known by all 
advisors, guidance counselors, and the parent coordinator. Parents are then provided information based on their 
language requirements for our students and families.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
