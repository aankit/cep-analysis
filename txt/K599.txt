Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our Mission Statement: 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At Brooklyn Landmark Elementary School, scholars’ will be empowered to have choice in how they learn and voice in 
what they learn. We will provide innovative, individualized instruction that addresses scholars’ unique learning styles, 
cultivate independent thought, promote the building of character and enable students to contribute their ideas locally 
and globally. The Brooklyn Landmark experience will guide our scholars’ as they develop their sense of identity and 
purpose in this world. We will comprehensively develop citizens who will be decision makers in tomorrow’s society. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The Brooklyn Landmark Elementary School scholars will inspire greatness in others, allow their voices to be heard 
worldwide and create change through their actions and endeavors. By giving our scholars a choice in how they learn 
and a voice in what they learn, we are building the foundation of critical thinkers that is needed in the best colleges 
and in the 21st century workplace.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Brooklyn Landmark Elementary School (BLES) is located in the Ocean Hill section of Brooklyn. The school doors 
opened in September 2013 to over 140 students from culturally diverse backgrounds in Pre-Kindergarten through 
Second Grade.  

Currently we have 392 scholars in 3K-5th grade. There are 63 Students with IEPs and 12 English Language Learners. 
98% of our scholars are Black or Hispanic. 100% of our scholars receive free lunch and are categorized as economically 
disadvantaged. 

During the 2018-2019 school year BLES will partner with one district and two charter schools as part of the District-
Charter Collaborative Program to study innovative math practices . Our goal is to see improvement in teacher practice 
as well as student discourse and performance on formal and informal math assessments. We will continue our 
partnership with Uncommon Charter Schools for professional development and support for our new teachers 
focusing on effective pedagogical practices and Guided Reading. This partnership has had a tremendous impact on 
scholars' reading comprehension across classrooms and grades. The ongoing support and resources provided in 
targeted areas such as Guided Reading and Checks for Understanding have improved teacher practice and most 
importantly, increased student performance. We will continue to send teachers to Showcase Schools to learn and 
turnkey best practices across a field of subjects/topics. 

One of our primary goals is to provide the educational and social skills necessary to prepare students for leadership in 
their communities and success in their personal lives. We partner with different organizations such as Change for Kids, 
Studio in a School, Read NYC, NY Cares, and Third Street Music School to help in the transformation of students’ lives 
through tutoring, counseling, and arts education. Our status as a UFT Community Learning School has made us a hub 
for organizations that serve our scholars, their families, and the community at large.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Students who attend this school live in high-crime, high-poverty areas. Some of them reside in homeless shelters.  

Currently, BLES provides academic supports and services to students in grades 3K through 5th grade, including 
students with disabilities, English Language Learners and students who have been retained. We have one Integrated 
Co-Teaching class on each grade. We have a full time ENL teacher and Speech therapist. BLES also has a part time 
Occupational Therapist. Our rigorous academic programs includes Academic Intervention services provided to our "at-
promise" students 2-3 times per week. Our cluster teachers also provide AIS services for one period per day for 
students. Our teachers use literacy and math programs that have been aligned to the Common Core Standards to 
ensure that our students are not only meeting, but exceeding the standards.  

25% of our scholars are chronically late and/or are in school less than 90% of the required time . The attendance team 
does family outreach and conducts several school wide initiatives to increase attendance for these scholars. For 
example, this year we will have an Early bird CHAMPS program targeting our chronically absent and/or late K-3rd 
graders. We will have a school-wide trip for scholars who have 100% attendance and we have a 100% attendance 
bulletin board on the main floor of the school.  

Brooklyn Landmark Elementary School fosters collaboration and integration of all constituencies to ensure that 
students meet their goals and are successful in school. Because rigorous instruction requires dedicated planning time, 
teachers at BLES receive a double prep one day a week in order to give them the time needed to collaborate and 
review student work. The team is comprised of the principal, assistant principal, coach and teachers. Additionally, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

scheduled intervisitations give teachers an opportunity to observe best practices and plan ways to implement these 
new ideas in their classrooms.  

In order to improve student performance, monthly school-wide trips to cultural centers, museums, zoos, etc. are 
scheduled so that teachers can extend the learning beyond the school walls. BLES will continue to offer after school 
activities providing students with additional learning time and classes in financial literacy, engineering, robotics, 
dance, music etc. 

Although the majority of our scholars have made tremendous gains, some are not at reading or math proficiency. We 
believe it is essential for our school to provide programs and supports that will help to decrease the number of under 
performing students over the next few years. BLES also recognizes that in order to meet the diverse needs of the 
students and families we must provide ongoing services and assistance to the entire family. Our Community Resource 
Director has been instrumental in helping us to obtain services that will meet the needs of every scholar and their 
family members. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Two elements of the Framework in which our school has made the most progress are Strong Family- Community Ties 
and Effective School Leadership. We started a brand new program for parents called Parents & Pancakes. Attendance 
and interest were high. Parents were able to go into their child's classroom to observe what scholars were learning 
and to see how they could replicate this learning at home. Parents had more of a say in the kinds of events that took 
place at the school. For example, we had our first ever Family Fun Fair based on feedback we got from one of the 
parent surveys This year we had more parent volunteers than ever at school wide events such as the End of Year 
Carnival. 

The administrative team made it a priority to provide educational assistants with ongoing opportunities to plan with 
teachers and engage in worthwhile workshops that were relevant to the work that they do each day. Although there 
is still work to be done in this area, great progress has been made. 

Key areas of focus for the school year will continue to be Effective School Leadership focusing on effective strategies 
educational assistants can use that will have a major impact on student learning. We also want to focus on Supportive 
Environments, ensuring that our scholars feel safe and supported throughout the day. A number of scholars continue

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our 18-19 Fountas and Pinnell data indicates that 25% of our students are reading below grade level. These results 
show a slight improvement from the previous school year. Scholars have also made great progress on their opinion, 
persuasive and informative writing tasks. Published pieces and end of unit assessments show that the scholars are 
better able to apply the writing skills they are learning when working independently.  

A priority need that will be addressed in the goal and action plan is increasing the rigor in math instruction. Through a 
focus on math discourse and problem solving, we anticipate that scholars will show marked improvement in fluency 
and reasoning skills.  

In the 17-18 school year, 51% of the 3rd-5th grade scholars who tested, performed at or above grade level on the final 
Math Interim Assessment. 58% of the K-5 scholars who tested, performed at or above grade level on the End of the 
Year Go Math Test.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 70% of scholars will be on or above grade level standards in mathematics as evidenced by End of Chapter 
exams, exemplars, NYS Math Exam and math talks. There will be a 10% increase of SWDs meeting grade level standards 
in mathematics as evidenced by End of Chapter exams, exemplars, NYS Math Exam and math talks.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH).

per week.  

All students 
in grades K-5 

During math instruction, teachers will provide scholars with 
opportunities to collaborate with their peers to solve problems, 
evaluate each others' responses and defend their ideas using 
appropriate math vocabulary. Math instruction will be 
differentiated by the scholars' levels and/or IEP plan. The use of 
homework, partner discourse, a variety of visual strategies, and 
small group work will provide all learners opportunities of 
growth.

State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
The Parent Coordinator, in conjunction with the Family Engagement Team will conduct monthly meetings, including 
topics on math curricula and the NY State Standards. We will deepen our parents' understanding of rigor in math 
instruction and the work we do to strengthen scholars' conceptual understanding and fluency. This will be done as a 
part of our Parents & Pancakes series. Parents and Pancakes is a bimonthly event that engages parents into a variety 
of courses regarding; parenting, GED, and scholar achievement. This will occur as part of our Parents & Pancakes 
series from October 2018 to May 2019.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In June 2018, it was reported that our students, staff and families feel safe and supported as per our most recent PPO 
visits and Learning Environment Survey. According to the NYC Department of Education, the effective leadership score 
on the Learning Environment Survey was a 4.81, the highest among all of the other elements of the framework. By 
September 2018, the majority of our teachers scored Effective or Highly Effective, from the Danielson Framework, in 
component 2D-Managing student behavior. Every teacher's overall score was Effective or Highly Effective by the end 
of the school year. 

 

School data collected from students indicate that a small portion of our scholars do not feel respected by their 
classmates and they do not always feel heard by their teachers and other adults in the school. Staff at Brooklyn 
Landmark are invested in educating the whole child, academically, socially, and emotionally, and have put in place 
measures to ensure that all scholars are having their needs met in all areas. For example, scholars are given an 
opportunity to make their voices heard through surveys and one on one goal setting meetings with the teacher. 
The priority need that will be addressed in this action plan for this Framework is reducing the number of behavioral 
incidences that occur outside of the classroom. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
To revise current systems and structures around behavioral expectations when students are outside of the classroom 
setting. 

-By February we will see a 50% decrease in behavioral incidences outside of the classroom. By June 2019, we will see 
an 80% decrease in overall behavioral incidences with students who are outside of the classroom, in large group 
settings.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

One strength in this area is that teachers at Brooklyn Landmark are consistently engaged in collaborative activities 
which have a direct impact on student performance. This is evidenced by the equanimity of data across classes on a 
grade or within grade bands. As indicated by the 2017 School Performance Dashboard, the New York State test scores 
for Grades 3-5 were: 57% at Levels 3 and 4 for ELA and 59% at Levels 3 and 4 for Math. Teachers are provided with at 
least 2 common preparation periods per week to meet and plan collaboratively. As a school, we believe that even 
more time is needed for this type of collaborative planning. Through Professional Learning Communities and Scholar 
Study Teams, we can better address the needs of students that may not demonstrate the academic growth 
expectations that have been established. This includes Students with Disabilities, English Language Learners, Gifted 
Students, and students in temporary housing.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
The Parent Coordinator, Parent-Teacher Association, the Parent Engagement Committee, and the Administrative 
Team will work together to conduct meetings and workshops to support families understanding of collaborative 
teachers and strategies to promote parent - teacher collaborations. These 3 - 5 workshops will be conducted as a part 
of the Parents & Pancakes series from October 2018-May 2019, during the school day.  

During each workshop, members of the school community and partnering organizations will collaborate to bring 
families together for breakfast( Hence the name Parents and Pancakes), give them time to learn about topics they 
selected on a survey, and provide resources in and out of the school building. Families get to see first hand how 
members of our school community collaborate to make these events possible.Families will also be able to visit their 
child's classroom and see how children, staff, and teachers collaborate to bring forth a positive learning experience. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          20 

 

In addition,a different member of a child's family will be CORDIALLY invited to each workshop, but a parent is always 
welcome to attend. This allows for parents who cannot come to every workshop, to collaborate with other members 
of their family, to support their student(s).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

According to the 2017 School Performance Dashboard, which used data from the NYC school survey, rigorous 
instruction is our biggest area of growth at 3.87. This data indicates the need to maximize our human resources by 
training educational assistants to support instruction in the classroom. As members of the instructional team, 
educational assistants have the potential to play a critical role in the academic development of our scholars. 
Therefore, one area of improvement for school leaders is to provide more professional support to educational 
assistants.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
 

By June 2019, 100% of educational assistants will be able to use effective instructional strategies when working with 
individual students and small groups including modeling, think-alouds and giving effective feedback, as measured by the 
Ed Assistant Instructional Strategies Checklist.

As per data from the 2017-2018, PPO and Learning Environment Survey, our school effectively supports a partnership 
among parents, effective school leadership and the community as a whole. Most parent responses are at 93% or 
higher. The scores range from 1.00-4.99 and all of our scores relating to school leadership and communities’ ties 
ranked higher than 4.00. 

 

We have done a lot of work to increase parent engagement at school-wide events, however it is our goal to help our 
parents help their children. At each parent engagement event a survey is given to collect parent feedback and 
reflections. According to reflection/feedback forms given to parents at Parents & Pancakes, parents are still looking 
for strategies to help their children at home. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

Our 2018-2019 school goal for building strong family and community ties is to increase the capacity of families to better 
support students in preparation for career and college readiness. By June 2019, Brooklyn Landmark Elementary will 
conduct a minimum of four workshops, parents and pancakes, to improve student outcomes. The workshops, Parents 
and Pancakes, are our Families as learning partners program which creates strong community ties and improves student 
outcomes.  

To ensure that the parent engagement workshops are supporting student learning and building community ties, we will 
track attendance at every workshop. In addition, we will provide families with a survey at the end of each workshop. 
The surveys will be compared after each workshop to ensure that parents feel supported in preparing their scholars for 
college and career readiness. Comparative beginning and end of school survey results will report how successfully needs 
were met. By February we will conduct at least 2 workshops to increase families understanding of CCLS and CIE. By June 
2019, 80% of parents, on each grade level, will attend at least one parent engagement workshop to increase families 
understanding of CCLS and CIE.

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Our goal for building a community hub will be achieved through 
the development of local partners and organizations. These 
partnerships include Power my Learning, Change for Kids, Third 
Street Music School and Reading Partners. These partnerships 
will offer workshops, trainings, resources and/or programming 
for scholars, parents and teachers. Our goal is for them to assist 
with empowering and informing parents, improving 
academic/social-emotional goals for scholars and working with 
teachers to identify and address learning gaps.  

The parent coordinator in conjunction with administrators, 
teachers, and other school staff will help ensure a coordinated 
system and structure for implementing our goal. This network of 
involved leadership will help create a schedule of educational 
workshops and parent engagement activities across the school-
year. The Parent University planning team will ensure parent 
workshops are well prepared for and successfully executed. 
Additional support will be provided by community partnerships 
developed with UFT's Community Learning Schools, Change for 
Kids, and the Bubble Foundation, as well as support from our 
school-based wellness committee and PTA leadership. We also 
have arts partners Third Street Music School and Studio in the

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
To attract Highly Qualified teachers we ask our current teachers for referrals, post staff vacancies to our school 
website and forward them to colleagues who know our school mission and understand our school community. Much 
of our staff have come highly recommended by colleagues or they’ve been hired after rigorous recruitment efforts. 
Staff members attend Citywide hiring fairs and they carefully review the resumes of promising candidates. We host 
informal meet and greet events at the school. After the hiring committee makes a determination about which 
candidates will return to do a demo lesson, a formal interview is conducted and a position is offered. 

We provide new teachers and staff members with mentoring through a formal mentoring program and an in-house 
buddy teacher support system. Our staff members are assigned based on their instructional strengths, past 
performance and by being in alignment with our schools mission and vision. We will retain our teachers by providing 
continuous professional development, opportunities for growth and collaboration with peers. For example, teachers 
will have at least two common planning periods to meet and plan with their colleagues each week. In addition, 
teachers have one period to meet in teacher teams to review student data, norm instructional practices, research 
best practices and plan next steps. We will conduct ongoing cycles of observation and feedback and provide teachers 
with opportunities to participate in intervisitations and learn from their colleagues and other professionals during 
Monday PDs. .We will continue to nurture and cultivate our culture of support and high expectations in order to 
ensure that staff is highly qualified. 

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our Professional Development committee is comprised of Administrators, Model teachers and teacher leaders. After 
a thorough needs assessment, the team comprises a plan for professional development opportunities for staff based 
on CEP goals, individualized class goals and professional goals. This plan includes time for teachers to engage in 
inquiry work designed to improve teacher practice and increase the percentage of students meeting the Common 
Core Learning Standards. It also includes specific workshops for educational assistants.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 

Teachers have opportunities to engage in Professional Learning Communities or Passion Projects in order to learn 
how to better support scholars in meeting the Common Core State Standards. They study topics of interest/need in 
small groups for 6 week cycles to conduct action research. Afterwards they share out their key learnings with the 
entire staff. Within the PD plan, teachers also have time to plan effective lessons that will allow them to put their 
learning into practice.  

Paraprofessionals will receive PD and training from a variety of school based staff including administrators, IEP 
teachers and the guidance counselor/social worker. These PDs and trainings will give the paras an opportunity to 
practice what they are learning, discuss how they will implement their new learning and receive instructional support. 
The PD is relevant to the work that they do as 1:1 crisis paras and teaching assistants. 

This year we are excited to be a District Charter Collaborative School. Our hope is that the work we do with the other 
3 schools in our cohort will have a great impact on student performance in mathematics. The DCC team will turnkey 
new learnings with the staff, model best practices and open up their classroom doors as a labsite for other teachers to 
learn from them. 

The professional development opportunities provided by the borough support centers, district staff etc. for 
Administrators, teachers and ed. assistants throughout the year will further help us to meet our goals. . We will also 
continue to work with Uncommon Schools next year for professional development and support around Guided 
Reading, Assessment etc.

intervention services, etc.). 
To help preschool children transition to elementary school we have lateral planning meetings with Pre-Kindergarten 
and Kindergarten teachers as well as joint PDs. In team meetings, teachers share the academic expectations for 
Kindergarten, share instructional practices, and pair up in teams for professional development meetings. We also host

open house sessions for our current families entering Kindergarten. As part of our Parents & Pancakes series we will 
include a session that gives information on how to support children who are transitioning into kindergarten.  

Pre-School paraprofessionals and other support staff will be provided with ongoing professional development that 
helps them to better understand the needs of Pre-K scholars as they transition to Kindergarten. This will be done in 
part through the Office of Early Childhood Education and Brooklyn Landmark instructional school based support staff. 
Topics will include early intervention and early childhood instruction. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
During weekly teacher team meetings, teachers are given an opportunity to review and provide feedback on multiple 
assessment measures. They are an integral part of the decision-making process regarding the use and selection of 
appropriate assessment measures. During these weekly meetings we discuss our current assessments and student 
outcomes and revise the assessments as appropriate. We use the May/June meetings to plan our assessment cycles 
for the upcoming school year. The Instructional Team will meet monthly to review our assessment measures and 
determine if they need to be updated/revised. On an ongong basis, the data specialist will sit in on Teacher Teams 
and conduct PDs to review school-wide assessment data and discuss how teachers can use this data to inform their 
practice.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) Template  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Brooklyn Landmark Elementary School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Brooklyn Landmark Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Parental Involvement and School Quality 
To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review

School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

Brooklyn Landmark Elementary School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and 
programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will 
share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be 
developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Currently, P.S. 599 uses Fountas and Pinnell,  Quick Writes, and performance based assessments.  The results of this data 
indicate the need to focus on writing and reading comprehension.  Classroom teachers, in conjunction with the ESL teacher 
and a Push In teacher during Literacy Block, use this data to create small groups and differentiate instruction that will meet the 
needs of our ELLs in their development of the conventions of the English language and metalinguistic skills. For our ELLS, we 
have noticed that though some may be fluent in their native language, when assessed while reading a book in English, they are 
mostly on beginning levels in English. Each teacher with ELLS partners up ELLS with a native speaker or someone who might 
speak their language. The ELLS are also part of their own guided reading group. If they are not on at least an A level in Fountas 
and Pinnell, then the student is suppoer with numerous pre reading activities to support the reader.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 Our LAP team and Core Inquiry team members meet formally and informally at least monthly and work collaboratively with 
the Principal to review our ELL student data and annually evaluate students’ progress. ATS provides a list of students that are 
eligible to take NYSESLAT for the current school year. Student performance and assessment results (from Preparing for the 
NYSESLAT Interim Assessments, READY Interim Assessments, school-wide common performance assessments and teacher 
made exams) are monitored to determine if students are progressing toward benchmark goals. If little to no progress is being 
made, a new plan of action is devised.     The administrative team routinely analyzes ELLs' student data and the team has 
ongoing conversations with teachers and ESL providers. The teachers have weekly planning sessions, they meet with ESL 
instruction providers and also talk about student progress in all subject areas. They develop and implement instructional 
strategies that specifically address the needs of our ELLs.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  Progress is monitored to ensure that instruction is modified to meet the specific needs of ELLs.  Running records are used to 
assess ELLs. Instruction is then provided based on the student's level. We administer these running records 5x per 
year.  We  use this data to give intervention services depending on whether ELLs fall within Tier 1, 2, or 3. 
Progress is monitored to ensure that instruction is modified to meet the specific needs of ELLs.  Assessments are further used 
to monitor the effectiveness of supports and determine if the ELL is making expected gains. The data is also used to target 
specific needs for intervention. ELLS are placed in one classroom on each grade to keep them together. They are placed in a 
Bilinigual licensed teacher's class or are placed in an ICT classroom where 2 teachers support ELLS and SWD.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 The data indicates that the writing scores and reading comprehension were low across all of of our ELLs. This is a school wide 
issue, as such it is a school wide concern still. Also, analysis of data patterns revealed that the strategies we are using are 
positiviely impacting our students' language development. Two ESL students out of 7 were tested out of the program  this 
school year, 3 of them advanced their level. 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 a. All ELL students on a grade are clustered by placing them in the same heterogenous class to the greatest extent 
possible, where the ESL teacher pushes in or pulls them out to service them. In those cases where students are unable 
to be clustered in the same class, as is the case with our Students With Disabilities who are also ELLs, those students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

who are in other classes travel with the ESL teacher to the classroom of the other students on the grade, who are 
already clustered together, so that they can receive instruction together or they are serviced via the pull out model. 
Our program is designed to make it easier to provide the mandated service hours to all eligible students and to ensure 
that our students get the maximum support available to them at one time. It was also created to create a sense of 
fellowship and comradery amongst our ELL students, as well as to enable our administration to support and track the 
progress of our ELLs to the greatest extent possible. When the students were spread out in different classes across 
the grade, as they were in the past, it was not easy to track and support them, or to support their teachers. Now the 
amount of pervasive on-going support that is needed by classroom teachers is much less.   
b. All of our classes are grouped heterogenously. Students in grades 3 and 4 receive  science from content specialty 
teachers.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Our ELL students receive push-in ESL instruction via a collaborative approach to teaching and learning 100% of the time, 
so that our ELLs do not miss classroom instruction, but instead receive the support of the ESL teacher in their homerooms, that 
are heterogeneously grouped, where the teacher is more familiar with their instructional needs. The allotted amount of push 
in each class varies according to the program mandates for our students. Students who scored at an entering  or an expendimg 
level on the NYSESLAT receive a minimum of 360 minutes of ESL block instruction, while those who scored at an advanced 
level only require 180 minutes of ESL block instruction to ensure that they have the greatest opportunity for contiguous 
learning that is provided by two teachers possible. However, if there a combination of entering and  emerging students 
clustered in one class, then they all benefit from receiving 360 minutes of ESL push in support/instruction. Support for our 
ELL’s also includes interactive approaches to instruction that more deeply engage the students in the four language modalities, 
in addition to strategies, such as accountable talk, computerized instruction, and the use of manipulatives to support their 
learning.  
a. Explicit English as a Second Language is provided in our programs. Instruction includes literature-based and content-based 
instruction alignment explicitly to the NYS standards in ESL, CCLS in ELA, and NLA and all content areas. Instruction complies 
with mandated CR Part 154 regulations      
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    Content area instruction is delivered using the Sheltered Content Instruction Approach as a means to providing instruction 
that is rigorous and relevant. Instruction is designed to focus on how students think in order to foster critical thinking and 
language development.  Strategies are consistent with the ELLs language proficiency in order to have ELLs engage in learning 
tasks that require complex thinking. This approach allows our ELLs to engage in accountable talk, increase their level of 
participation, develop their cognitive academic language proficiency, and build linguistic competence as a means to bridging 
the gap between conversational and academic language. Scaffolding techniques, such as modeling, bridging, contextualization, 
schema building, text representation, front loading vocabulary, embedding academic language, and the development of ELLs' 
metacognitive ability, are used as a bridge for language and content learning to achieve the Common Core Learning 
Standards.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

   The Spanish LAB-R exam is given to students that score at or below cut scores on the NYSITELL. Spanish LAB-R results help in 
the determination of language dominance for planning in providing bilingual and ESL services. Additionally, if a student 
expresses a need and a desire to be tested in their native language on any exam other than an ELA exam, whenever possible, 
the exam is administered in their native language. Many of our programs offer this option and it is utilized when there is a 
need. Also, when there is a need or a student expresses the desire, translators are provided for state exams with the exception 
of the ELA exam. Our ELL students also have access to an array of books in their NL and English as a part of all classroom 
libraries.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

ESL and classroom teachers utilize curriculum supports and strategies included in our core programs are used to differentiate 
instruction to our ELLs. Additional programs have also been purchased to supplement our core curriculum in an advanced 
effort to meet their needs.  Supplemental programs such as Imagine Learning, Wilson Reading, and Cornerstone Learning aid 
in differentiating instruction for our ELLs. Additionally, learning and interest inventories are administered to these students 
and are incorporated into planning lessons that meet the needs of these learners.  
a. We do not currently have any SIFE students.  However, if we did have any, our plan for these students would be to provide a 
differentiated program that would develop their core academic language and literacy skills both English and the native 
language. Students would also practice English skills through the use of Imagine Learning English Technology reading program 
and trade books written in the native language of our students. The Imagine Learning program uses an ESL approach to 
learning. It can be used for whole class lessons, and for differentiated instruction. The goal of the program is to expose all ELL 
students including SIFE to strategies that accelerate their academic growth. Imagine Learning features school readiness, high 
frequency words, listening and speaking, phonemic awareness, emergent literacy, reading and writing, literary response and 
analysis. Automated reports detail student progress for teacher grouping and parent information can be translated into first 
language. Additionally, SIFE students are closely monitored in our school’s intervention academic programs such as extended 
day, after-school, and Saturday Academy. The program uses standard base instruction, NLA support, and interactive 
approaches such as library, and study groups.  
b. Our plan for Newcomers receiving services for (less than 3 years) is mainly to cluster all ELL students on the same grade in 
the same learning environment.  We then assign another classmate, whenever possible, who speaks their native language to 
assist in the transition process and with translation needs. In doing so, the students who are new to the country develop basic 
skills and the necessary language to cope with daily social and academic demands. Interim ELA test practice and test 
sophistication activities are also used to prepare students to meet CCLS standards. If possible, we would also like to have an 
after school program dedicated specifically to ELLS. Currently ALL programs are open to ALL ELLs. 
e. Former ELLs continue to receive instructional supports and academic intervention services until they no longer demonstrate 
a need that the services are required.       
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ESL and classroom teachers utilize curriculum supports and strategies included in our core programs are used to differentiate 
instruction to our ELLs. Additional programs have also been purchased to supplement our core curriculum in an advanced 
effort to meet their needs. Supplemental programs such as Imagine Learning and Wilson Reading aid in differentiating 
instruction to our ELLs. Additionally, learning and interest inventories are administered to these students and are incorporated 
into planning lessons that meet the needs of these learners.      
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

Every attempt is made to ensure that all of our students are educated in the least restrictive environment. Assessments are 
administered and progress is monitored to determine if current placements, instructional materials and plans of actions are 
successful in meeting the needs of the learners. If little to no progress is being made, the LAP team and SIT meet to discuss an 
alternative plan of action.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 All RTI services are offered in English. Through Leveled Literacy Intervention, ELLs will be in groups of about 4 students, 
2x/week, for about 6 to 8 weeks to work on specific literacy skills. Based on their progress, or not, we will determine further 
intervention.   
We also have 50  minute blocks Tuesday-Thursday of extended day services, which is mandatory for all ELLs.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year we have a focus on integrating technology into our curriculum to heighten student engagement and allow ELLs 
multiple entry points. The use of interactive Smartboards, laptops, SMART Response systems, document cameras and software 
programs will allow classroom teachers and the ESL teachers to provide rigorous, engaging and targeted instruction to improve 
student performance. Also the professional development that our teachers will receive should aid in improving practices 
designed to meet the needs of these students. We are also considering after school programs and technology based programs 
such as Imagine Learning and World Book On-Line .  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not have a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ELL students are afforded equal access to any and all programs offered at our school. These programs include all extra 
curricula activities, After School Academic Program, and Saturday Academy. Permission slips are distributed to all of our 
students at the same time. When needed, permission slips for all programs are translated in the native language that the 
parents speak and they are asked to send them back whether permission is granted or not. When ELLs participate in any 
program, the teachers and club facilitators are made aware of who the ELL students are and are encouraged to employ 
strategies learned at various workshops to allow ELLs full access to the programs. Teachers/facilitators are encouraged to seek 
the assistance of administrators if they have difficulty meeting the needs of these students.      
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
  
All teachers of ELLs are encouraged to have a cognates and or picture word-wall. Teachers use the ELL Language support and 
auditory small group lessons from the Go Math program. 
All classrooms are equipped with Smartboards, laptops, desktops. They are creatively used in lessons to further develop and 
enhance Literacy and Math skills.   Teachers also have Ipads which can be use APPs that assist with English language activities. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

   Native Language support is provided through our multicultural lending library which includes books in Arabic and Spanish. 
Classroom teachers are provided translated glossaries from the DOE website.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 Our ELLs range in age from 5 to 8. Developmentally, they need much picture support and multiple exposure and repitition. As 
ELLs, they also require social emotional support. They may be shy or reluctant to speak a language they do not know. Teachers 
can make language more accessible by partnering up ELLs with a buddy and providing books in their native language as 
well.  Technology can also add to their understanding in ways spoken language is still not accessible to them yet.  
The Common Core Learning Standards call for children of all ages to be able to speak and write about a topic.  Children at 
these ages may feel more comfortable speaking to a partner than to an entire class.  Intervention groups give ELLs a smaller

group setting and strategies that they can try out there and then in their classrooms. 
The ESL teacher does have books in the native languages represented in our school. Classrooms also have picture dictionaries 
to further support ELLs.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
  
All teachers of ELLs are encouraged to have a cognates and or picture word-wall. Teachers use the ELL Language support and 
auditory small group lessons from the Go Math program. 
All classrooms are equipped with Smartboards, laptops, desktops. They are creatively used in lessons to further develop and 
enhance Literacy and Math skills.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
New Student/Parent workshops and orientations are held for every new student and parent. The Parent Coordinator works 
with the registrar and the principal to identify newly enrolled ELLs so that the orientation can be scheduled. During the 
orientation, the principal, ESL teacher and Parent Coordinator meet with the parent and the student to get a clear sense of 
who they are, find out what their needs are and to acclimate them to the school community. When applicable new students 
are paired with a language buddy in their class or someone who is relatively close in age.      
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

English Only.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Meeting the needs of our ELL students and improving their academic performance remains a priority this school year.  As a 
result, the ESL teacher, any teacher with ELL students in their class, our parent coordinator and administrators will receive on-
going professional development throughout the year on various topics related to educating, supporting and meeting the needs 
of this subgroup and their parents. Professional development will be provided in our school, as well as any additional 
consultants whose workshops have demonstrated proven effectiveness. The administrative staff will continuously seek out 
consultants who can provide the professional development. These workshops satisfy the 7.5 hours of ELL training (10 hours for 
special education teachers). Agendas and attendance sheets are maintained by the teachers and administrators.       
*Meeting and Supporting the Needs of ELL -   
Rationale: Teachers who service ELL students must understand the needs and learn strategies that will allow them to meet and 
support the instructional needs of this subgroup and their parents. Teachers will learn practices and strategies that will 
maximize learning for ELL students.  
*Common Core and ELL Students - 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

Rationale: With the rigorous demands of the Common Core Learning Standards, teachers must be well-versed in practices and 
strategies that *Differentiated Instruction -  
Rationale: Lessons and assignments must be differentiated to better meet the needs of this subgroup and improve 
achievement. To aid in differentiating instruction and assignments, teachers must be well versed in utilizing all available data 
resources to individualize the instruction. Teachers will learn approaches and strategies that will help them better plan and 
execute differentiated instruction and assignments.     
   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
When that time arrives, our guidance counselor, Janelle Miller, and bilingual translator, Ms.Avila, work closely with ELLs and 
their families to ensure they are informed of middle school expectations and options and aide in their transition.     
Meeting the needs of our ELL students and improving their academic performance remains a priority this school year.  As a 
result, the ESL teacher, any teacher with ELL students in their class, our parent coordinator and administrators will receive on-
going professional development throughout the year on various topics related to educating, supporting and meeting the needs 
of this subgroup and their parents. Professional development will be provided in our school, as well as any additional 
consultants whose workshops have demonstrated proven effectiveness. The administrative staff will continuously seek out 
consultants who can provide the professional development. These workshops satisfy the 7.5 hours of ELL training (10 hours for 
special education teachers). Agendas and attendance sheets are maintained by the teachers and administrators.       
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
New Student/Parent workshops and orientations are held for every new student and parent. The Parent Coordinator works 
with the registrar and the principal to identify newly enrolled Ells so that the orientation can be scheduled. During the 
orientation, the principal, ESL teacher and Parent Coordinator meet with the parent and the student to get a clear sense of 
who they are, find out what their needs are and to acclimate them to the school community. In an effort to be responsive to all 
parents needs through the personal attention and to better understand the needs of our ELL parents and hear their voice, 
parents of ELL students are also invited to a monthly coffee with the principal. The goal is to make these parents feel a part of 
the school community and to give them an opportunity to ask any questions and share concerns with the principal. Various 
information will be shared on the overall performance of this subgroup as well as suggestions for the parents to support their 
child at home.  Additionally, various workshops will be sponsored throughout the year by our parent coordinator, PTA and ESL 
teacher. Parents will be notified of these events via fliers sent home in their native language and our school messenger service. 
Our school partners with CITE to facilitate workshops for our ELL parents throughout the year.  Our staff bilingual 
translator(Spanish), Ms. Avila, is available at these sessions for translation purposes.      

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Participation of ELL parents in activities beyond parent-teacher conferences has been weak in past years.  However, parents of 
ELL students will receive a questionnaire designed to determine their specific needs and interests and sessions on how they 
can best support their English learning students are already scheduled.We also have our very own PARENT UNIVERSITY one a 
month where all parents come to learn about different topics of interest to them, based on surveys.  We have a Back to School 
Barbecue, Parents as Learning Partner Fridays, Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration, Multi Cultural Feast, Character Day 
Parade, HE-ROE Day, Mother's Day Dinner, Father's Day Breakfast, Carnival/Dance Festival, Principal Chats, …  These events are 
open to all parents and invitations are provided

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Robin Williams, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Name: 

Brooklyn Landmark Elementary School  
 

Superintendent:  M. De Govia  

 

 
The principal has designated the following staff member as the primary Language Access Coordinator (LAC) in Galaxy. 
If there is more than one LAC, list all. 
 

First Name

Coordinator? Yes/No  

 

(*Primary) 

 

   

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Brooklyn Landmark uses the Home Language Idenitfication Survey(HLIS) Part III to initially access which are the 
language prefences of the parent community for both written and oral communication. In addition, during intial 
parent meetings, the teachers also assess via interview if another language is preferred with reards to 
communication. The ESL teacher, Ms. Beylis also assesses this need as she begins to talk to parents about their 
choices in terms of instruction for their children. This year Brooklyn Landmark has also gained a Family 
Engagement Coordinator who has developed a survey that inquires which language each family prefers to 
communicate in both written and orally.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English,
