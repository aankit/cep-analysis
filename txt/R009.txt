Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

At PS 9, Naples Street Elementary School, students, staff and families work collaboratively to create meaningful 
opportunities for all members. At the heart of all that we do at PS 9 are our core values: Vision, Opportunity, 
Independence, Collaboration, and Expression, or VOICE. VOICE is reflected in all instructional and social/emotional 
curricula, pedagogical models, and everyday interactions between and among students, staff, and families. It is VOICE 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

that has enabled all members of the PS 9 community to set purposeful goals and work together to achieve them. Our 
core values embody who we are now and will shape us as we grow. 

 

PS 9 is most proud of our work with Framework for Great Schools elements of supportive environment and rigorous 
instruction. PS 9 offers the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Horizons program (8:1:1), which offers intensive 
intervention to students on the Autism Spectrum who are experiencing a moderate degree of challenge with social, 
behavioral, and communication development. The students in these classes participate in the general education 
curriculum and are held to the same expectations as other students, and are making great strides to meet the CCLS. 
As a result of intense common planning, both on grade level and vertically, there is a high level of consistency and 
cohesion reflected in the environment and pedagogy in all classrooms. Best practices from Teachers College, Core 
Collaborative, Metamorphosis Math, and ASD professional development are shared amongst all classrooms. As a 
result, all students, no matter what their designation are engaged in rigorous instruction in a supportive 
environment.  

 

PS 9 is committed to building a strong collaborative community that celebrates the uniqueness and individuality of 
each child. Students learn values of a community including ideals around collaboration, cooperation and respect for 
diversity. Through rigorous instruction, students are independent thinkers and learners, have strong content 
knowledge, think critically, effectively problem-solve, and understand other perspectives and cultures. In order to 
create a supportive environment where all students can succeed, we have established a Child Study Team, composed 
of administration, related service providers, and teachers, which meets twice monthly to discuss students, their 
challenges, and develop response to intervention strategies. Through this structure, teachers and related service 
providers regularly collaborate and communicate about each child’s individual needs and personalized instructional 
strategies as well as their progress in academic, behavioral, and social areas.  

 

It is our belief that parents are invaluable resources and we are committed to offering a variety of opportunities to 
join school teams, plan events and share their voice, beliefs and talents. With various committees in effect, parents 
are utilizing their strengths of grant writing, gardening and the Arts to shape the vision of the school. We have also 
developed community partnerships with the New York City Compost Project, Garden to Cafe, New York Cares and 
Lifestyles for the Disabled; all of whom have helped us expand our school garden program.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 9, a new choice elementary school, opened its doors to the community in the Concord section of Staten Island in 
September 2013. As a choice school we recruit students across the district resulting in a diverse population. With a 
total of 331 students in grades Pre-Kindergarten through Fifth Grade, our demographics consist of 27% Hispanic, 6% 
Asian, 14% Black, 2% Multi-Racial, and 49% White. 27% of students have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and 1% 
receive English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 9 serves students with Autism in both the Nest and Horizon programs. Their specific needs are social and pragmatic 
language, language delays, some behavioral challenges, as well as academic delays. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

PS 9 has made the most progress with effective school leadership and trust in reference to the Framework for Great 
Schools. As a result of effective school leadership, administrators and staff have a close, collaborative relationship 
built on trust. Through the use of reflection forms, walkthroughs, inter-visitations, instructional rounds, impact teams, 
and benchmark conversations scheduled throughout the year, teachers and administrators are able to look at student 
work and other data sources to set goals, develop action plans, evaluate progress and reflect on the school’s needs 
and their own. Administrators use this information to develop professional development plans and purchase staff 
development services and resources to support pedagogy and student achievement. Our partnerships through 
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, Core Collaborative, and Metamorphosis Math allow us to support 
teachers to plan and implement rigorous instruction while meeting the professional development needs of our 
teachers.PS 9’s key area of focus for this school year is to continue to build strong family-community ties by 
continuing to have teachers lead and video afterschool workshops and aligning performance times to classroom 
family days.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 9, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 9 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 9 utilizes Fountas and Pinnell (F & P) assessment system.  This tool provides us with the following qualitative 
data:  letter/sound identification, word recognition, early book handling skills and instructional/independent reading levels.  In 
addition, quantitative data is obtained and reviewed from running records, which is evaluated to determine the type of 
miscues a students in making to make instructional decisions and guide instructinal planning for all students including ELLs.  In 
writing students are assessed through "on demand" writing assessments utilizing rubrics that reflect the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  These rubrics yeild data that allows the teachers to form small groups based on the students' ability, to 
provide differentiated instruction according to the students' individual needs and guide instruction to all students including 
ELLs. This information is also shared with the ENL teacher so that she might focus on key areas of weakness during her small 
group instruction. In conjunction with F & P scores, the ENL teacher carefully examines the measureable scores from the 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT as well as student work samples from reading and writing workshop (i.e. graphic organizers, teacher-
created assessments, student writing samples) to help guide instructional planning for ELLs. Data patterns extrapolated from F 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

& P reveal that deficits in phonemic awareness of beginning ELLs leaves them with far less word attack strategies than their 
English speaking peers as well as comprehension deficits. With this in mind, both the ENL and the classroom teacher 
incorporate strategies to better equip these students to increase performance in accuracy, fluency, and comprehension.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To support this effort, we have Impact Teams (ITs), benchmark conversations, and benchmark assessment data 
collections. ITs are teacher teams that follow various protocols to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching strategies as well as 
support teachers with pedagogy. ITs meet weekly to analyze student work and plan for individual and groups of students to 
provide remediation or enrichment to students based on their needs. In addition, administration meets three times yearly 
(September, January, May) to meet with teachers to analyze data and support them with adjusting instruction to meet the 
needs of individual and groups of students. Administration also collects the aforementioned data during benchmark times of 
year (November, January, March) to analyze strengths, needs and progress to support groupings of students for intervention. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
As we believe that a holistic approach of evaluating our program in order to support students; at PS 9, we are committed to 
excellence and understand that we must grow and change every year to meet the changing needs and challenges of our 
students. With this tenet in mind, all both formal and informal venues are explored including report cards, NYSESLAT, Fountas 
and Pinnell (F&P) Benchmark Assessments, teacher created tests, on demand writing pieces, teacher and parent 
interviews,  and needs based surveys to determine the success of our ELL programs. Fountas and Pinnell provides teachers 
with student performance following information:  letter/sound identification, word recognition, early book handling skills and 
instructional/independent reading levels.  Fountas and Pinnell is administered four times yearly to track progress and assess 
areas of need in to support us with the formation of small groups in the classroom as well as to inform our Tier 2 intervention 
invitations into Great Leaps or Leveled Literacy Intervention. In addition, running records are evaluated in between formal 
benchmarking periods to determine the type of miscues a students in making to make instructional decisions, including 
flexible grouping.  In writing students are assessed through "on demand" writing assessments utilizing rubrics that reflect the 
Common Core Learning Standards.  All of this data allows the teachers to form small groups to provide differentiated 
instruction according to the students' individual needs. As it was our first testing year in 2016-2017, we are now incorporating 
the NYS ELA test as a measure we analyze to look at summative data, adjust curriculum and identify students who need 
support at the start of the school y ear. 
 
In math, we used performance tasks at the beginning and end of the year to identify the baseline and measure progress of our 
ELLs towards specific math standards. In addition, teachers have developed a report card assessment, comprised of questions 
aligned to key priority standards in math (Operations and Algebraic Thinking), that is administered, scored, and analyzed 3x 
yearly to identify trends in students populations, including ELLs, to determine remediation or enrichment opportunities. In 
addition, teachers administer fact fluency challenges bi-weekly on students' independent math levels to determine their 
automaticity with math facts. Students who are below, including ELLs, are put in small groups during mental math time and 
are invited to a Tier 2 intervention program using Great Leaps to support developing fluency in math facts. Lastly, we use the 
New York State Math test to determine proficiency of ELLs to make changes in curriculum as well as identify students who 
need support in the start of the school year.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In order address interventions once the summative data has been gathered, we leverage the work of Impact Teams (ITs) and 
benchmark assessment data collection.  ITs are the ongoing weekly teacher team and benchmark vertical structures that 
analyze data from summative assessments to make adjustments to curricula or small group plans to promote student 
achievement. Benchmark data collection allows administration and the school leadership team (SLT) to look at data on a wider 
scale to adjust intervention plans. 
 
In addition, summative data from Fountas and Pinnell, unit assessments, and report card assessments are analyzed at 
benchmarking times (November, January, March) to measure progress and determine who needs to be invited or exited from 
our Tier 2 programs.

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The school utilizes F & P assessments along with classroom based assessments and formative checklists to identify students in 
need of RTI. In addition, the universal screening process for ELLs (NYSITELL) is also closely examined. Based on need, the school 
implements the Fundations, Great Leaps and Leveled Literacy Intervention programs, and continually chart student progress to 
guide instruction. The progress of these students is checked by interim assessments. 
 
We have a dedicated block of RTI that happens every morning. During this time, trained staff pull students to work in groups 
no larger than 5 for 30 minutes each day. Programs used for RTI include Great Leaps (Phonics and Math), Leveled Literacy 
Intervention, and Orton Gillingham. Staff collects data using assessments specific to the program and spreadsheets to capture 
baseline and progress. During benchmarking time, summative data (F&P, unit assessments, and report card assessments) are 
analyzed by administration to determine if students need to continue, exit, or be invited to the program, at which point 
corresponding letters are sent home to families. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
PS 9 is a new, choice school serving Kindergarten through fourth grade. Since its inception we have tested students with both 
the LAB-R and the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, and more recently, the NYS ELA and Math.  The results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT 
have been entered into the ELL Data Analysis Tool as well as the NYS ELA and Math exams scores, to determine our impact on 
current and former ELL students.  Data from the ELL Data Analysis Tool has revealed that all students including former ELLs can 
improve in the area of Mathematics.  This data is currently being used to evaluate and inform how Math is being taught to the 
students at PS 9 including ELLs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

At each school leadership team (SLT) meeting, we discuss the data from benchmark assessments to support budgetary, hiring, 
and curricular decisions. In addition, we share benchmark assessment data information via the Google drive and faculty 
conferences to get teacher and support staff input on making curricular decisions. All teachers and service providers are 
provided with all data findings.  They use a weekly common prep to analyze and discuss this data and plan instruction 
accordingly.  Curriculum units of study are also designed and implemented several times throughout the academic year in 
which grade teams and administration strategically plan and align the standards to instruction that also targets the students' 
needs. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At PS 9 the ENL program uses an integrated program.  Based on the levels determined by the NYSITELL, the ENL 
teacher is programmed to support the students in their classroom using a push-in model and co-teaching with the 
classroom teacher, for the required number of minutes as determined by the CR Part 154.2.   For ELLs that are at the 
Entering level,  PS 9 implements a freestanding ENL program for the mandated number of 360 minutes in which 180 
minutes are used as integrated instruction and 180 minutes are used for standalone ENL instruction.  For ELLs that are 
at the Emerging level, PS 9 implements a freestanding ENL program for the mandated number of 360 minutes of 
which 270 minutes are used for integrated instruction and 90 minutes are used for standalone ENL instruction.  ELLs 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

that score in the Transitioning level are provided with 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction of which 90 minutes 
are in ELA and 90 minutes may be in ELA or any other content area.  ELLs that score at the Expanding level are 
provided with 180 minutes of integrated ENL instruction of which 180 minutes may be in ELA or in any other content 
area. ELLs that score at the Commanding level are provided with 90 minutes of ENL instruction at the integrated 
model either in ELA or any other content area.  ELLs are heterogeneously grouped within one class when possible to 
ensure consistency in the provision of services. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

PS 9 does not have a TBE program at this time, however, if the number of parents requesting the program increases 
then PS 9 will create a TBE program, according to the CR Part 154.2.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

PS 9 does not have a DL program at this time, however, if the number of parents requesting the program increases 
then PS 9 will create a DL program, according to the CR Part 154.2. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Administration works collaboratively with the ENL teacher to create a program to service the students that meets their 
mandated time requirements.  ENL integrated services occur during all content area instruction.  The schedule is made so that 
the ENL teacher collaborates, co-teaches, and pushes-in during Social Studies, Science, Math for ELLs that are at the Emerging, 
Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding levels, and during ELA for the same ELLs including Entering ELLs.  HLA instruction is 
delivered only for ELLs at the Entering level as needed.  HLA is delivered via technology, or translated when another student 
can assist to do so.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All instruction is provided to students in English. The ENL teacher has access to all of the units of study and supporting 
resources in ELA, Science, Math, and Social Studies via Google drive. All units of study are aligned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards. The ENL teacher previews each unit and daily planner as well as reviews formative assessment data 
collected in conjunction with the classroom teacher in order to provide multiple access points for ELLs via whole, small, and 
individual instruction throughout the school day. The ENL teacher will co-teach or parallel teach using visuals, frontloading, 
and/or task analysis when necessary to meet the needs of the ELLs within the class.  Instructional approaches and methods 
include manipulatives, pictures, diagrams, charts to emphasize and highlight key academic vocabulary for each subject area, as 
well as rehearsal of newly acquired language related to the content.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Currently PS 9 does not have a TBE or Dual Language program, therefore, the students are not receiving periodic assessments 
in their home language. In the case of special education evaluations, we are cognizant that all ELLs referred for an evaluation 
must receive the evaluation in both their home language and English. ELLs are encouraged to participate in all classroom 
exams as their peers, with differentiation, including having the classroom exam translated into the students' home language if 
necessary.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) At this time PS 9 does not have any Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) at the school. Nevertheless, we 
recognize that a student who has experienced gaps in formal schooling may lack the critical (social and academic) skills that 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

are necessary to assist them in performing on grade level. The first step would be to determine if the child was in fact 
a SIFE student. If the student fits the criteria, an informal assessment would be administered to determine the student's level 
of literacy. If the student was deemed to be SIFE, an action plan would be put into effect  to meet the basic needs of the child. 
The next step would be to ascertain the amount of schooling the child has had and determine the child's functioning level. All 
possible support services would be employed (at risk SETSS, Title III Support, 50 minutes of mandated tutoring.) The classroom 
teacher in conjunction with the ENL teacher would review all quantitative and qualitative data collected from 
the SIFE students' informal assessments and observations and will collaborate to create a plan of instruction based on the 
student's specific needs. In the case of SIFE students, research suggests that a differentiated approach coupled with total 
physical response (TPR) and sheltered English methodologies have been successful. The student's progress would be carefully 
monitored and evaluated on a continuous basis.b)  Newcomer ELLs receive differentiation ESL intruction through both the 
integrated and standalone ESL model.  Instruction is differentiated for newcomers in that it may be represented in pictures 
and images, it may be scribed, and it may be translated.  Newcomers may also receive differentiated instruction in setting and 
extended time and in the flexibility of how the newcomer provides responses.d) ELL students receiving service for 4 or more 
years are considered Long Term ELLs and are given an extension of services for standardized tests. For those students, the 
academic interventions focus more on text complexity. Extensive preparation in the writing workshop is also done in the ENL 
setting. In the case of long term ELLs, the Child Study Team would meet with the ELL's classroom teachers and ENL teacher to 
review student work to see if there was an academic issue impeding the student's language acquisition.e) ELLs that have 
passed the NYSESLAT exam are considered former ELLs.  They are provided with 2 additional years of ENL support which can 
be delivered in the form of AIS or 50 minute mandated tutoring services. PS 9 currently services former ELLs for 90 minutes a 
week as an integrated ENL instructional support.  The school's test coordinator is also appraised by the ENL teacher of all 
students eligible for continued testing accommodations.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
PS 9 has a partnership with Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP). As part of the partnership, teachers have 
copies and/or access to all of the TCRWP instructional resources including curricular guides and calendars, anchor charts, 
rubrics, and exemplar student work. In addition, PS 9 utilizes Fundations for students in K-2 and Words Their Way for students 
in third grade. All teachers have access to kits for their own grade which include alphabet cards, curricular guides, assessments, 
and manipulatives to aid in the teaching of phonics and sight words. All of these resources have helped to accelerate English 
language development as our ELLs have made progress throughout the school year towards meeting end-year benchmarks as 
indicated by data collected at the school level through Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessments. Additionally, PS 9 utilizes 
Harcourt Science program, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Social Studies programs to provide content-specific instruction, 
and  Math lessons to help support all students, including ELL-SWDs with differentiation, manipulatives and problem solving 
strategies.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
PS 9 has an 8 period day. The first period of every day is utilized as a Response to Intervention (RTI) block where teachers 
provide targeted instruction to all students inlcuding ELL-SWDs, at, above, or below grade level to ensure students are making 
progress within the least restrictive environment. In addition, the independent work time of the mini lesson allows teachers to 
meet with students individually and in small groups to assess their needs, provide targeted instruction using various 
instructional methods in literacy, and monitor progress. It is during these periods that the ENL teacher pushes in and co-
teaches and works with groups of students within their classroom to support English language development and proficiency 
The ENL teacher is knowledgeable of all IEP goals and BIPs for each ELL-SWDs and works closely with service providers and 
classroom teacher to ensure all IEP goals are attained. The least restrictive classes the ELLs are in are general education classes. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other content areas are offered in English at PS 9. All lessons are 
based on a balanced literacy method, including read aloud, shared reading, reading and writing workshop, as well as the use of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

scaffolding techniques, graphic organizers and pre-teaching of vocabulary. These lessons are offered to all subgroups with 
differentiation for each sub-group. For the math subject area, PS 9 introduces specialized vocabulary, manipulatives and visual 
cues, small group activities integrated with literature and clarified directions are utilized. The Science subject area focuses on 
small cooperative learning groups, integration of non-fiction science genre into the balanced literacy program, hands-on 
approach, and implementation of standards based curriculum in all science lessons. We provide students with more research 
opportunities through technology. The Social Studies subject area provides ELLs with more research opportunities through 
technology, project based lessons, non-fiction social studies genre literacy materials, familiarization with primary source 
documents, and thematic units that correlate with the New York City Scope and Sequence as well as with the classroom 
teacher. All content area subjects are infused via literature that is rich in academic vocabulary and that provide opportunity for 
English language acquisition and are differentiated accordingly for each ELL sub group. All grammar mini lessons are taken 
from the guided reading as well as teacher prepared materials. In addition, we utilized the first period of each day as an 
RTI block where we use Orton-Gillingham, Great Leaps, and Leveled Literacy Intervention to support students who are below 
grade level. All intervention programs at PS 9 are offered in English.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

PS 9 implements an RTI program designed to help the ELLs reach academic proficiency.  Each grade selects the students 
including ELLs that require extra academic intervention. All RTI instruction is delivered during the RTI block and/or ELA. 
Students in RTI receive instruction in guided reading. Each grade concentrates on the students' needs whether it be academic 
vocabulary acquisition, content area support, written responses, English language verbal acquisition. RTI is available for both 
ELLs and monolingual students. It is expected that this will improve student acquisition of subject area vocabulary and 
understanding.     
 
The data used to determine that ELLS need to make growth in academic vocabulary include student performance on reading 
bend assessments, on demand writing assessments, constructed response items on math assessments, and most recently, 
data from the NYS ELA exam. Based on this data, we have updated our professional development program to support students 
with explaining their thinking in mathematics and to plan instruction  to address reading, speaking, and writing with grade level 
appropriate vocabulary across reading for information, literature, based on NYS Learning Standards across reading for 
information and literacture, foundational, speaking and listening, language and writing standards. 
 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

PS 9 does not currently have a bilingual program but will open one if the number of parents requesting the program meets the 
requirement as per the CR Part 154.2. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All programs offered at PS 9 are open to all students regardless of grade, academic level, or English language proficiency. 
Notices sent home introducing any programs at PS 9 are sent home in English. These notices are translated for those parents 
that have indicated that they prefer to have notices sent to them in another language. In this manner, PS 9 has assured that all 
parents or caregivers of its student body are made aware of all programs and events taking place at PS 9 and thereby have 
afforded equal access to all ELLs for all school programs. Programs include after school enrichment and clubs, and are open to 
current and former ELLs.  ELLs that participate in these programs find them academically enhancing.  This program is run by 
certified teachers. 
 
In addition, school leadership meets with the the after school director and club teachers to review student participating in 
school programs and employs the parent coordinator to conduct outreach via phone or email in a family's native language to 
all parents who do not take advantage of school programs.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials used to support ELLs are: Mondo and other multicultural literature, author study books, and non-fiction 
literature such as National Geographic, Time for Kids & Scholastic News and newspapers; technology such as the National 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

Geographic website, audio listening centers including read alouds, read alongs, music, and poetry; Barnes and Nobles 
Storytime Online and Starfall online phonics activities and reading. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

PS 9 exercises the New Language program model schoolwide.  PS 9 teachers know that they are all teachers of ELLs.  As such, 
New Language is incorporated and emphasized into daily instruction across the grades and contents. Opportunities for 
students to use new language are created by the teacher and incorporated into lessons and activities daily.   In addition to 
home language support that students may receive with the ENL teacher, students can have access to glossaries, dictionaries, 
and other instructional materials in their home languages. Teachers use technology such as the Google platform and "apps" in 
order to support home language delivery across all content areas. If needed, teachers group students of the same language for 
certain activities so that they can assist each other and respond in their home language.  Home language may be used in the 
classroom when necessary for self and peer assessment as well as Turn -n-Talk.  Use of technology to suport home language 
delivery across content areas  can extend to after and before school programs, and summer school should the need arise.  PS 9 
does not currently have a DL and a TBE program, but if the numbers grow and we open such programs, the New Language 
support will be assessed and delivered accordingly. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

PS 9 implements an ENL program that corresponds to the ELL's age and grade level as closely as possible. The ELLs are grouped 
in accordance with the English language level that the ELL scored under either from the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT, and within 
two grade bands of the ELL's grade.  This grouping is done to avoid self esteem issues and confidence issues for the ELL as well 
as to support students with making progress within the subject area's progression.  All required services are provided for the 
ELL in an age and grade appropriate setting.  PS 9 provides the ELLs with multi lingual classroom library books that support and 
correspond to the ELLs age and grade level.   Differentiated lessons are prepared that support and correspond to the students 
including ELLs' ages and grade levels and that meet all of the students' needs.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
PS 9 does not currently share the school building with any other school or facility but in the event that we did, we would share 
all resources and coordinate efforts to ensure all the academic, linguistic and socioemotional needs of the ELLs will be met.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In June, parents of newly registered Kindergarten students are invited to PS 9s' Kindergarten Orientation. At this event, newly 
incoming Kindergarten students and their parents are introduced to the Principal and Assistant Principal, the school nurse, 
parent coordinator, teachers, school aides and other school staff. An informational presentation is made by the Principal, 
Parent Coordinator, school nurse, ENL teacher, and PTA President. Family Handbooks are distributed to all who attend and are 
mailed to parents who do not attend. The handbook contains general school information and procedures, goals, checklists, 
supply lists, are translated as needed and available electronically.  Parents are welcomed to the school, provided with 
pertinent information and are afforded the opportunity to ask questions. In August, all families are invited to a get together in 
the PS 9 school yard where they are introduced to their teachers, other school personnel, and future classmates. Many of the 
current and incoming students attend each year.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

ELLs that are at the Zero English Beginner English language levels, are encouraged to communicate in English, but may elect to 
communicate in their home language so long as they support the communication by retelling it or presenting it in another 
genre.  
 
We currently do not offer language electives. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

PS 9 does not currently have a Dual Language program but will open one if the number of parents 
requesting it meets the requirement according to the CR Part 154.2.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
At PS 9 all teachers are teachers of ELLs.  The ENL teacher at PS 9 attends PD offered by the Division of English Language 
Learners and Student Support which aides in preparing lessons plans that support ELLs academic engagement in the Common 
Core Learning Standards. Often times, guest speakers, compliance specialists, and representatives from major educational 
publishing companies are invited to offer teaching insights that help align the ENL program to the Common Core Learning 
Standards. These PDs are then turn-keyed in order to support classroom teachers in techniques and methods in delivering the 
instruction not only to the ELLs in their classrooms, but also to other students who would benefit from the support.   
 
The ENL teacher also attends the grade team meetings of the students whose grade (s)he teaches in order to become familiar 
with the Common Core aligned units of study, strategies to support literacy development, and to share best practices with 
classroom teachers. In addition, the ENL teacher is invited to attend choice workshops offered by teachers and related service 
providers to support him/her with incorporating new ideas in content-related pedagogy. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Professional development is offered to all common branch teachers, subject area / cluster teachers.  It is also provided for all 
support personnel such as lunch staff, school aides, secretaries and service providers such as Speech, Occupational / physical 
Therapists and the school nurse, guidance counselors and school psychologists. paraprofessionals and the parent coordinator 
are also provided with PD.  In all, everyone in the school that directly or indirectly works with an ELL or ELL-SWD is provided 
with professional development so they may know how to communicate and how to understand the way the student 
communicates. All school personnel of PS 9 are made aware at the September PD,  of the differences between Basic 
Interpersonal Communicative Skills (BICS) and Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP). This helps them to better 
understand, and plan better communication as well as assessments for the ELL in their classroom. It also helps them to 
familiarize themselves with the different levels of expectations from the ELL students and how to guide the students to 
perform at the same expectations of their peers.  They are also asked to sit the ELL near the students that are most active in 
the classroom so that the ELL is surrounded by an English language rich environment as much as possible. The ENL teacher 
models for the teachers and paraprofessionals of ELLs how to produce a verbal response from the ELL by using the TPR and 
visual cues methods and techniques. At the November PD (Election Day), all school staff is encouraged to share how the ELLs 
learning style is / may be affected by their cultural norms. Awareness in cultural differences, cultural sensitivity, and 
acceptance is then discussed by the ENL teacher. Teachers and paraprofessionals of PS 9s ELLs are encouraged to 
communicate with the ENL teacher for any assistance they may need relating to the ELL. They are also encouraged to observe 
the ENL teacher in the ENL classroom whenever possible.  PD for the staff also includes at least 15% of PD for non ENL teachers 
each Monday, and up to 50% PD for the ENL teacher as per the CR Part 154.2.   
 
Records of PD include attendance sheets, paper and electronic agendas, and resources distributed in person and through the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

Google drive. These records are maintained by the principal, assistant principal, and school secretary. 
 
Our tentative calendar for ELL PDs include 11/1, 11/8, 11/20, 12/11, 1/3, 1/10, 2/26, 3/12, 4/18, 4/25, 5/14, 5/21, 6/5, 6/6 
 
The ENL teacher will be attending various PDs throughout the school year, as provided by the Division of English Language 
Learners and Student Support as they are announced.  These PDs will include suggestions on improving ELL academic 
achievement in the content areas, the use of instructional strategies for ENL instruction and support, and PDs in Compliance 
and ELL testing.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parental involvement is considered crucial in the acquisition of the English language in the ELL. To foster a relationship 
between the ELLs parents and the school, PS 9 conducts individual meetings with the parents on Tuesdays, where each 
Tuesday will be dedicated to an individual parent.  In this way the parent can voice his / her concerns about how their child is 
learning in school, and how PS 9 can best help reach their child academically.  
Records of individual meetings are kept by the ENL teacher, detailing the parents' concerns and topics discussed. Parents will 
be asked to sign and date a log which will be placed in a folder and maintained by the ENL teacher. Parents that can not attend 
face to face meetings, will be reached via telephone with translators if needed and these conversations will also be logged and 
kept by the ENL teacher.  
 
In addition to above, parents are surveyed to determine the best day and time as well as the topic they would like to learn 
more about in order for administration and teachers to plan and deliver parent workshops. In addition to the mandated parent 
teacher conferences, teachers from each grade and speech therapists offer two additional workshops on literacy and math, 
including strategies taught in class and home support. Translation services are provided should parents need. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents of ELLs are invited to become involved in the ELL's education. To determine the need for workshops, the ENL teacher 
surveys ELL parents during the ELL parent meeting. To promote and facilitate involvement, parental workshops in academic 
and social issues are also offered to parents.  These workshops include information that will help the parent understand the 
schools' homework, trips, lunch and school safety policies, how to assist the ELL with math, reading, and academically 
motivating games and websites.   To foster a relationship between the child and home, implements opportunities that allow 
the parents and the children to feel welcome at PS 9 and part of the PS 9 family which include but are not limited to Mystery 
Reader, Movie night, Family game night, Faculty/Family softball, Pumpkin Smash, and Summer Picnic.  Depending on budget, 
we may continue the Summer Reading program ("Beat the Heat on Targee Street") which can run on a weekly basis. 
 
At the beginning of each year, we survey families who checked off a language other than English on the Home Language 
Survey to determine the need for translation services. We use translation services through the DOE, bilingual staff members 
for face to face meetings and phone calls, and translate documents to be sent home into the home language of the family.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Deanna Marco, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Parents complete a home language survey. An identified staff member speaks to the family personally to 
determine what the spoken language at home is. We indicate this in ATS, mark the child’s cumulative records and 
notify the classroom teacher. The school secretary also keeps a log of the parents' language preference for school 
notice distribution purposes. Families also complete blue cards which allow staff members to communicate in a 
parents preferred language and modality. In addition, informal feedback provides us with appropriate 
information. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Staff members are made aware of this regulation during opening PD sessions and through ongoing PD throughout the 
year including Election Day PD. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school will fulfill the translation requirement by providing each parent whose primary language is a covered 
language and who require language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Rights and Responsibilities which 
includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. The school also posts signs in the main lobby 
stating that translation and interpretation services are available. The school's safety plan contains procedures for 
ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not prevented from reaching the school's administrative 
offices.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Throughout the school year, PS 9 administers parent surveys regarding various school structures in order to obtain 
feedback about the quality and availability of services and communication. In addition, the administration looks 
closely at the parent survey administered in March. Parent feedback is also solicited during SLT and PTA meetings. All 
information gleaned from the aforementioned mechanisms are considered when making changes to programs and 
structures that are used to support students and their families.
