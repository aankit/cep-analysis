Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Margaret Douglas Elementary School (PS 36) is an elementary school on Morningside Drive that currently serves pre-K 
through grade 5. For many years, the school served pre-K to grade 2, but in 2009-10 the school began its expansion by 
adding one upper grade each year and 2011-12 was the first year with students spanning pre-K through 5. We 
envision our school as a multicultural, state-of-the-art elementary school providing world-class excellence through an 
enthusiastic educational environment fostering creativity, critical thinking and problem solving skills. Our mission is to 
provide a safe and nurturing learning community that advances the academic, social, emotional and physical 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

development of all students. The PS 36 community embraces a team-oriented approach that is focused on developing 
the whole child, while inspiring them to become life-long learners to reach their greatest potential in school and life.  

We approach our work from a core valued system centered on the E’s of Excellence: 
· Engage – We believe that inclusive participation from parents, teachers, staff, administration and community 
enhances the educational outcomes for our students. 
· Enrich – We believe in adding value to our students by improving their academic, social and emotional 
competencies. 
· Encourage – We believe all children have the ability to learn and that through support and nurturing, we can help 
them reach their full potential. 
· Empower – We believe that an empowered student will be one who believes in his/herself and demonstrates 
honesty, integrity, nobility and humility in their actions. 
 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 36 consistently seeks to provide students with varied learning experiences and a supportive school community. 
Our theory of action is that If we strengthen the capacity of teachers to effectively analyze data to drive instruction, 
then teachers will be able to design instruction that meets the learning needs of each student so that students are 
provided with instruction that targets specific skills, authentic feedback, and next steps to improve student learning. 
Over the past six years, we have developed a community school approach to learning that includes expanded learning 
opportunities, physical and mental health supports, family engagement, and attendance supports, all paired with high 
quality instruction. We were awarded a three-year Community Schools Grant Initiative from NYSED that has been 
renewed for two additional years - into the 2018-19 school year. Our partner under A.I.D.P. to support this work is 
Teachers College, Columbia University Raising Educational Achievement Coalition of Harlem (REACH). To further 
support our work around the community schools model, we have partnered with Children's Health Fund and Harlem 
Dowling West Side Center (with a grant through DYCD). We work with many other Community Based Organizations 
(CBOs) to further enrich our community including: New York Chess Kids; New York Foundling; Studio in a School; and, 
Counseling in Schools. 
Our after school and expanded learning opportunities (E.LO.) include a variety of activities through Harlem Dowling 
West Side Center and include yoga, arts, and STEM programming. We provide students with Summer In the City 
Programming offered through the NYCDOE. Teachers provide AIS services and next year we will expand this to include 
Reading Rescue for 1st and 2nd graders who are below grade level. 
For physical health opportunities, each year our school organizes a Health Resource Fair for families and students. 
Last year we organized dental and vision screenings with follow-up services for students, and will continue again this 
year. Children's Health Fund plans to continue working with teachers next year to expand the referral program for 
parents that will increase access to wellness services in the community. For mental health, through TC REACH we 
partner with NY Foundling to provide an additional counselor who sees individual students and organizes parent 
support groups. Through Children's Health Fund, we partner with Counseling in Schools for an additional counselor 
who uses art therapy to work with students and parents. On the 2017 School Survey, 89% of parents agreed or 
strongly agreed the school notifies them if there are any emotional or psychological issues affecting student 
achievement. Next year, we hope to expand our use of the Success Highways resiliency assessment to target small 
groups of students for additional groups counseling experiences. To support attendance, Children's Health Fund 
organizes an Attendance Rockets group and the school uses Kinvolved to communicate regularly with parents around 
daily attendance. We also use a social-emotional curriculum and Book of the Month to introduce community values 
such as caring, perseverance, and kindness. Next year we will also be implementing restorative justice practices 
school-wide. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Families participate regularly at a variety of events at our school. The results from last year's School Quality Snapshot 
data indicated that 91% of our parents were satisfied with the communication they received from staff about student 
achievement. 92% of parents agreed they were greeted warmly when visiting the school. 91% of parents felt teachers 
worked closely with them to support their child. This past school year we included a number of parent workshops 
around academic skills, and also referred parents to Parent Job Net to build their own career resumes, for ESL classes, 
and TASC/GED programs. On parent surveys and at the Community School Forum, parents expressed an interest in 
more academic-based workshops to help engage them in support students at home, and we will begin those offerings 
in 2018-19. 
REACH works with our staff providing professional development, and last year helped support them to expand their 
repertoire of literacy and math strategies, and develop teacher leadership capacity to ensure that rigorous instruction 
takes place in the classroom. Additionally, a DOE Literacy Coach provides support to our K-2 teachers to develop their 
ability to understand the instructional expectations and coherent implementations of strategies. In 2015-16, we 
expanded our partnership with Teachers College to provide additional support for implementation of the TC Writing 
Project curriculum. In 2018-19, we will continue these supports for teachers. We will also be introducing Pre-K and 
Kindergarten to the progressive teaching model through Bank Street, taking part in the Algebra for All initiative at 5th 
grade, and introducing the Next Generation ELA and Math standards to all teachers. To prepare our students with 
21st century technology skills and engage the diverse learning styles of our students, our school promotes integration 
of technology in instruction. Each classroom is equipped with Promethian smart board capabilities and at least two or 
more computers available for student use. Mobile laptop stations are moved from classroom to classroom to make 
technology more accessible to students. We use the Accelerated Reading and Accelerated Math online common core 
aligned assessments which help students to keep track of their academic progress in reading and mathematics.  
 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

In 2017-18, there are 386 students enrolled in grades Pre-K through 5. There are 45 Pre-K seats. The school’s current 
racial makeup is 55% Black and 41% Hispanic/Latino. Boys account for 48% and girls account for 52%. The student 
body includes 11% of English Language Learners (ELLs) and most of our ELLs have a primary language of Spanish. The 
school’s students with disabilities (SWD) population is 31%; about one-third of these students are in ICT classes, but 
nearly half of the SWD students are in self-contained settings. The percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-
price lunch is 82% and the school qualifies for Title I funding. As of June 21, 2018, the average attendance rate for the 
school year was 90.2%, and we still struggle with a high chronic absenteeism percentage of 44%. 19% of students are 
in temporary housing.  
 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Based on the NYC DOE School Quality Snapshot for 2017-18, PS 36 scored highest on Rigorous Instruction (3.03) and 
Collaborative Teachers (3.12). These were also the two indicators where we made the greatest gains. There was also 
Improvement under Effective School leadership. In terms of student achievement, the school scored a rating of 3.11, 
which is on track with the district average. In spring 2017, the average student proficiency on NYSED ELA was 2.41 and 
for math was 2.30. Gains were made in ELA (from 18% to 21% at level 3 and 4) while percentages remained the same 
for math at 22%. 
 
Although there has been progress in some areas of the Framework of Great Schools, there are some areas such as 
Supportive Environment (2.40), Strong Family-Community Ties (2.76), and Trust (2.41) where we have additional work 
to do to meet targets. Consequently, in the year ahead, PS36 will continue the process of providing support to 
students, parents and pedagogues to improve overall school environment and relationships in order to strengthen the 
instructional core as well as build a more robust school culture and strong structures for student improvement. 
 
We have seen some movement in the scores for our special populations. On the 2016 state tests, ELL proficiency was 
26.1% within range of our NYC targets on ELA and 26.5% on math. For our students in self-contained settings, 100% of 
students were within the range set by DOE for ELA and math.  
 
The school's outcomes on the NYC DOE metrics as delineated in the School Quality Guide are consistent with its 
outcomes on the NYSED metrics evidenced by the fact that its State Accountability status is Good Standing. While the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

 

school has made some significant gains through its substantive accomplishments there are two major challenges that 
we are working to eliminate as outlined below: 
 
While we had gains in the percentage of students passing the NYS ELA and math assessments, they were not 
significant in the aggregate or for the key subgroups. During the 2018-19 school year there will be a continued and 
concentrated effort focused on looking at student data to pinpoint areas of academic and non-academic need so that 
timely and appropriate student and teacher interventions can be put in place to better maximize opportunities for 
student progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In 2016-17 progress was made on NYSED test outcomes in ELA at 23% (up from 18% in 2016) and remained the same 
at 22% for math. For our math outcomes, in spring 2017, 14% of SWDs were proficient on math (up from 10% in 2016) 
but ELL performance declined from 17% to 0%. For economically disadvantaged students, performance improved 
slightly in math from 20% to 22% in 2017. On ELA, SWD performance remained the same at 5% in both 2016 and 
2017. Economically disadvantaged students improved from 17% to 23% on ELA in 2017. 

 

While we are still awaiting the outcomes for the 2017-18 NYSED test scores, our June 2018 instructional score reports 
indicate we continued to make some gains. For instance, in ELA, third grade improved the percentage of possible 
points on reading from 49% to 51% and on writing from 39% to 42%; in fifth grade, reading improved from 47% to 
58% and writing improved from 41% to 63%. For math, third grade's percentage of possible points on all questions 
improved from 47% to 52% with an overall improvement on the constructed response from 35% to 47%; in fifth 
grade, there was an overall improvement on all questions from 37% to 50% and on constructed response from 22% to 
33%. However, our fourth grade team declined in both reading and math: the percentage of possible points for 
reading declined from 57% to 48% and writing declined from 56% to 39%. For math, the fourth grade also declined 
from 57% to 42% overall, with a decline on constructed response from 51% to 33%. 

 

The 2016-17 data indicated a clear need to reduce the number of Level 1 students and increase the percentage of 
students, in the aggregate as well as for the different subgroups, meeting proficiency levels 3 and 4, and we anticipate 
we will see similar results in 2017-18. In addition, we need to expand and strengthen some of our initiatives to ensure 
gains made in third grade continue in fourth grade. To address this need, the school will work to build on and 
institutionalize several current initiatives that have contributed to the growth between last year and the prior year.  

Specifically, PS 36 will continue to concentrate its efforts and commitment to using data to drive instruction and 
providing pedagogues with meaningful and quality professional development with support from one of its strategic 
partners. Teachers College, Columbia University (TC) provides designated instructional lead teachers with ongoing 
professional development. Their work will support participating teachers in the ongoing processes of assessing, 
analyzing data (i.e. NYSED Data, School-net, Baseline Assessments in ELA and Math and school documents), 
determining school and grade level goals, and the planning and implementation of instruction aligned to Common 
Core Learning Standards. In addition, TC will support the school’s leadership in examining academic and non-academic 
data to routinely review outcomes against goals and the SCEP to identify adjustments that need to be made. In 
addition, for math instruction Grade 5 will participate in the Algebra for All trainings through DOE and a pilot program 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

using Engage NY for third grade will expand to grades 4 and 5. For Math in 4th grade, the school will participate in a 
charter-district collaborative that will focus on the strengthening of pedagogy and content knowledge.  

The school will also turn attention to long-term strategies to ensure that the non-tested grades are preparing 
students for grade level work on future exams. This will include the continuation of literacy supports from our NYC 
DOE Literacy Coach and the introduction of the Reading Rescue Program for 1st and 2nd graders who are behind 
grade level. Pre-K and Kindergarten will begin implementation of a progressive curriculum (modeled on Bank Street's 
curriculum) to support more rigorous work on the early childhood grades. We will also begin a school-wide financial 
literacy program to address math skills. 

Collectively, these initiatives and activities will ensure that teachers across all grade levels have access to the 
professional development that they need to enhance teaching and learning so that students develop their critical 
thinking skills across all disciplines and experience increased outcomes in their performance.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, increase academic achievement/performance outcomes of all students on NYS ELA and Mathematics 
exams by 8-10% as evidenced by the number/percentage of students performing at proficiency levels 3 and 4.

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will identify all students not meeting performance 
standards in ELA and Mathematics (Levels 1 and 2), identify 
target skills, and provide strategic strategies and instruction in 
small and guided groups. In addition, paraprofessionals will 
support students through Great Leaps, Reading Rescue and 
Fundations. 

 

Teachers will identify bottom 1/3 of students in grades K - 5 and 
work with their teams and/or coaches to identify promising 
practices to differentiate instruction for these students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Our school mission remains focused on providing a safe and nurturing learning community that advances the 
academic, social, emotional and physical development of all students. With a growing student population that is 
economically disadvantaged and that resides in temporary housing, many are faced with outside challenges that 
impact their ability to effectively engage in the teaching and learning dynamic of the classroom. Based on the 2017-18 
NYC School Quality Snapshot, 90% of parents are satisfied with the teachers helping their children learn.  

These gains were made through the school’s strategic collaboration and partnership with the Morningside Center for 
Teaching Social Responsibility, which has supported the school with the implementation of 4Rs social-emotional 
curriculum (Reading/Writing/Respect and Resolution) that works with teachers and students to build community and 
develop a vision; develop understanding and dealing with feelings; understanding and respecting others – becoming a 
better listener; standing up for yourself while respecting others – learning to be assertive; understanding and dealing 
well with conflict; celebrating diversity and countering prejudice; sustaining the caring community: making the 
differences. Additionally, the social workers provided through the school’s partnership with Children’s Health Fund 
Healthy & Ready to Learn/Counseling-in-Schools and New York Foundling through the TC REACH partnership also 
have helped to expand the school’s capacity to build the type of supportive environment that has resulted in a 
significant reduction in the OORs data as well as increases in parents’ perceptions about their children’s learning 
environment. 

Despite the gains, the school remains concerned about the attendance and chronic absenteeism rates as well as the 
academic and non-academic supports for students and families. Some of the more specific needs center on mental 
health and social emotional development disorders (i.e. trauma, oppositional defiance disorders, attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorders, mild Asberger’s/Autism and depression) that require significant supports for students, 
families and staff.  

To strengthen the school's academic supportive environment during 2018-19, we will continue to collaborate with key 
partners and implement additional activities as outlined below: 

  The school will implement restorative justice practices to support positive corrections to student behavior.  
  NY Foundling and Counseling in Schools social workers will use social-emotional data from Success Highways 

(a research-based social-emotional assessment system that will provide information about where students 
are in their SEL development so that the school can respond in a more meaningful and timely manner through 
the use of a tiered intervention system) to more timely identify individual students in need of additional 
counseling supports and to establish small group counseling sessions focused on relevant topics based on the 
data. In addition, they will meet with parents to provide outside support for the families. 

  Children Health Fund Health Coordinator will provide monthly workshops to staff and parents in regard to 

improving attendance and providing supports to families.

  Teachers will also be asked to engage more deeply with tier 2 attendance students to prevent them from 

falling into the at-risk category. Children's Health Fund will continue to provide intensive supports to students 
who are chronically absent.  

The school also will continue its work around expanded learning opportunities (ELO), in collaboration with Teachers 
College, Columbia University and Harlem Dowling Westside Center, to more effectively coordinate the 
complementary nature of the programming; to use academic and non-academic data to identify and recruit students 
for programs – especially students in the subgroups – so that there are increases in student enrollment and 
attendance consistency.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In 2018-19 we will continue to work towards building capacity in collaboration and sharing understandings of 
instructional expectations. According to a June 2018 end-of-year teacher survey administered by TC REACH for all of 
our K-5 teachers, the teachers felt they had an opportunity to prepare for their meetings, were clear about the next 
steps and reported a majority of their team time was spent on instructional talk. 

While there has been improvement in the attitudes and practices related to collaboration, there are ongoing concerns 
about the focus and the consistency of the collaboration. As stated in the 2017-18 School Survey, 88% of teachers 
responded positively to questions about Peer Collaboration. Additionally, only 62% of teachers responded positively 
about innovation and collective responsibility. 

Efforts to improve the school's practices around collaborative teachers will focus on helping teachers to better use 
their common preps and professional development time to engage with each other around the key instructional focus 
(designing coherent instruction and data-driven inquiry) for the year. 

Through professional development provided by the REACH Team and instructional consultants, teachers will 
strengthen instructional leadership and practices to improve student performance. There will be a concentrated focus 
on using research-based instructional strategies and interventions designed to build capacity in teachers and teams. 
Sessions will focus on and highlight areas of collaborative inquiry, data driven instruction, rigorous curriculum, and 
pedagogical content knowledge. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase to 93% in teachers' positive responses (strongly agree and agree) on the 
School Survey relative to peer collaboration.

support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Using the Danielson Framework for Effective Teaching, the areas of greatest need for teachers at PS 36 include: 
Designing Coherent Instruction (1E) and Engaging Students (3C). Additionally, only 73% of teachers on the School 
Survey reported that there is consistency in curriculum, instruction, and learning materials among teachers in the 
same grade level at this school.  

Based on the latest available Quality Review, the school was rated Proficient in terms of teachers "aligning 
assessments to the curriculum and using the data to determine student progress towards established goals"and 
proficient on ensuring engaging rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and 
aligned to Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards”. Over the past few years, the school has 
focused a lot of its professional development efforts around collaborative inquiry and data driven instruction, which 
has contributed to the proficiency rating. While the above noted data clearly indicates a strong trend of progress in 
the school's instructional leadership, there remains a need to develop teachers' pedagogical practices to consistently 
incorporate effective strategies. In our formulation, a root cause that should be targeted is greater school leadership 
around the development, implementation, and monitoring of the school's professional development plan to ensure 
that there is increased instructional consistency across all classrooms. 

Consequently, for 2018-19, the school will continue to collaborate with its key pedagogical partners (i.e. REACH, etc.) 
to develop and implement a professional development plan that includes research-based instructional strategies and 
interventions designed to build the capacity of teachers and teacher teams to more effectively impact student 
learning outcomes. More specifically, the plan will not only continue to focus on collaborative inquiry and data driven 
instruction but also on lesson study for rigorous lesson and unit plans that are aligned to the NYS standards; effective 
re-teach strategies to respond to periodic assessment data; and differentiation through the use meaningful student 
groupings. 

As the instructional leader, the principal will work to norm the instructional cabinet to support and supervise the 
implementation of the professional development plan by conducting “snapshot” walk-throughs, formal and informal 
observations coupled with timely, effective feedback that is actionable by teachers and teacher teams to more closely 
ensure consistent effective implementation of pedagogical learning into classroom instructional practice. In 
collaboration with the IC and professional development team, the principal also will track and use student data, 
teacher reflection sheets, and Advance data to routinely track progress and determine appropriate adjustments to 
the professional development plan and next steps for teacher practice.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

PS 36’s vision is to build strong family and community ties through the implementation of a community school model 
that offers a wide variety of services to students and families to develop the whole child – emotionally, socially, and 
academically. We want to ensure that we are leveraging the necessary community resources to effectively support 
our families and their children. To explore this, we collected, reviewed, and analyzed the following data.  

Based on the most recent NYC School Quality Snapshot, 91% of parents say that the school staff regularly 
communicate with them about how parents can help their child learn. 94% of parents say that they have 
communicated with their child's teacher about their child's performance. These perceptions accompany an increase 
in parent participation in the parent response rate on the NYC DOE Learning Environment Survey.  

Based on the school's internal record keeping, in 2015-16, the average parent attendance rate for school events was 
60%. In the most recent available Quality Review report, “parents shared that teachers and school leaders are 
continually “accessible” to them and their concerns are immediately addressed. One parent stated that, because of 
the school’s vision screening program, her child was referred to the Ophthalmologist and his vision concerns are 
now being addressed. They also stated that the staff’s expectations are guided by the goal of ensuring that all 
students are grade level proficient. Parents’ attendance at award ceremonies and appreciation events such as the 
Father’s Day breakfast and Grandparents Day has increased, thus demonstrating their commitment to the school. 
The above noted data clearly indicates a strong trend around the school's capacity to effectively make gains in 
taking advantage of community resources to enrich the lives of students and families -- more families are attending 
events and are expressing appreciation of the health and other interventions that their children are receiving. 
While this trend reflects progress in the school's efforts to build Strong Family and Community Ties, there remains a 
need to further increase parent engagement. Consequently, our priority need is to increase the use of our 
partnerships to more deeply and broadly engage our parents in support of all of our students. In our formulation, a 
root cause that should be targeted is the diversification of parent engagement activities along with more flexible 
scheduling to better accommodate a larger cohort of families.  

 

For 2018-19, our objective is to continue to increase parent participation and support so that they can more 
effectively support their children’s academic and non-academic growth. Consequently, we will continue to work with 
our key partners – particularly TC REACH, Children’s Health Fund, Harlem Dowling Westside Center – to implement a 
community school model. As part of this work, we will work to develop, implement, and monitor a comprehensive 
Family Engagement Plan that includes a focus on providing a greater number of workshops/activities to build families’ 
capacity to support their children’s academic and social-emotional development from home; to develop educators’ 
ability to engage families and understand their needs to facilitate appropriate and timely interventions; to provide 
families with differentiated access (i.e. multiple locations and schedules) to adult education opportunities like

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase in the number of parents attending family engagement events as evidenced by 
attendance sheets.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
To recruit Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT), the principal works with the NYC DOE's New Teacher Finder. Every spring, 
the principal uses teachers' completed preference sheets as well as student academic outcomes (i.e. class grades, 
most recent periodic assessment) to determine teacher assignments for the upcoming year. The school's support of 
highly qualified teachers (HQT) includes their participation in the school's professional development plan (i.e., training 
through Teachers College REACH around data use, assessment and lesson planning; and one-on-one coaching through 
classroom visits and debriefs. They also participate in the school's grade level teacher teams to help them further 
develop their collaborative professional learning and practice through the use of data.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
During the 2018-19 school year, P.S. 36 will continue efforts and commitment to using data to drive instruction and 
provide teachers with meaningful and quality professional development. Many data sources, (School-net, Baseline 
Assessments, New York City Performance tasks) and school documents (The Quality Review, Developing Quality 
Review Report, New York State School Report Card/Item Analysis Report, and the New York City – Department of 
Education – Elementary School Quality Snapshot), are examined to identify areas of highest need for AIS and topics to 
address during Professional Development. Structures are in place to ensure teachers are able to meet on a consistent 
basis to plan and participate in grade level/school-wide professional development and academic planning 
opportunities. Each year the school develops a comprehensive Professional Development Calendar that reflects the 
needs of teachers and students across all subject areas and accountability groups (ELA, Mathematics, English 
Language Learners, and Special Needs). The calendar may be modified to address areas of concern when and if they 
should occur. Teachers continue to receive training through Teachers College, Columbia University (REACH) around 
data use, assessment, and lesson planning. Teachers participating in the PD also will receive one-on-one coaching 
through classroom visits and debriefs. This training assists teachers in the ongoing process of assessing, analyzing data 
and determining grade level/school-wide priorities and planning next steps in instruction. To help prepare the 
paraprofessionals to better support students' ability to meet the NYS standards, they meet with the IEP and SETSS 
teachers to get a clear understanding of their students' needs and accommodations by reviewing their IEPs. They also 
participate in PD sessions on different interventions (i.e. Great Leaps, Wilson, etc.) to help them with classroom 
activities. The principal and assistant principal receive professional development support from the district (i.e. 
Metamorphosis, Data Wise, Theory of Action, and Rigor Toolkit, Danielson/Advance, and Giving Effective Feedback to

Part 4: SWP Schools Only 

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
In an effort to help Pre K students smoothly transition in our school, we have a set of activities that target teachers, 
students, and parents. The teachers across the Pre-K and Kindergarten classes participate in some monthly 
professional development sessions throughout the year where they share curricular plans and instructional strategies 
across their classrooms. They also participate in inter-visitations and debriefs throughout the Spring to share feedback 
on practices to support students. In June, Pre-K students begin to eat in the lunchroom to help them get acclimated to 
the additional school-wide routines. They also participate in the school's after-school program. For the parents, 
orientations are held in June and September to help them understand what to expect (i.e. daily routines, schedule, 
curriculum, etc.) in their child's new grade.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The decision-making process regarding the selection and use of assessments will include the input of teachers through 
their participation on the school's instructional cabinet (grade team leaders, admin, assessment coordinator/data 
specialist, SETSS teacher, and IEP teacher) and MOSL team (UFT chapter leader, admin, and six teachers). The IC will 
meet monthly to review the school's periodic assessments and ensure that the assessment items reflect the areas of 
concerned identified through prior assessments (i.e. NYSED summative item analysis) and alignment to the NYS 
standards to track progress by class, subgroups and content-area standards/skills; and to examine progress against 
the school's academic goals. Through the school's partnership with Teachers College, Columbia University (REACH), 
the instructional cabinet will receive professional development during their meetings to support their developing 
capacities to review the periodic assessments and the student outcome data. The findings of the instructional cabinet

subsequently will be used to inform AIS and other academic interventions for students as well as the school's 
professional development plan/calendar.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of 
this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. 
P.S.36 The Margaret Douglas School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Margaret Douglas School, P.S. 36 , will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., literacy, 
math and use of technology; 

providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision making in 
support of the education of their children; 

fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their 
child’s progress; 

providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in languages that 
parents can understand; 

providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach, 
communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of the school 
community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
At the core of TC REACH's community school model is teaching and learning. Our goal is to align all aspects of our 
wrap-around services with coherence and intentionality that is grounded in academic data and classrooms. Our 
instructional specialist assists our schools with implementing a series of periodic assessments based on the state 
exams, and the outcomes are presented to teachers to tailor their classroom instruction and identify small groups of 
target students. We base our professional development for teachers around trends identified in instructional learning 
walks of classrooms and around periodic outcome data. In addition, we use academic data to guide programming for 
ELO and work to build connections between the school day and out of school time to support student achievement. 
We make efforts to support our schools in developing parent workshops that help parents understand skills they can 
reinforce at home. We have seen growth in grade 3 - 5 ELA and math outcomes over the past several years; in early 
results of the 2017-18 state test scores, we saw 100% of one section of third graders reach grade level expectations in 
both ELA and Math and 100% of one section of fifth graders reach grade level expectations in ELA. On our benchmark 
assessments, we've seen constructed response outcomes in ELA improve by nearly double the percent comparing last 
year's students to this year's students. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, our community school work will provide all students and families with academic resources, ELO 
opportunities, and wellness resources so that we will see a 5% increase in attendance rates, a 5% increase in parent 
participation rates, and a 5% increase in ELA and math performance on the state exams for each of grades 3, 4 and 5. 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
We believe that supporting students with wrap-around services and partners in their educational careers will help 
them to reach their academic potential. Providing students with a variety of engaging and rigorous ELO/ELT learning 
experiences -- for remediation or enrichment -- will help to spark student interest and support skills that can be 
translated into the classroom. Our attendance, health and wellness initiatives will help to minimize barriers to 
learning and build healthy habits so that students can come to school regularly and be prepared to learn. Engaging 
with families as partners for their students and to regularly celebrate student success will help to build support 
networks for students that emphasize the value of education and the importance of motivation in achieving academic 
goals. 

 

 
Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan 

Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance 
Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services 
provided. As well as supporting schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to 
support your school’s instructional focus.

Part 3c. Describe how the school will partner with the Lead CBO to do the following: 
1. 

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

PS 36 and TC REACH will continuously collaborate to ensure that the Community School program activities meet the 
NYC DOE requirements for a Community School. Due to the limited funding under the Community Schools Grant 
Initiative (CSGI) we do not have enough funding to hire a full-time CSD but REACH has worked with the school to bring 
on board a part-time community school coordinator. The REACH director will support the asset and needs assessment 
process and provide overall support for the principal to coordinate activities. The CSC will collaborate with the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

attendance and student support teams to monitor attendance and wellness efforts; the CSC will also work with the 
parent coordinator to support parent engagement workshops and parent outreach. 

Data is shared across partners on an on-going basis to ensure that students are targeted for the right interventions. 
The student support team meets monthly to review case loads and monitor transitions with mental health supports; 
the attendance team meets weekly to monitor students targeted for each tier of supports; TC REACH provides 
support for Harlem Dowling to connect the school day with after school experiences for students. In the coming 
school year, TC REACH plans to hold more frequent meetings across the multiple stakeholders to further improve 
communication around student needs. 

Families have multiple opportunities to provide input around desired programming through the help of the parent 
coordinator and community school events like the forum. The REACH Family Engagement Coordinator works with the 
PC to develop and administer parent surveys to begin to obtain their input around the different topics for workshops. 
REACH also provides support for schools to hold annual parent forums, which is another key element to provide 
parents with a chance for feedback. We work with the PA leadership and PC to develop the calendar of activities 
around REACH's family engagement pillars - parents as partners, educators as partners, adult education, and 
celebrations. At each activity, families are surveyed about needs and interests as well as their interest and availability 
to volunteer in support of different aspects of the work. It is anticipated that as the number of parents at family 
events increases, we will be able to expand the network of individuals engaged in the development, implementation 
and monitoring of the family engagement calendar events. The intention is to ensure that the programming not only 
facilitates strong family and community ties but also meaningful ones. 

PS 36, REACH, and the other partners have established several layers of data-driven interfaces to support our 
community school work. The school's AP works with CHF to monitor the student sorter and attendance heat map on a 
weekly basis at attendance teams to monitor student progress. The principal and REACH director review REACH 
assessment data and strategize short-term and long-term plan adjustments. The team responsible for academic 
intervention services and the principal ensure formative data across K-5 is regularly monitored and teachers are 
tasked with monitoring interventions and progress of target students. The student support team (NY Foundling, 
Children's Health Fund, and the guidance counselor) meet monthly with the principal to monitor SEL needs. Next year 
there will also be a restorative justice team that will help support universal implementation of RJ practices and 
monitor their success. The principal and PC use a variety of data sources that may include parent survey data, teacher 
outcomes on PD checks for understanding, feedback surveys, instructional artifacts, and student work from ELO/ELT. 
There are also bi-annual data dialogues with REACH, the school leadership and key partners. 

 

 
Part 4 – Community School Partnerships Oversight 

Part 4a. Key Staff and Partners 
1.  Name and describe the scope of involvement of all community partners working in the school (include partners 

supporting ELT, counseling, enrichment, etc.) 

2.  Name the members of your Community School Team and how meetings will be organized and structured to 

engage all stakeholders and be focused on results. 

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the

There will be several REACH key personnel and partners that will be responsible for the design, implementation, 
monitoring and refinement of the Community School activities at PS 36. The REACH key personnel include: Catherine 
Hogg who is the REACH Director and supervises the entire university-assisted, community school initiative for 
Teachers College, Columbia University; Kyle Hagenburger who is the Expanded Learning Opportunities Specialist and 
manages all aspects of the ELO time, after school, and summer programming; Danielle Proscia who is the Instructional 
Specialist and is responsible for the design and delivery of all teacher professional development activities; REACH will 
be hiring a part-time community school coordinator who will help support the REACH components around 
attendance, wellness, and parent engagement; REACH will also employ a part-time Family Engagement Coordinator. 
REACH key partners that are responsible for elements of the CS program at PS 36 include the staff of NY Foundling - a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 
 
 

licensed social worker, supervisor, and family outreach specialist. Harlem Dowling employs instructors for their after 
school programming and also include TC graduate students in some of their programs; the site director is Jenny 
Fernandez; Children's Health fund has a site manager - Ginelle Wynter - who implements the Healthy and Ready to 
Learn Initiative; they also employ a full-time licensed counselor for art therapy through Counseling in Schools. There 
are several school-based staff who are involved in CS programming including: the parent coordinator, guidance 
counselor who works with NY Foundling and Counseling in Schools, and the assistant principal who works with the 
principal and REACH staff to improve teacher practice through PD and supervision. 

REACH, PS 36, CHF, and Harlem Dowling will continuously collect, analyze and reflect on data across the five key areas 
to evaluate the program and assess the impact of activities on student achievement in order to make appropriate and 
timely adjustments. Qualitative (i.e., primarily focus group and survey data from stakeholders, learning walks) and 
quantitative data (ie., student attendance and behavioral incidents, promotion and assessment data such as test 
scores from grades 3-5) is used to monitor and evaluate the work both to inform decisions on how specific 
interventions might be improved (ongoing formative assessment) and to measure progress toward final outcomes 
(annual summative evaluation). In addition to reviewing the school's annual data through NYSED and NYC DOE, 
REACH will collaborate with school staff to gather and analyze data specific to the five key areas. For instance, the ELO 
Specialist will use the NYSAN Quality Self-Assessment Tool to monitor ELO activities, in addition to tracking 
attendance through Kinvolved, and conducting regular reviews of student work from the programs. The Family 
Engagement Coordinator will collect attendance and feedback data from parents at each event. CHF will use 
Kinvolved and the Heat Map to collect data on student attendance and include interventions in the Student Sorter so 
there is a comprehensive data set for each student. The data collected and documented through the Sorter will be 
analyzed for action/program adjustments. While data is analyzed, shared with the school, and used by the REACH 
team throughout the year, twice per year, REACH, its partners, and PS 36 leadership meet for a data dialogue so that 
they have dedicated time to collectively review the information and make decisions about any adjustments that may 
be needed. 

 
Part 4b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to 
implement the Community School program. 
Human resources needed to support this work include: REACH staff, parent coordinator, attendance team members, 
student support team members, other partner CBO staff (Harlem Dowling supervisor; NY Foundling counselor and 
family coordinator; Counseling in Schools counselor; Children's Health Fund site coordinator). Instructional resources 
needed include access to the school's curriculum so it can be used to support PD and ELO experiences. We will need 
access to and opportunities to meet with teachers during professional development to monitor our efforts and 
communicate about the programs.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

P.S. 36, Title III instructional program will provide English Language Learners with 
supplemental instructions after school. The program will service ENL students in grades 1-4, 
who scored at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding levels on the NYSESLAT. 
The data used to indicate need for ELL after school is to be found in the EDAT, using the RLAT 
results and RESI data delineating each student's needs. Further data used come from informal 
assessments by the ENL providers and input from ELLs' classroom teachers. 
 
The Title III program will be named, We Are The World: the ENL After-School Program. The 
content theme is: Immigrants enrich the United States through their cultural contributions and 
knowledge of far-away places. Students are encouraged to value and describe in English the 
many riches of their home countries, cultures and languages even as they also meet the linguistic 
objectives of acquiring academic English. 
Calendar and Schedule: The program will meet twice a week for a total of 28 sessions. The 
program will tentatively begin Tuesday, January 8, 2019 through Thursday, April 18, 2019 from 
3:00 to 5:30 p.m. for grades 1 through 4. Each teacher will have 1 group for an hour 15 mins. and 
they will rotate classes in this way, the ENL teacher and the content teacher will address all 
students equally, enhancing both academic english and content knowledge. 
Instruction for grades 1-4 will focus on comparing and contrasting students' lives in their home 
countries and their lives in the United States.  For example, grades 1-2, will focus on how the 
four seasons in North America include leaves falling in autumn. For grades 3-4 the seasons are 
studied as more pronounced the further north we move on the globe. A fuller explanation of 
global movements is added, and why rain forests are unique to the tropical belt which has just 
two seasons: rainy and dry. Such contrasts provide many teachable moments and lessons for the 
fundamentals of geography and biology. These same contrasts help explain clothing, food 
customs, flora and fauna differences between home countries and the New York area. 
Certified ENL teachers will provide rigorous standard aligned instructions that are grade level 
appropriate. We will design learning opportunities that integrate reading, writing, speaking and 
listening within a multicultural content framework. 
 
We will naturally focus on grade and age appropriate, academic rigor, embedded in high 
motivational and fun activities so that the students will come to understand that learning and 
knowledge acquisition is a culture open to everyone, and that can be enjoyable for its own sake. 
Such educational skills will be acquired holistically through projects, games, and role playing 
around favorite subjects and fun projects such as growing caterpillars into butterflies: watching, 
describing and recording the life cycle of butterflies. 
Students will also work on their writing skills through journaling. They will be encouraged to 
articulate , write and share their unique experiences of being world travelers coming from 
different cultures.The following supplies and materials will be purchased:  Materials aligned to 
the theme of immigration such as the paperback, Coming to America: The Kids Book About 
Immigration by David Fassler; Coming to America: The Story of Immigration by Betsy Maestro; 
Immigrant Kids by Russell Freedman. Also from the physical sciences, the migration of monarch

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
ENL parents will be provided with workshops sessions designed to encourage parents to view 
themselves as an indispensable educational resource, and motivate them to become active 
participants in their children's holistic educational experience. The workshops are scheduled 
based on the availability of the parents. The following outlines the workshop topics:1) January, 
2019. The benefits of a multicultural approach to education: How your child can successfully 
introduce narratives from the home country to enrich the North American classroom. 
2) February, 2019. How to support your child by developing and extending their literacy skills, 
by building on the home language. 
2) March, 2019. The skills of comparison: comparing and contrasting a student's home country 
to the United States; bringing this bi-geographical, bicultural, and bilinguistic knowledge into the 
classroom successfully. 
3) April, 2019. Education begins at home. From drawing upon life experiences to cultivating 
habits of literacy in the home language and English. 
The ENL Teacher will conduct the above workshops. At the end of the year, a culminating 
activity for all participating parents will be provided. Parents will be notified of these workshops 
through flyers and cover letters written in the home languages, email and phone calls. Parent 
instructional materials will also be provided in their home languages, and bilingual teachers will 
be present to provide further home language support. Records, including agendas, letters, flyers 
and attendance sheets, will be maintained in an ELL Parent Engagement Binder.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 36 is currently using the  Fountas and Pinnell Assessment System Grades K-2/3-5. ,  El  SOL (Series of activities to measure 
literacy skills of Spanish and bilingual students) and New York City Performance Tasks to assess the literacy skills of our 
ELLs.   The data compiled from these sources are periodically analyzed and reviewed and are used to prioritize areas in need of 
improvement.  Teachers are provided with appropriate resources and professional development and support to ensure 
students' needs are being addressed across all discipline areas. The teachers also create their own assessments to determine 
students reading and writing strengths and weaknesses.  The data are also used to differentiate instruction and to provide the 
students with additional academic support.     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

ENL Teachers meet with classroom colleagues during common planning meetings to review the data. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
In the beginning of the school year, academic goals are established for all students and subgroups.  These goals are aligned to 
expectations set forth by the New York State/City Departments of Education.  The school has a weekly period dedicated to 
analyzing data (formal/informal),  looking at student's work and evaluating the effectiveness of instructional programs.  This 
critical structure is in place to monitor progress and to make changes when necessary. The success of our programs are 
evaluated by the number of students displaying progress and/or reaching proficiency annually on the NYSESLAT and how much 
time students spend in ENL classes and after school programs. 
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL Teachers meet with other teachers during team meetings to discuss interventions for students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Data is continuously reviewed to identify students who are failing to meet standards.  Each case is examined on an individual 
basis and appropriate steps are taken to ensure that students are receiving the appropriate TIER of intervention.  When 
necessary, ELLs receive targeted academic support.  Teachers are encouraged to use components of the Standards Based 
Curriculum (READYGen and Go Math) that are designed specifically for addressing the needs of ELLs.   As we examine the data 
gathered on our ELLs, we will consider the techniques and strategies outlined in the RTI models from New York City and New 
York State.   We will examine the model especially as it relates to tiering and goal setting, with short  teaching cycles and 
frequent formative and sumative assessments to inform further instruction.  The RTI through tiering allows teachers to better 
serve students' needs and more readily identify those ELLs that may be designated for special education.  Response to 
Intervention also allows teachers to assist  special education students ELLs in need of more intensive instruction.  Instruction is 
guided and  based on specific modalities for learning, or strategies that have been designated effective.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Based on EDAT, and NYSITELL Data (indicated for kindergarten students in Part III: Assessment Analysis) most of the students 
entering P.S. 36 are in the Expanding/Transitional Levels.  At least 50% of new ELLs who are entering at the higher grade levels 
are classified as Entering. Based on NYSESLAT data (indicated in  Part III: Assessment Analysis), most of the tested students in 
grades 1-5 are in the Transitioning/Expanding/Commanding Levels. The greatest challenge to acquiring English is in the Writing 
modality. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL teacher shares information with admin and staff during weekly team meetings and during instructional cabinet 
meetings. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

In our Freestanding ENL program, we provide instruction in English with home language support.  As per CR Part 154, 
we incorporate the two types of ENL:  Stand-alone ENL instruction to develop English Language Skills so that students 
can succeed in core content courses and Integrated ENL to build English language skills through content area 
instructions.  Generally, students are group by grade and proficiency level.   
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            The following are the instructional minutes delivered to students:  Students who scored Entering receive 180 minutes 
of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA.  Emerging students receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL, 180 
minutes Integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes Integrated ENL in Social Studies.  Students who are Transitioning receive 90 
minutes of ENL/ELA and 90 minutes in Science.  Students who are Expanding receive 180 minutes in ENL/ELA. Students who 
are Commanding receive 90 minutes in integrated ELA.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Collaboration is expected between the classroom teacher and the Freestanding ENL teachers.  Since research shows that the 
classroom environment provides limited opportunities for ELLs to produce academic language in English, one of our primary 
missions in our Freestanding ENL program is for our students to be given ample opportunities to produce oral language 
through activities and group work using the push-in or pull-out model to  maximize students' acquisition of the English 
language.    
 
Under the push-in model, ELL students are learning the content being taught in their mainstream classroom and the ENL 
teachers are co-teaching with the classroom teacher or providing small group instruction based on the classroom curriculum. 
In the mainstream classroom, students are using the Ready Gen curriculum. The ENL teacher pushes in during ELA and related 
subject areas, and supports classroom lessons by using scaffolding such as modeling, bridging connections between new 
concepts and prior knowledge, contextualizing by using realia or graphic representation, and schema building by previewing 
texts or using organizers to prepare for reading a text. Differentiation includes use of graphic organizers, leveled texts, teacher-
made templates for writing units, personal word walls for students, and vocabulary development in order to make content 
comprehensible to all ELLs. The ENL teacher provides support to classroom teachers by making themselves available during 
common preps and copies of the pacing calendar with teaching points is provided to the ENL teacher for planning. 
 
During pull-out periods, all ELL students are learning thematically-based units in the ENL program. Thematic units are aligned 
with the NYC scope and sequence and Common Core learning standards. Content areas are embedded in the thematic units 
and taught simultaneously through the curriculum. Grade appropriate content is taught using these thematic units. Instruction 
in the ENL program is taught in English through the use of scaffolding strategies. This includes use of scaffolding strategies that 
include modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, and text re-presentation. Also, collaborative learning activities 
are used, hands-on activities are planned, technology is infused into the curriculum and various materials are utilized, such as 
authentic texts, books on tape, books in the students' native language, and the internet for support. Bilingual dictionaries and 
glossaries are also used. The ENL classroom is having a Promethean board installed for this academic year, and also makes use 
of DVD and CD players to deliver instruction in a variety of modalities by using videos, other visuals, audio and interactive 
writing. 
 
The ENL classroom is a student-centered place where the ELL community is fostered and students are provided with a safe 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

environment: safe from ridicule and lack of understanding and respect, where the ELLs' cultural backgrounds are validated. 
ENL methodologies are used by the ENL teacher to make content comprehensible to all students and meet their needs. ENL 
approaches are included, but not limited to, the Language Experience Approach, where students are encouraged to share an 
experience, then produce language in response to their first-hand, multi-sensory experience and the whole language 
approach, where students develop their language skills in all four modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing. ENL 
instruction incorporates the components of Balanced Literacy, such as read-alouds, shared readings, interactive writings, 
guided reading and independent reading and writing. Differentiation of process, product or content is done through the use of 
small group instruction, use of graphic organizers and supplemental materials. 
 
ELLs are given opportunities to develop their language skills in all four modalities through their reading experiences, writing 
activities, listening activities and opportunities to speak on a daily basis by sharing their work, having discussions with their 
peers in which the ELLs are provided a respected space in which to use their limited knowledge of English, making 
presentations and actively participating in a class of respectful and good-listening peers. 
 
In addition, native language support is provided for the ELLs, even as immersion methods are central to the ENL program. 
Code-switching is studiously avoided. However, home language supports are available through the use of bilingual dictionaries 
and readers, bilingual teachers and staff. They are made use of as necessary, particularly for the Entering and Emerging ELLs. 
 
Assessments are also an important part of the ENL program. Both formal and informal assessments are utilized. This variety of 
assessments, as discussed above, drive instruction as teachers collaboratively plan using the information gathered to meet the 
needs of the students.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Upon admittance to school, Spanish-speaking students are evaluated using both the Spanish Lab and English on the NYSITELL. 
This ensures that we find a good baseline for students in both languages.  At P.S. 36, informal assessments of home language 
proficiency are also used by bilingual instructors who speak Chinese and French. Even though our program offered is ENL, 
informal assessments in the home languages continue with bilingual instructors throughout the year. The goal is for the ELLs to 
retain their home languages even as they gain a mastery of English.

•           Native Language Support (used to clarify instructional content) but without code-switching. 
.  Instruction includes BICS and CALPs simultaneously and oral and literacy instruction combined. 
  
Plan For ELLs receiving 4-6 years of service and Long Terms ELLs include: 
•     Provide academic Intervention Services/ Encourage students to participate in  
•     ENL After-School Academy. 
•     Differentiate Instruction/focus on academic vocabulary development, reading comprehension 
            and writing skill building, which usually constitutes the greatest challenge for long-term ELLs. 
•     Encourage effective communication between home and school to ensure the long-term ELLs are receiving               effective 
parental support. 
•     Using visual/oral/auditory technological aids and manipulatives to drive instruction. 
  
Plan for former ELLs: - For at least two years (following the school year in which a student is exited from ELL status), former 
ELLs receive at least one half of one unity of study of ENL (90 minutes per week) and are eligible for certain specified 
testing accommodations. These ELLs often struggle with achieving grade level on the ELA, and need supports to assist in full 
grade level mastery. This means providing academic language and literacy supports as ongoing assessments dictate. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The instructional programs used in the school are modified to meet the needs of ELLs who are also SWD.  These strategies 
include simplifying language, using speech that is appropriate for students' language ability and using oral/visual/auditory 
and technological aides.  School-wide instructional blocks are also modified to meet the needs of these students.     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
As indicated in the New York City Department of Education Flexible Programming Guide, P.S. 36 uses the following 
models (instructional/scheduling) to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the 
least restrictive environment: 
  
General Education with Special Education Teacher Services (SETTS) - Flexible services provided by a special education 
teacher designed  to help students remain in the general education classroom and utilize the combined expertise of the 
general and special education teacher. The school provides direct SETTS services in a separate location. 
  
Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) - An integrated program that allows for students with disabilities to be educated with age 
appropriate peers without disabilities in the general education classroom with the support of a special education teacher 
accommodating and modifying instruction.  When the general education and special education teachers team teach, they 
meet in advance to co-plan and prepare lessons, activities, and projects that incorporate all learning modalities.  The school 
provides ICT programs  for students on a full-time basis. 
  
Response to Intervention - The school provides intervention using the three-tiered model.  As per the English Language Policy 
and Reference Guide, Response to Intervention approaches are applied to ELL students who enter with lower level proficiency 
in their home language.

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
In the beginning of the year, all ELLs who did not meet state standards in ELA and/or math are identified for Academic 
Intervention Services (AIS).  In addition, all ELLs who failed to reach a level of proficiency on the NYSESLAT are identified.  The 
parents of these students are notified of their child's status. These students are prioritized for AIS support which includes: ENL 
After school Academy, AIS Push In/Pull-out Models, Weekend/After School Remedial Programs, Columbia University Power 
Lunch, Adult Reading Buddies, Accelerated Reading Program, Star Fall, and Star Math.  These programs offer support in English 
Language Arts and Mathematics development.

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In addition to the implementation of new Common Core Curriculum, during the 2017-18 School Year,  we will use the 
Renaissance Learning and  Getting Results with English in a Flash.  The purpose of these programs is to assist ELLs in second-
language acquisition and building reading comprehension.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Because Spanish-speaking ELL numbers have dropped, many of the parents of remaining ELLs, have requested ENL or 
immersion-based programming, and in addition, we have increasing numbers of ELLs who have a variety of home languages, 
including French, Arabic, Chinese, and indigenous African languages such as Wolof. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

All ELLs are invited to participate in all supplemental services throughout the school.  Parents are notified and given the 
opportunity to enroll students in all programs offered.  Such programs include: 
  
Title III - ENL After-School Academy - Common Core aligned academic support and instruction in Literacy and Mathematics. 
There is a concentrated focus on the four modalities tested on the NYSESLAT (Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking).  In 
addition, students receive instruction in Mathematics.  Pedagogues are licensed ENL and Bilingual Teachers. Classes meet 
twice a week after school.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
This year we are using the following instructional materials and technology to support our ELLs:  Achieve 3000 reading 
program, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, Attanasio Reading/Writing/Mathematics workbooks for ELLs,  Foundations 
-  Phonics/Reading Program,  RALLY Education - Essential Skills in Reading and Mathematics and  Ready New York CCLS - ELA 
and Mathematics.    
In addition, ELLs are assessed and instructed using the following computer base software/programs:  Star Fall/Accelerated 
Reader, English in a Flash and Star Math.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

             For ENL, native language is used to support the students in all academic areas, but without resort to a 1940s, B. F. 
Skinnerian back and forth language acquisition model and code-switching. Immersion ENL techniques are kept at the center of 
instruction.  However, all ELLs receive home language support as a scaffold, based on grade expectations and level of academic 
proficiency. Specific instructional supports such as bilingual instructors, dictionaries, and curricula (Into English, Components 
from ReadyGen and GoMath specific to ELL instruction) are available to address these needs. 
   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The administration ensures that teachers are provided with appropriate materials to provide the differentiated instruction that 
is needed across all discipline areas and modalities. Materials are reviewed and aligned to grade level placement.  All support 
service providers (Reading Team,  Harlem Dowling, and ENL After School Academy) plan and implement instruction/activities 
aligned to Common Core Standards and expectations of the designated grade levels and ages of our students. 
  
Support to ELLs-SWDs include: 
•     Grouping students by academic needs, according to data and goals on their IEP 
•     Small group instruction – 3 to 5  students  
•     Providing instruction three to five days a week: one 45 minute period each day 
•     SETTS teacher working with classroom  teachers to analyze data 
•     Diagnosing and addressing  the students’ needs.   
•     Participating in the development of the Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) for each student. 
•     Tracking the instructional progress of SETTS students to ensure that academic needs are being met. 
•     Maintaining a data binder documenting students' progress 
•     Conferring with students, classroom teachers, School Based Support Team Members, and parents. 
  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
NOT APPLICABLE: neither last year nor this coming year, does PS 36 share a building. But if a co-location were to happen in the 
future, the ENL programs would be coordinated between the two schools, beginning with the use of common instructional 
materials and technology to support our ELLs:  Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT, Attanasio Reading/Writing/Mathematics 
workbooks for ELLs,  Foundations -  Phonics/Reading Program,  RALLY Education - Essential Skills in Reading and Mathematics 
and  Ready New York CCLS - ELA and Mathematics.    
In addition, ELLs are assessed and instructed using the following computer based software/programs:  Star Fall/Accelerated 
Reader, English in a Flash and Star Math.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At the point of enrollment, an effort is made to establish effective communication between home and school. Parents or 
guardians are invited to tour the building and to share any concerns/questions they might have with school pedagogues or 
translators who speak the home language.  Such tours are conducted by the School Administration, ENL Instructor, Parent 
Coordinator and Guidance Counselor.  Within five days, the parents are provided with the mandated orientation meeting. 
Students whose parents elect the PS 36  ENL program are encouraged to work with a buddy or partner, and with bilingual 
instructors and staff to assist in daily activities and familiarize themselves with the school and basic routines. 
    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 At this level (elementary school) elective language courses are not offered. 
    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:  NOT APPLICABLE. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The school is committed to providing on-site meaningful professional development across all content areas for all teachers of 
ELLs. 
The instructional initiatives for the year include:  A rigorous curriculum that supports more coherent instruction in Math, 
Reading and Writing and consistent inquiry and data analysis to ensure more accurate measures of student performance.   
  
Professional development topics include: 
  
Teachers' College Writing Initiative  
Fountas & Pinnell Assessment System 
Social/Emotional Learning Analyzing Benchmark Data (ELA/Math 
Introduction into the Inquiry Process (Targeted Population) 
 
In-house PD by the ENL Teacher will be provided. Workshop topics will include: 
Differentiated instruction for ELLs in the classroom 
Scaffolding for ELLs in the content areas. 
Workshops for Learning Communication Skills for Teaching ELLs, covering the following topics: slower, clearer enunciation, 
language simplification, repetition, defining all terms used. In summary, learning to teach a subject simply, using multiple 
examples and visuals. 
Learning to include and validate the ELLs in the classroom through reference to their cultural and geographical backgrounds. 
Encouraging the ELLs to speak up in the classroom, to value and draw upon their unique experiences and perspectives. 
Materials from the following texts would be used: Pauline Gibbons, Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning, 2nd ed. 
(Heineman, 2014), and Kama Einhorn, Easy & Engaging ESL Activities...For Every Classroom (Scholastic, 2001). The ENL Teacher 
will provide bibliographic resources to the rest of the faculty that includes, "Understanding Language: Key Principles for ELL 
Instruction," found on the Stanford University website. (http://ell.stanford.edu/policy), also, "Application of Common Core 
Standards for English Language Learners," (http://www.corestandards.org/assets/application-for-english-learners.pdf). The PD 
opportunities published in OELL News by the NYC DOE will also be made available. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ENL Teacher will conduct PD with staff as described above in #1. Teachers also participate in TC, QTEL and 
OELL workshops. Our focus continues to be the development of academic language, using the text, Building Academic 
Language by Jeff Zweirs, as a reference. Training for all staff is accomplished by sharing resources, materials, and insights from 
professional development workshops in which ENL teachers participate. Records are maintained by having sign-in sheets for all 
PD's. In addition, the ENL teacher will receive 50% of required PD hours dedicated to language acquisition through District 5 
and Manhattan Borough scheduled PD workshops for ENL teachers. Our ENL teacher is also an active member of TESOL, the 
professional organization of ESL/bilingual teachers, which conducts regular meetings.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school schedules meetings with the parents or guardians of English Language Learners at least once a year (in addition to 
parent-teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for 
parents or guardians), to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their child's English 
language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. The additional parent meeting 
will include school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child's language (in his/her home 
language as requested on the HLIS form). These meetings will be conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the 
language or mode of communication the parent or guardian best understands.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents are always encouraged to be active participants in their child's learning experiences.  The school will offer workshops 
and parental informational sessions focusing on some of the following topics: Understanding the Promotion Criteria for ELLS, 
Using Technology Based Programs to Support Student Learning, Understanding the Components and Structure of the 
NYSESLAT and Preparing for the City/State Assessments. In addition, PS 36 enjoys an active PTA which actively reaches out to 
and encourages the involvement of ELL parents. For example, our ELL parent population includes professionals who are 
encouraged to contribute to the school's annual Career Day during which parents of various professions come and address the 
student body about their careers.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Heather Jnbaptist, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used to assess P.S. 36’s written translation and oral interpretation needs are based 
on the Home Language Survey completed by parents upon registering the student into the public school system, 
ATS generated reports (Report of Preferred Languages), Blue Emergency Card Data and Parent/Teacher Surveys.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

Written

Language  

The majority of our non-English speaking 
parents are Spanish speakers. Therefore, 
the preferred language for written and 
oral communication is Spanish. Other 
languages spoken include: French, 
Vietnamese, Chinese, Hatian-Creole and 
Chinese. We aslo have staff members 
that are able to communicate with our 
parents in Chinese and French. If 
necessary, we will provide over-the-
phone translation services to assist 
parents in receiving information. 

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

The following are documents we disseminate to parents throughout 
the year: Information on school opening, parent-teachers 
conferences, special events, testing dates information, after-school 
programs, school leadership meetings, curriculum, school 
expectations, testing calendar and parents workshops. All 
communication is translated and sent to the parents in the language 
spoken at home.

Month/Frequency 

of Meetings  

How does 
your school 

plan to 
provide 

interpretation 

service(s)?  

 

The following are formal and informal face to face interactions with 
the parents: Parent- Teacher Conferences, outreach community 
events, workshops for parents, PTA events and Assembly/Award 
Ceremonies. The Guidance counselor and Social Worker also conduct 
formal and informal meetings. These interactions provide a good 
vehicle to keep parents abreast of all information they must obtain. 

 

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

As the overwhelming majority of limited-English-proficient families speak Spanish, our Spanish-speaking office staff 
will immediately contact the families in Spanish in the event of an emergency. The small number of families speaking 
languages other than English or Spanish are also fluent in English and have expressed a desire to be contacted in 
English on the HLIS form. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

P.S. 36 goal is to communicate with non-English speaking parents in their home language in order to support and 
share accountability and to provide them with access to information about their children's education options and 
experiences. To this end, a team of individuals will be responsible for translating all documents in a timely manner. 
The translation and Interpretation Unit will be utilized to translate documents in languages other than the above 
mentioned language spoken at home. After reviewing the Home Language Survey for language Spoken at home, the 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

school will display welcome posters in the languages as per the Home Language Surveys. In addition, the school will 
provide to parents whose vernacular language is other than English, a notification of their rights. Notices will also be 
posted in the Parent Coordinator's Office, in the lobby, Main Entrance, and Main Office. Parents will also be informed 
on their rights to obtain documentation or oral translation in their spoken language.            
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The goal of P.S. 36 is to communicate with non-English speaking parents. The following methods will be used to 
gather information from parents: A survey of the HLIS forms in which the parents indicate their preferred language of 
communication, both oral and written. During Parent-Teacher conferences, teachers will receive feedback from 
parents on obtaining information in their vernacular language. We will also mail surveys in which the parents will fill 
out and return to the teacher. We will review the information and when necessary, make every attempt to implement 
positive change.
