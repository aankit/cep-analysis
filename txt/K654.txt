Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8

School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you

monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title 

I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of Van Siclen Community Middle School is to empower and inspire all students to apply the knowledge 
and skills necessary to become problem solvers, achieve academic and personal success and to be college and career 
ready. As part of this process students will acquire the skills to become self-directed learners. Technology will be 
infused throughout the program to support student development of 21st Century skills. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Van Siclen Community Middle School is located in the East New York section of Brooklyn. 

 

Our instructional philosophy is designed to put students in the driver’s seat as it pertains to their development. 
Students learn best when they are driven by purpose and the learning is meaningful. Research shows that when 
students participate in the decision- making and the outcomes, motivation for the task improves. Also students 
become empowered and emotionally invested in the work they do.  

 

The Project/Problem Based Learning approach provides meaning and purpose to the work students are doing and the 
skills they are acquiring by performing the task. We are a community of caring adults who want to challenge and 
empower students academically and socially. All teachers have opted into the Teaching Excellence Network to further 
their skills reflectively to improve their pedagogy. 

 

Many teachers have demonstrated a willingness to help student become more proficient in their core competencies, 
and also work with them to develop extracurricular skills as well. This allows students to develop and apply their core 
skills in activities such as drama, poetry, robotics, coding, etc. 

We have identified values of the teachers who align themselves with the philosophy of the school. Teachers who are 
passionate about teaching and kids, and have the humility to collaborate with others to work towards a challenging 
goal. The school has a mix of knowledge and experienced teachers who are willing to grow a school culture. The 
school has established many norms and events that have begun to define who we are as a school community. 

 

Strategic partnerships include: CAMBA. National Training Network, Literacy Design Collaborative, Generation Ready, 
Teaching Excellence Network and The Achievement Network. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have a high level of special needs students and a transient students in temporary housing population whose 
specific needs are differentiation of tasks.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most progress over the past year is Effective 
School Leadership and Strong Family-Community Ties. We have been effective in establishing a positive culture as 
evident by our positive support environment feedback in the NYC School Survey. 

While we have established many components for a supportive learning environment, we recognize the need to

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

  Of the students assessed students in ELA during 2017-2018: 
  49% Level 1 
  32% Level 2 
  14% Level 3 
  4% Level 4 
  Of the students assessed students in Math during 2017-2018 
  60% Level 1 
  30% Level 2 
  9 % Level 3/4 
  Quality Review Findings: 
  Proficient-Though pedagogy, anchored in common beliefs, provides consistent instructional supports, including 

scaffolds and questioning, the use of strategic extensions that foster higher order thinking demonstrated in 
rigorous student work and discussions varies across classrooms. 

  Proficient-All curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). Curricula and academic tasks 

are revised using student work and data to support diverse student needs. 

  Proficient-The school uses common assessments in all subject areas, tracks student progress, and consistently 

checks for understanding. 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             15 

 

DTSDE Findings: 

  Classroom instruction did not faithfully implement components, such as purposeful grouping, that teachers 

included in their plan. 

  Teachers must begin to integrate differentiated activities into their daily lesson plans.  

We are in our 5th year of existence with a clear understanding that we must continue to ensure that our units of study 
incorporate multiple entry points and be simultaneously aligned to the Common Core Standards. 

PPO Findings: 

Teachers are still not consistently across classrooms providing differentiated instruction and support to ensure all 
learners have access to learning checking for understanding to make modifications, and providing rigorous instruction. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, ELA teachers will construct units of study whereas students are appropriately grouped to differentiated 
tasks/activities accompanied by appropriate supports to increase our English Language Arts Performance Index by 10 
points as measured by our NYS Report Card Performance Index report.

We regularly seek to engage key stakeholders to get their input on issues of concern to them. In our school community, 
it is important to maintain good communications with all stakeholders in order to identify and address the concerns 
they may have. Maintaining open communications with students is a priority to keeping ourselves accessible to students 
to be a source of support. Developing trust with students is a key to having them fully engage in the learning 
experiences designed for them. We have Morning Meet with students, where administrators address students about 
school, community or current events in order to reinforce values and hear student concerns. Student and teachers also 
meet in “Circles” three times per week, where life skills are discussed and students have a forum to problem solve with 
an experienced adult. Staff use the curriculum “Overcoming Obstacles” to facilitate discussion around important life 
skills and topics. The following data supports the effectiveness of these programs and show that students’ perception of 
the support they receive at VSC. 

 

Based on the NYC School Survey for 2017-2018:

  93% of students agree or strongly agree that teachers give extra help when I need it. 
  77% of students agree or strongly agree that there is at least one adult in the school that I can confide in. 
  81% of students agree or strongly agree that the school offers a wide enough variety of programs, classes, and 

activities to keep me interested in school. 

  92% of students agree or strongly agree that they feel safe and comfortable with teachers at our school. 
  89% of students agree or strongly agree that teachers treat them with respect. DTSDE Findings: 
  The school staff, students and parents credited the school leader with creating a safe and orderly school 

environment. The school's credo, "Responsibility, Effort, Collaboration," appears on its logo and is stenciled on 
hallway walls throughout the school. All school constituents were familiar with the credo and said that it 
represented more than words because adults and students truly aspire to embody these traits. 

  The school leader should allow opportunities for students to speak and contribute ideas to morning meet 

sessions. 

At VSC we have several structures in place to encourage collaboration between students in the classroom. We have a 
Problem and Project based philosophy where our core classes place emphasis on group work. Our approach to conflict 
resolution has demonstrated the ability to impact how students relate to and respect each other. However students do 
still not perceive their peers as being as supportive as the staff in the building. This is indicated by some of the following 
data. 

 

Based on the NYC School Survey for 2017-2018: 

55% of students say that their teachers support them when they are upset. 

  Only 69% of students agree or strongly agree that they are safe outside the school building. 
  90% of students agree or strongly agree that they are safe in the hallways, bathrooms, locker rooms, and 

cafeteria. 

  75% of students believe that at this school students harass or bully other students all of the time, most of the 

time or some of the time. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 we will build systems and structures to ensure that students feel supported emotionally at school, as 
measured by a 10% increase in the number of students who indicate that teachers support them when they are upset at 
school on the NYC School Survey.

school will implement to achieve the identified goal for this 
Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

Target

Who will be 
targeted? 

Timeline 
What is the 
start and 
end date? 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

Our Project/ Problem Based Learning encourages students to work 
collaboratively and has teachers explicitly teach social skills as part 
of the learning outcomes. 

Students will develop academic and social skills in diverse arts and 
sciences by way of clubs and activities. This allows students to build 
trusting relationships with adults outside of the regular curriculum. 
Also, students have a context to cultivate meaningful and positive 
relationships with their peers. 

Teachers will continue to attain feedback from students and parents 
regarding their interactions with students. This fosters reflective 
teachers that continue to improve upon the ways they support 
students.  

During our "Healing Circles" Advisory, students are mentored by a 
teacher using the Sanford Harmony Curriculum. The curriculum 
emphasizes strategies for success and life skills. This gives a forum 
for teachers and students to converse freely about things that 
impact them daily. 

We will reinforce the values of VSC during morning meet and use it 
to highlight encouraging acts as examples of exemplary student acts 
of respect. Morning meet will also be used to explain to students 
and families why acts of disrespect are not beneficial.

DTSDE Findings: 

Although teachers have access to a variety of assessment data, most teachers did not use the data to provide students 
with activities matched to their ability levels. 

Some teachers used instructional activities that engaged students at high levels however most classrooms were teacher-
centered with students participating compliantly in teacher directed activities.

Though pedagogy, anchored in common beliefs, provides consistent instructional supports, including scaffolds and 
questioning, the use of strategic extensions that foster higher order thinking demonstrated in rigorous student work and 
discussions varies across classrooms. 

NYC School Survey 2017-2018 

100% of our teachers believe that their professional development experiences this year have been sustained and 
coherently focused, rather than short-term and unrelated.  

100% of our teachers agree that professional development included opportunities to work productively with colleagues 
in my school. 

100% of our teachers believe that their professional development experiences this year included enough time to think 
carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas. 

 

We are in our sixth year of existence and our priority is to continue building a collaborative environment with a focus on 
having our new staff actively engage in professional development in a respectful and safe environment. 

Another priority being having a school wide common language around teacher effectiveness to impact teacher and 
student outcomes.

DTSDE Findings: 

The school leader changed the school's physical environment to mirror the change in culture. For example, in addition 
to having classrooms and hallways repainted, she arranged for the School Construction Authority to remove the old 
student clothing closets and built in cabinets from every classroom because they were in disrepair and appeared 
neglected. they were replaced with modern cabinets and bookcases that give classrooms a clean and modern look. 

Quality Review-Areas of Celebration 

High expectations are systematically conveyed to the entire school community, including teachers, students, and 
parents, through timely on-going communication, and delivery of effective feedback and guidance supports. School 
leaders consistently provide training to support the elements of the Danielson's Framework for Teaching.

Our priority is to continue to develop consistency in the use of effective pedagogical practices thus our need to continue 
to develop the skills of our administrators. 

PPO Findings: 

Teachers are still not consistently across classrooms providing differentiated instruction and support to ensure all 
learners have access to learning checking for understanding to make modifications, and providing rigorous instruction. 

Priority Needs-Despite the systems and structures currently in place to provide teachers with clear instructional 
expectations and consistent opportunities to improve their pedagogy through professional development, these efforts 
have not yet impacted student achievement to the desired extent. Student achievement in ELA and particularly in Math, 
remains a priority need. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
By June 2019 all teachers will consistently receive targeted feedback in Danielson's Component 3C (Engaging Students in 
Learning) and be provided support as needed as measured by an increase in levels of teacher effectiveness in 
component 3C.

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, 
Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be 
SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2018, all students will have access to a comprehensive educational experience for 2 hours 3 days a week, 
which will include activities that address the academic, social and emotional needs of all students. Student 
achievement will be measured by an increase of 5% meeting standards in ELA and MATH as measured by the state 
exams. 

 

 
Part 2 – ELT Program Type  

Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory? 

X 

Voluntary 

 

Compulsory 

If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the 
goal of serving at least 50% of students.  
All incoming grade 6 parents will receive a letter in June of 2017 delineating the importance of our Extended Learning 
Program and giving them the option to opt in before September 2017. All level 1 and level 2 7th and 8th graders have 
also been given a letter to opt into the Extended Learning Program indicating the need for parents to opt in to our 
program.  

 

 
Part 3 – ELT Program Description  

The ELT program will be offered to all students eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS), with the goal of 
serving a minimum of fifty percent of AIS-eligible students. 
Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School: 
 

Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning 
relevant and engaging. 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to 

promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of 

a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area. 

  Engage in outreach activities made to families. 

CAMBA, our CBO Community School partner, currently operates an after school program during the school year. 
CAMBA has extensive experience providing high quality, strength-based youth development programs. We will utilize

the teaching assistants and enrichment staff as part of a collaboration with VSC to offer an academic and enrichment 
program to our students. 

 

All activities in the ELT Program will align to school day learning goals, be sequenced, and establish explicit objectives 
for skills gains. Enrichment will incorporate project-based/problem based instructional methodology. Students will be 
mandated for ELA/MATH instruction based on their proficency levels but also be offered the opportunity to 
participate in STEM (piloting program, robotics) , ART, MUSIC , PEER MEDIATION, and COMPUTER SCIENCE. 

All academic classes will be facilitated by our own teachers in collaboration with CAMBA. 

Student out of school experiences will be comprised of trips to our local museums, Broadway shows, and an overnight 
team building trip to Camp Getaway. 

Outreach to families will be done in several ways: All incoming 6 th grade families will be introduced to the program 
during the summer orientation. Information about the ELT program will be put on the school web-site, and shared 
with the PTA and Parent Coordinator. Literature will also be sent home in student backpacks the last week and the 
first week of school.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             47 

 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Van Siclen Community Middle School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of 
Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. VSC will support parents and families of Title I students by: providing materials and training to 
help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 
providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to 
ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor their child’s progress; providing assistance to parents in 
understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; sharing information about school and parent 
related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in languages that parents can understand; providing 
professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach, 
communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of 
the school community; VSC’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs 
of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

VSC will support parents and families of Title I students by: providing materials and training to help parents work with 
their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; providing parents with 
the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision making in support of the 
education of their children; fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can 
effectively support and monitor their child’s progress; providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and 
Federal standards and assessments; sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and 
other activities in a format, and in languages that parents can understand; providing professional development 
opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach, communication skills and cultural 
competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of the school community; VSC’s 
Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all parents/guardians, 
including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The school community will 
conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I parents to 
improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms 
will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I 
program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

 

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: actively involve and engage 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I program as outlined in 

the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I Parent 

Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the 

required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement,

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

  Our Van Siclen Community Middle School  after-school program in collaboration with Camba, 
will provide support with intensive literacy instruction that is embedded within the context and 
content of non-fiction texts. The instructional focus is on improving the English proficiency and 
academic achievement of English language learners at our school. The priority in using the Title 
III funds is to improve learning in the subject areas of English Language Arts and Mathematics. 
The program serves a total of 40 English Language Learners of all proficiency levels. An 
analysis of student data from NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, DRP, and NYS English Language Arts 
and Math assessments, shows that the ELL sub-group continues to struggle with the academic 
content and is not on track to meet yearly targets. Consequently, additional support is needed in 
the four modalities; reading, writing, listening, and speaking, along with problem solving skills 
in order to be able to meet their academic needs and promote growth toward proficiency.  
Through our after school program, research-based strategies will be utilized to provide the ELLs 
with additional support in the areas of: language development, vocabulary acquisition (BICs and 
CALPs), reading comprehension, and problem solving skills. Instruction will be provided based 
on academic need and students' English proficiency level. Student progress will be monitored via 
on-going assessments that are built into the instruction.  
 
The after school  program will run for the entire school year beginning the second day of school 
until June 22, 2019 Monday -Friday from 3:00PM to 5:00PM. During the two hour session, all 
ELLs receive instruction that includes support from our ESL teacher. Entering ELLs (less than 
one year in the country) receive two hours of ESL instruction only with native language support. 
All other ELL students (Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding) receive math 
instruction for one hour and ELA/ESL instruction for the second hour. Both content area 
teachers will use ESL methodologies (i.e. QTEL strategies) to scaffold instruction for the ELL 
students, and ESL teachers support ELA instruction during the second hour.  
 
Instruction will be in English and is intended to increase English proficiency and provide 
students with the skills needed to solve real world problems in mathematics.  
Materials to be used include: NY Ready and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT( 6,7,8). 
Additionally, MYON (which allows students to read books not only in their language but at their 
level of English acquisition will be utilized. Disciplinary literacy strategies for ELLs will be 
utilized to support student reading of texts (libraries have been purchased specifically for ELLS). 
Attendance and academic  records will be maintained by our ESL teacher.  Program notification 
in the languages of our ELLS are always on the front counter in the main office and in the office 
of our guidance counselor.

  Professional development for teachers will be on-going throughout the year. Teachers will have 
opportunities to meet outside of instructional time to analyze pre-test, benchmark assessments, 
and students' work in an effort to identify strengths and areas in need of improvement. This 
information will be used to plan instruction and implement strategies to address identified needs. 
Professional development topics will include: strategies for supporting ELL instruction, effective 
strategies for supporting Reading Comprehension.  
 
Additionally, the ESL teachers will attend a workshop series on the topic of close reading and 
scaffolding for ELLs. 
Workshops for all teachers will also be conducted in-house with the exception of Teachers 
College workshops.

November- Strategies for Supporting ELL Instruction  
December- Close Reading Part 2  
January- Effective Strategies for Reading Comprehension  
February- Supporting ELLs in the Math Classroom  
Note: PD will be ongoing and differentiated based on need.  
All professional development is at cost with the exception of the ELL Raising Conference and 
the professional development offered by our Borough Support. This year our ENL teacher will 
be supported one on one by our Generation Ready ELL Consultant two days a week. 
PD will positively impact the progress of ELLs because the tools/knowledge gained by teachers 
will allow them to provide the necessary adaptations in content area instruction and materials for 
our learners. PD will also provide teachers with the tools to make content information accessible 
to students. 
Agendas and meeting sheets will be secured and maintained by Keisha Kemp-our Assistant 
Principal-in our PD binder.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
activities and meetings. Our parents are involved in PTA activities, SLT, Parent Teacher 
conferences, Title I and Title III meetings, and cultural diversity celebrations. Our parent 
coordinator and some of our bilingual staff facilitate parent participation in their child's 
educational development. We have a parent support system in place to make the students' 
families feel more welcomed and to give them access to the tools they need in order to fully 
participate in the education of their children. The ELLs Parent calendar for the ELLs parent 
orientation meetings, telephone conferences with parents of ELLs, access training to NYC DOE 
web sites, parent workshops to access technology programs such as SKEDULA-Pupil Path. 
Parent workshops will be conducted every month. Topics include:  
 Making the Transition to Middle School , Study Skills and Organization ,Applying to High 
School, English Language Arts  and NYSELAT exam Mathematics Exam, Summer Learning 
Opportunities ,Get Ready for the High School Application Process ,Making the Transition to 
High School , Cyber Safety and Help Your Child Manage Stress.  
These workshops will be facilitated by Andrea Roberts of Learning Leaders Services, our Parent 
coordinator and Patricia Prado -guidance counselor.   
To facilitate parental involvement with the school, support their child’s education, and to ensure 
non-English speaking parents are as participatory as English-speaking parents, Van Siclen 
Community Middle School has a number of established procedures in place.   We have  an 
existing multilingual in-house team to provide written translation and interpretation services. 
VSC makes use of existing written DOE translated documents that can be ordered or 
downloaded. All DOE provided parent translation letters are utilized by the school. If DOE 
provided translated documents are not available for a particular situation, in accordance with 
Chancellor's Regulation A-663, the team consisting of staff members will do the following: 
(If services cannot be provided in-house then the school will  use the NYCDOE translation unit, 
parent volunteers, or the services of the BIG WORD. 
 
Our CBO - CAMBA will continue to participate in workshops of ELL parents .  
 
The parental involvement activities for the parents of ELLs are designed to help parents support 
the academic success of their children. Communication with parents is done via flyers, school 
messenger, and SKEDULA-PUPIL PATH. All correspondence are sent home in the parents 
preferred language.  
 
All records inclusive of agendas, attendance sheets and invitations in parents' preferred language 
will be maintained by the school secretary in the main office.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Van Siclen Community Middle School uses the DRA kit & Ed Performance which assess students reading fluency and 
comprehension level. All information is complied and written on a class summary sheet for the DRA. One can also access a 
data bank through Ed Performance for results. From an early asssesment, a pattern has always shown that most ELL students, 
if not newcomers, read at a 3.5 grade level with minimal comprehension. 
In order to improve students' reading skills, instruction is differentiated to meet students needs. Web based program such as 
Starfall, Mathspace, Brain Pop ESL, Achieve 3000, and Write Excel are used as supplemental resources in order to help in 
language aquisition.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             62 

 

 

We currently support this effort by ensuring that our teachers receive the appropriate training in order to facilitate the 
embedded assessments/supports.  Our ENL teacher is also coached and professionally developed twice a week by A 
Generation Ready ENL coach retained by the school. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The leadership team evaluates ELL success through constant observations in the classroom, looking at student work and all 
assessments taken by school.    We have decided, based on an assessment of our program,  that our students  need targeted 
direct instruction as immediately and frequently as possible. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have an intervention schedule embedded into our instructional day.  Interventions may be 1 to 1 or web based using 
Achieve 300 and/or MathSpace.  We also provide our ELLs with targeted intervention during our advisory periods which focus 
on their academic language development. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our data has guided us to understanding that our ELLs must be grouped by ability. Groups should occur based on frequency of 
phonemic awareness and application, letter sounds acquired, and ability to segment a full word. An additional group of ESL 
students should be considered as students often lack phonemic awareness in their original language as well.  Our focus is 
differentiated, Tier 1 instruction to promote ELLs’ literacy development.   Our strategies include, but are not limited to building 
background knowledge: -starting with rich text and big ideas so students encounter and study abstract language and abstract 
concepts, and learn about the world.  Having students preview  key concepts and challenging vocabulary, as well as reviewing 
students’ understanding of important points .  When possible we also focus on drawing on and using students’ home 
languages.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Most students struggle on the NYSESLAT exam in the areas of reading and writing.  Writing trends occur with most ELL 
students that have not acquired the English language and are a part of bottom third.  A significant population of ELLs 
designated with special education services also test in the ELA exam below standards. This subgroup of students average 
reading level is on a third grade level and produce writing pieces that are grammatically incorrect, and lack penmanship.  A 
trend that is in the NYSESLAT data reveals most students being advanced to proficient in listening and speaking, but level as 
beginning to intermediate in reading and writing.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teachers as a group unpack student data during their Wednesday morning team meeting.  This ensures that our 
responsiveness is immediate. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             63 

 

 

Instruction is delivered in both push-in and pull-out model and follows a departmentalized approach. Our ENL Teacher 
push into the ELA classrooms and provide support using the co-teaching method when pushing in.   
Children receive the appropriate allocated number of periods for ENL services based on State mandates. Emerging 
and Entering  students receive two units of ENL which equals 360 minutes per week.  Transitioning and Expanding 
students receive one unit of ENL, equaling 180 minutes per week.  Students receive instruction in English.  All 
monolingual classes, which include special education   students, use homogeneous grouping according to LAB and 
NYSELAT results. Students travel together in block class and by grade  level. All students on each grade level are 
heterogeneously mixed by proficiency levels.

Paste response to questions here:    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

  Children receive the appropriate allocated number of periods for ENL services based on State mandates.  Emerging and 
Entering students receive two units of ENL which equals 8 periods per week.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive 
one unit of ENL, equaling 4 periods per week.  Students receive instruction in English.  All monolingual classes, which include 
special education students, use homogeneous grouping according to LAB and NYSELAT results.  
There will be one  ENL teacher who provides push in and pull out services for our students  . The school literacy lead teacher 
assists with ENL services for entering, emerging and transitioning , while the ENL teacher pushes into the ELA class.  Teacher 
professional assignments include small group instruction to meet State requirements.  For our entering/emerging students we 
have opted to provide 180 minutes of stand alone instruction and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.  For our transitioning 
and expanding students we have opted to provide 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA.   
Entering  and emerging students receive 2 units of ENL/8 periods, and transitioning/expanding students receive 1 unit of ENL 
per week.  
Based on the CR Part 154 and parent choice students participate in Free Standing English as a Second Language (Pull-out/ 
Push-in   
Model).  Our grade 6 contains one class which accommodates the Ell’s receiving ESL via the pull out/ push-in model. Class 
periods are 45 minute single block and 90 minute double block.  Our ESL teacher is fully certified. All students receive 
academic instruction as mandated by the CR Part 154, CR Part 100 Language Allocation Policy. 
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All content areas are delivered in English. Our ENL program uses the QTELL methodology in Project Based Learning  and is 
incorporated to foster English proficiency.  The Project Based Learning  curriculum implemented is aligned to the Common 
Core Standards.   Instruction in all ENL classes is aligned to the common core standards  in each content area.  Additionally, 
students are mainstreamed in art, music and physical education.  Students are introduced to technology in their content area 
classrooms and Ell students are exposed to the web based program Test Wizard and Brain Pop ESL.  Student receive word-to-
word dictionaries to be used in all content class.  Teachers are also well versed in Walqui's model (six typles of scaffolding) to 
ensure that our ELLS are engaged in activities.  Students are provided with dual language glossaries in math, science and social 
studies.  Word-to-word dictionaries, Webster dictionary and picture dictionary are used in English Langauge Arts classrooms.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We maintain an updated excel spreadsheet with the home languages of our ELL's.  Our testing coordinator is responsible for 
the update and ensuring that our ELL's are assessed in their home language.   
 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             64 

 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

All SIFE students are appropriately placed in ENL classes and are offered AIS services. All SIFE students receive ENL for 
extended time, registered for after-school program, receives a mentor and counseling. Work is differentiated for SIFE students 
using multiple supplemental resources in the classrooms such as leveled libraries, Wilson reading program and Great Leaps 
reading program. In addition, web based instruction and listening centers are in place for multi-sensory learning. 
 All newcomers less than three years are registered for an academic intervention service to assist in conversational language.   
Newcomers are especially engaged in listening centers and are grouped with native English speaker at time to practice 
oral language skills. Students are given word-to-word dictionaries and receive 8 units of ENL classes.  Students participate in 
after-school activities s for additional hep.  . In addition, newcomers are immediately scheduled to receive Math Plato (Web 
based program) to strengthen and grasp mathematical skills. 
ELLs 4-6 years will continue to receive the mandated amount of periods in ENL.  The work is crafted from the ELA curriculum 
and is supported with the teacher during the classes.  ELLs 4-6 years will continue to receive small group instruction in  Math 
which is tailored to meet the needs of each student.  Students who are 4-6 years are placed in extended day classes and are 
assigned  
content specialist to work with them; these students are also placed in after-school programs geared to inprove student 
reading proficiency levels.  They are administered a pre-test, interim tests and post test to reflect understanding and growth in 
all AIS and classes. 
 All long-term ELLs and former ELLs will continue to receive all services if deemed appropriate. Long term ELLs will  
receive intense services using Title III funding for the 2015-2016 school year using the book Getting Ready for The 
NYSESLAT/ Visions/ Journey in Reading.  Instruction will focus on reading and writing. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs identified as having disabilities or special needs receive their mandated ESL services and all other services 
andaccommodations that are dictated in their IEP. ESL teachers are familiar with the student’s IEP and are aware of the special 
needs of each ELL. ESL teachers articulate often with the classroom teacher to find out what instructional materials are helpful 
and what is and isn’t working inside the student’s classroom. ESL teachers are used to asking classroom teachers to adapt and 
scaffold content to the  
language needs of their ELLs. Here the ESL teacher must also adapt and scaffold based on the student’s particular individual 
needs.  
The ESL teachers work closely with these Special Ed teachers to provide suitable individualized language instruction using 
many visual aids, role playing, cooperative project tasks, appropriate reading comprehension activities etc… The ESL teacher 
assists to make the materials ELL friendly depending on the individual language needs of the student and the Special Ed 
provider assists the ESL teacher to ensure the content area materials are appropriate for the student’s disability, learning 
styles, and grade level.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Van Siclen Community Middle School uses a Project Based Curriculum in all content areas which is inclusive of differentiated 
instruction to meet the needs of ELL-SWDs. Additionally, Springboard APIP curriculum is now infused in some ELA and Math 
classes as a part of our inquiry work. Flexibility of scheduling is reflected with the pull-out small group instruction.  Our ESL 
teacher is programmed to use professional assignment times to work with ELL-SWDs for intensive instruction and language 
development.   
 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             65 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Children receive the appropriate allocated number of periods for ESL services based on State mandates.  Beginners and 
intermediate students receive two units of ESL which equals 8 periods per week.  Advanced students receive one unit of ESL, 
equaling 4 periods per week.  Students receive instruction in English.  All monolingual classes, which include special education 
students, use homogeneous grouping according to LAB and NYSELAT results. Children are exposed to a literary environment, 
which encompasses reading, writing, listening, speaking, the arts, and classroom libraries.  Instructional strategies include The 
Balanced Literacy Approach to reading (which emphasizes the writing process), the math workshop model, and The Language 
Experience Approach.  To meet higher standards, students will read 25 appropriate leveled books by the end of the school 
year, thus exposing them to various genres.  They will respond in writing, art, multi-media and oral presentations.  Teaching 
strategies will address and incorporate Webb's Depth of Knowledge/Bloom’s Taxonomy, designing coherent instruction, 
establishing a culture for learning, engaging students in learning, rubrics, problem solving, higher order thinking skills and 
portfolio assessment.  Students self-evaluate (using reflection papers and peer conferencing) and are monitored and evaluated 
on an ongoing basis by their classroom teachers.  Using the Common Core Standards, literacy across the content areas 
in  Science and Social Studies through project based learning and exit projects will address multi-sensory and abilities in 
meeting students needs and standards. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We have extended our academic school day to 5 p.m. to allow our Ell's more time on task and to strengthen their English 
Language.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

none   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs have access to the same after school and supplemental services offered to our general education population.  They 
participate in a range of programs from violin to Myon, Achieve 3000, ELA and Math Intensive after school programs, Math 
Excel and Write to Learn.  Letters sent home for after school support are translated by our Community Assistant.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials to support ELLs include the following: Web based programs-Mathspace, Achieve 3000, Write to 
Learn and Math Excel.      
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All instruction is conducted in English as part of the Freestanding ENL program but the students do receive some forms of 
native language support. New beginning level ELL students are initially paired with students from their native language (if 
available) group to help them feel comfortable and translate some of the details if necessary. Many of the students are 
introduced to members of the multi-lingual translation team (made up of teachers, paras, family workers, administrators, and 
the parent coordinator) so they will know an adult in the building they can speak with in their home language. All ELLs literate 
in their native language are given the DOE downloadable translated glossaries in math, science and social studies. In addition, 
classroom libraries have books in the students’ home language and word-to-word translated dictionaries. The school 
purchased large numbers of  
bilingual/word-by-word dictionaries/glossaries in the languages represented by the students in the school. Students literate in 
their native language may also use word-to-word translated dictionaries/glossaries or translated exams on certain state exams. 
Also, some classroom teachers allow new ELLs to use word-to-word glossaries/dictionaries on some content area classroom 
exams.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             66 

 

 

ESL class required support and resources are all judged form formative assessments such as DRA's, LAB-R and NYSESLAT 
results. They are used to determine the student's reading levels.  Once their reading levels are acquired, additional resources 
such as word-to-word dictionaries and classroom libraries are purchased to meet and address the grade level and age of the 
students.  However, there are cases that will provide discrepancies between the age and grade level of students.  In these 
cases, these students are pulled for small group instruction and are supplied with the appropriate resources to build and 
promote student learning.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The instructional materials to support ELLs include the following: Web based programs-Mathspace, Achieve 3000, Write to 
Learn and Math Excel.      
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our ELL students are afforded the same opportunities as our general education student to prepare them to assimilate into the 
culture of our school.  All new admit student attend a summer bridge program in August (1 week) whereas they get to meet 
their new teachers, and are exposed to the curriculum and culture of our school.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our 8  th   grade students are required to take Spanish.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our professional  development plan will focus on academic language acquisition for our ELLs.   
The literacy, ESL and  Sped teachers as well as support from our borough liaison teaching Standards, and other areas as 
ascertained from teachers’ individual needs assessment surveys.  In addition, the ESL department will be studying components 
3c: engaging student learning, 2b: establishing a culture for learning and 1e: designing coherent instruction.  The goal of our 
professional development is to provide instructional support to our teachers in order to refine their pedagogical skills and 
improve student performance.  Our professional development activities are designed to enhance our teachers’ ability to 
understand and use curricula, assessment measures and instructional strategies for LEP students.  
 During professional development, teachers practice using rubrics to evaluate student work and provide constructive feedback, 
analyze assessment data to  inform and modify instruction, discuss and implement exemplary research based  practices, 
arrange intra-visitation for teachers to observe effective instruction  and classroom management, and  review and 
development strategic analysis of  student performance.  
 Professional development will be offered during the school year for all ESL teachers through our school network 
affiliates.   Teachers  can register for off-site pd. Classroom support will be provided by school mentors, lead teachers and 
intra-visitations.  This will support the implementation of the methodologies proposed at training sessions.   
Trainings for the 7.5 hours will emphasize scaffolding as an instructional strategy and the integration of language and literacy

in academic content, as well as looking at data.  The focus is on how to accelerate academic achievement and English language 
development for secondary English Language Learners through understanding academic language.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  We ensure that our ENL teacher meets the 50% requirement ELL specific professional development by hiring an ENL coach 
from Generation Ready and ensuring that we fund her attendance at the day long UFT ELL Conference.  Our teacher also 
attend borough supported ELL training. 
Our staff receives documented professional development with an emphasis on scaffolding as an instructional strategy and the 
integration of language and literacy in academic content, as well as looking at data.  The focus is on how to accelerate 
academic achievement and English language development for secondary English Language Learners through understanding 
academic language.  Kiesha Kemp (AP) is  
responsible for keeping all records of professional development including attendance and agendas.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We meet with the parents of our ELLs formally 3 times per year-September, November and February whereas we discuss their 
child's progress not only in each curricula area but their English language proficiency levels as well.  Teachers are also available 
to meet with parents each Tuesday during their parent engagement hour.  We have several staff members who speak our 
predominate language that are available for translation.  However if needed we also have access to a language interpretation 
unit if needed. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At Van Siclen Community Middle School we recognize that families and other community members are a vital part of all 
students’ academic and social success, and consider family involvement an essential ingredient for a successful educational 
program.  Our parents are involved within the community and volunteer in conjunction with our parent coordinator to hold 
varied events in keeping the school community informed.   We have an active Family Room with a parent coordinator to 
facilitate all activities and resources that help towards a school-wide focus on strengthening home-school relationships and 
increasing parent and community involvement.  To support parent involvement efforts, a parent coordinator will continue to 
work with parents and  students during the 2015-2016 school year.  Parents volunteer to go on trips hosted through the library 
events such as RIF, community health fairs and a wealth of school based activities.  There is an annual Literacy Family Night 
done in the winter where parents of ELLs and all students attend which incorporate new and upcoming author's session, art, 
health and nutrition.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Adonna Mcfarland, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Van Siclen Community Middle school serves a community with 13% of our parents and students who speak a 
language other than English at home (Spanish/Arabic). These are some of the measures that are currently in place 
to identify translation/interpretation needs: 

Formal Indicators: 

Blue cards: Every child in the school has a blue card on file filled out by their parents/guardians. The blue card has 
a specific section where the parents must specify their preferred written and oral language of communication. 
The parents receive these cards initially at their child’s registration and during the first week of every September 
when classroom teachers hand out the cards to all students in their classes. All completed blue cards are sent 
down to the office which compiles and continuously updates the data into the computer system. This allows the 
school and individual teachers to know the exact translation needs of our school community. 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             72 

 

Home Language Information Surveys: Every child in the school must have a HLIS. They are given to every new 
student at registration and 

must be filled out by their parents/guardians. The HLIS are given to the parent/guardian in English and in the 
appropriate home language. 

Like the blue cards, there is a section on the HLIS asking the parent to state their preferred written and oral 
language of communication. If a student transfers into the school from an existing NYC school, the HLIS is sent 
from the prior school and is examined upon arrival. 

Informal indicators: 

As in any school environment, there are times when teachers end up speaking or meeting with older siblings, 
aunts and uncles, grandparents, etc…. The blue card or HLIS might indicate the parent/guardian’s preferred 
language of communication but the person, for instance a relative, who the teacher is speaking with might have a 
different preferred language. Teachers, administrators, and office staff often have to informally speak with 
(sometimes with the help of a translator) the students and parents to find out if there are any additional 

translation needs that are not mentioned on the blue cards or HLIS. In addition, at the beginning of every school 
year. 

 
Using these formal and informal methods, the school and each individual teacher has an accurate account of the 
preferred language of communication of the students and their families. 
  

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

How do you plan to translate? Include 
procedures to ensure timely provision 
of translated documents to parents.  

To facilitate parental involvement with 
the school, support their child’s 
education, and to ensure non-English 
speaking parents are as informed as 
English-speaking parents, Van Siclen 
Community Middle School has a 
number of established procedures in 
place. We have an existing multilingual 
in-house team to provide written 
translation and interpretation services. 
VSC makes use of existing written DOE 
translated documents that can be 
ordered or downloaded. All DOE 
provided parent translation letters are 
utilized by the school. If DOE provided 
translated documents are not available 
for a particular situation, in accordance 
with Chancellor's Regulation A-663, the 
team 

consisting of staff members will do the 
following: 

(If services cannot be provided in-house 
then the school will use the NYCDOE 
translation unit, parent volunteers, 
translators 

from other schools within the district, 
or outside vendors.)

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of an emergency and if there is no in house staff member who speaks a needed home language- we will 
then call the DOE T and I unit for immediate over the phone interpretation. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

At our August Staff meeting all staff are introduced to our Language Access Coordinator who then provides them with 
a copy of the Language Guide ID and the number to the DOE Translation and Interpretation unit if they need 
immediate over the phone interpretation. 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any:

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

Van Siclen Community Middle School follows the regulations and guidelines within Section VII of Chancellor’s 
Regulations A-663. Actions and policies pertaining to the Chancellor’s regulations have already been described in 
previous parts of sections A and B of this plan. There is also a sign in, Spanish, in front of the main office informing 
parents that translation services are available at their request. There is also a Language ID card posted where visitors 
have easy access. 

As described earlier, measures and policies are in place at the beginning of every school year to learn and document 
the preferred language of communication of every child in the school and every parent/guardian of that child. 
Measures are also in place to learn the specific communication needs of other family members the school/teacher 
may have contact with. As described earlier, measures and policies are in place governing written and oral 
translations/interpretations. In addition, in accordance with A-663, parents/guardians are notified and given access to 
the Parent Bill of Rights and Responsibilities. Provisions are made within the school safety plan to address the 
communication needs of parents. As described earlier, the school has purchased a multilingual school message 
program. Every classroom teacher is expected to have a list of translation needs to ensure all needs are addressed 
both in the classroom level and at home. Van Siclen Community Middle School will continue to strive to remove 
communication barriers between the school, teachers, and parents.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our primary method of feedback is to use our "School effectiveness survey" given to parents twice a year to gauge the 
effectiveness and availability of all services.
