Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8

School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you

monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title 

I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Mission Statement : 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

At PS/MS 183 our purpose is to support each child to develop personally and academically as a thinking being and a 
global citizen. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S./M.S. 183 is a learning community that is anchored in relationship-building and the evolution of a shared purpose 
under the auspices of a newly assigned leader. Our school is a learning institution that spans generations of learners. 
We serve children in grades 3K though grade eight. We have sustained a partnership with District 79 and provide GED 
as well as English as a Second Language courses for adult learners in the local community.  We are vested in creating a 
safe and supportive school culture, which promotes academic risk-taking by learners and teachers. We are dedicated 
to encouraging diverse learners to become self-directed through inquiry and exploration. Our special initiatives 
include Middle School departmentalization, Thinking Maps and a Science-Technology-Engineering-Arts-Mathematics 
centered (STEAM-centric) culture. Our shared commitment to excellence in tandem with central office is the fruition 
of initiatives such as College Access for All, Algebra for All and Universal Literacy. With equity as a priority, we have 
leveraged local and broader community resources in order to replace the student furniture dated 1961 and upgrade 
the learning environment.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our student population is characterized with the largest proportion of students with disabilities amongst all schools 
located in the Queens South NYCDOE Borough Office (Queens South). The specific needs of our students who are 
'differently-abled' is to ensure that they have access to the curriculum and opportunities in order to progress as 
learners. Based on the students' documented individual needs and specific classroom groupings, we have one or more 
ICT classes in grades Kindergarten through Grade 8, a self-contained class in 5 of these 9 grades and support services. 
A significant proportion of our students are identified as English language learners (ELLs). The specific need of this 
special student population is to promote the development of English proficiency across the tiers between Entering to 
Expanding/Commanding. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The school has made the most progress in the area of Supportive Environment. Effective August 2018, the School 
Violence Index (SVI) was below the NYSED SVI threshold and the school met the requirements to have the designation 
of Potentially Persistently Dangerous removed for the 2017-18 school year.  

The area of focus is Rigorous Instruction specifically in reading across the content areas. The student performance in 
grades 3-8 on the NYSED State tests indicated an increase in student performance at proficient or above levels in 
English Language Arts (ELA) in 2016-17 (14%) compared to 2017-18 (24.7%) and an increase in Math in 2016-17 
(10%)compared to 2017-18 (21.7%). The special needs population evidenced an increase in student performance at 
proficient or above levels in ELA in 2016-17 (4%) compared to 2017-18 (12%). The results indicated that closing the 
achievement gap for different groups of students is a challenge. The results evidenced that progress must be made in

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Mid-Year target: By February 2019, there will be an increase of 3% of students reading at proficiency levels in Grades 
K-2 as measured by Fountas & Pinnell and in Grades 3-8 as measured by Ready NY ELA 1st round simulation 

Mid-year assessment highlights as of February 2019: 

In grades K-2 there is an increase of 9% of students who have met the specific targets in Fountas & Pinnell. This 
surpasses the mid-year goal of 3% as set forth in the S/CEP.  

Using the Ready NY ELA as a predictor to the NYS ELA, the Ready NY ELA Round I simulation data indicates that 32% 
of students, in grades 3-8 are proficient and the NYS ELA 2017-18 was 24.7%. This surpasses the 3% target as set forth 
in the S/CEP.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

The school's strength is the number of incidents below the School Violence Index (SVI) during the 2017-18 school year 
resulting in removal from the Potentially Persistently Dangerous list for the 2017-18 school year as determined by the 
New York State Education Department.  

The priority need is to foster students' self-regulation of communication skills as it relates to thinking, expression of self 
and peer collaboration. The priority need is identified from the data patterns and trends in the 2017-18 School Quality 
Guide. The survey measures related to student ownership of their own learning include : 

  67% of teachers say that students build on each others ideas during class discussions 
  61% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes provide constructive feedback to their 

peers/teachers  

  76% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes participate in class discussions at 

some point  

  42% of students say that most students say that most students behave well even when the teacher isn't 

watching 

  43% of students say that most students at their school treat each other with respect

after 8 a.m. ), physical health (a Physical Education Department with 3 movement teachers 3K-Grade 8), social-
emotional (Sanford Harmony daily 1/2 hour morning meeting school-wide), academic (a uniform grading policy 
designed through the input of all teachers) and a culture that promotes long-term development as a 3K through 
adulthood (we have two 3K classes and and adult GED program).

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Mid-Year target: By February 2019, 50% of students will use thinking maps and increase the frequency of student-led 
conversations integrated into daily lessons.  

Mid-year assessment highlights as of February, 2019: 

The school community was introduced to Thinking Maps October-December. The school officially launched the 
Thinking Maps 12-week exploratory roll-out phase in January. 

A Thinking Maps Mid-Year Assessment survey designed by Thinking Maps, Inc. @2017 was distributed to teachers in 
February. The results indicate that 100% of teachers who submitted the survey either Strongly Agree, Agree or 
Somewhat agree that- 

  Question 1 ‘All of my students have been introduced to Thinking Maps’  

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             22 

 

  Question 6 ‘Thinking Maps support interactive and engaged learning in my classroom’ and  

99% either Strongly Agree, Agree or Somewhat agree that: 

  Question 2- 'Students are motivated to learn when they use Thinking Maps' 
  Question 3- 'The Thinking Maps have helped students to organize their ideas’  

As of February, 2019 based on the ADVANCE tool, 75% of Measures of Teacher Practice (MOTP) observations are 
completed. Based on the ADVANCE tool grounded in the Danielson Framework for Teaching (DFfT) component 3b 
Questioning & Discussions, the data evidences the following: 

Oct-December 44.44% of teachers were rated Effective or Highly Effective in 3b  

Dec-Feb 63.6% of teachers (an increase of 19.2%) rated Effective or Highly Effective in 3b 

 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
Student notebooks and portfolios will include projects anchored in the use of visual tools to organize their thinking 

 

Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Mid-Year Target: By February 2019 create departments, realize school vision and administer an in-house survey 

February 2019 Mid-Year Assessment highlights: 

The evidence that supports our likelihood of meeting the targets set forth in the S/CEP is the evolution of 
departments’ grades 5-8 to include ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies and Physical Education this school year. The 
school vision to engage students and adults as thinkers is channeled through the Thinking Maps initiative. The school 
community was introduced to Thinking Maps October-December. The school officially launched the Thinking Maps 
12-week exploratory roll-out phase in January. Teachers and paraprofessionals engaged in Monday P.D. sessions as a 
cohesive unit on January 14 and January 28. A Thinking Maps Mid-Year Assessment survey designed by Thinking 
Maps, Inc. @2017 was distributed to teachers in February. The results indicate that:  

100% of teachers who submitted the survey either Strongly Agree, Agree or Somewhat agree that-  

  Question 9- 'Our school should continue to focus on Thinking Maps in our professional development' , and

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, 
Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be 
SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, students that participate in Extended Learning Time and have an attendance rate of 75% or greater will 
show an increase of reading proficiency as measured by Fountas & Pinnell and the Ready NY ELA 2nd round 
simulation

At least 50 % of eligible students (Levels 1 and 2 on the NYS ELA) will attend the ELT program to be conducted after-
school and during the recess periods. Enrichment activities will be in conjunction with the Mayoral Middle School 
Initiative, SONYC program. Students will be encouraged to participate through targeted recruitment efforts such as 
parent notifications, one-to-one sessions and follow-up phone calls Similarly, attendance with be tracked and 
simultaneously encouraged.  

 

 
Part 3 – ELT Program Description  

The ELT program will be offered to all students eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS), with the goal of 
serving a minimum of fifty percent of AIS-eligible students. 
Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School: 
 

Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning 
relevant and engaging. 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to 

promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of 

a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area. 

  Engage in outreach activities made to families. 

  Academics will be offered by certified teachers from PS 183 and the enrichment will be offered by the SONYC 
program. Our instructional program will target the ELA and Math power standards and the skill development 
of students relative to these standards.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             48 

 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

PS/MS 183 Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in our school. Therefore, our school, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between our school and the families. Our school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. 

 

 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will: 

 

 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS/MS 183 School-Parent Compact 

Our school, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act, is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards and Assessments. 

1.  Statement of Parent Policy 

P.S. 183 Q 

Dr. Richard R. Green School 

 

P.S./M.S. 183Q is committed to developing and implementing a parent policy that fosters a partnership between the 
home, school and community. We have identified six key areas that contribute to a partnership that supports greater 
student achievement. 

 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             54 

  The school will join parents in providing for the health and safety of our children, and in the maintenance of a 
home environment that encourages learning and positive behavior in schools. The school will provide training 
and information to help families understand their children’s development and how to support the changes 
the children undergo. 

  The school will reach out to provide parents and provide them with information about school programs and 
student progress. This will include phone calls, report cards, parent conferences, as well as new information 
on topics like school choice. Communication will be in a form that families find understandable and useful. 

  Parents can make a significant contribution to the environment and functioning of our school. Our school will 
encourage parent volunteers and make every effort to match the experience and talents of our parents to the 
needs of the school. 

  With the guidance and support of the school, family members can assist their children with homework and 

other school related activities. Our school will encourage parents to join in learning activities at home (library 
cards, home reading corner, Parent Association (PA), Parent Advisory Council (PAC), resource centers, book 
sales, following directions, reading recipes, etc.) 

  The school will work to assist parents in having meaningful roles in the school decision-making process. The 

school will provide parents with training and information so they can make the most of this opportunity. 

  The school will help parents gain access to support services by other agencies, such as health care, Academic 

Intervention Services (AIS), and childcare programs. 

  Parents will be encouraged to attend PA and PAC meetings that will be held at times that are convenient for 
parents. A rotational schedule of PA meetings will be developed in coordination with the PA executives and 
the school in order to accommodate parents that cannot attend evening meetings only. When necessary, 
translators will be available, so those parents will understand all of the proceedings at PA meetings. 
Additional accommodations will be made for parents with disabilities so that they too can attend meetings. 

  Through the efforts of the Parent Coordinator, the PA President with District support, an outreach will be 

made to parents of students in temporary housing (STH) so that these families will be involved in all 
parent/school activities. Parents will be invited to attend culminating celebrations. 
Student of the month celebrations will be held in conjunction with PA meetings 

 
  Perfect Attendance 
 

School publications (i.e. pamphlets, newsletters, and letters to parents) will be used to apprise parents of 
important upcoming events including testing dates, school events and open school. 

  The school calendar will be disseminated each month to parents 
  Weekdays- GED Classes and Computer workshops will be held for parents and notified of any changes during 

the month. 

  At an Open House, the parents of English Language Learners/Limited English Proficiency (ENL/LEP) students 
will receive an orientation session on state standards assessment program, school expectations and general 
program requirements for bilingual education and/or free standing ENL programs. 

 

 

Parent workshops will focus on basic educational concerns, health care, and financial planning and parenting skills. 

 

Professional Development: 

Hold monthly professional development for parents, which is provided by the Parent Coordinator. This professional 
development will focus on school life for students, curriculum standards, assessments, and health and medical issues 
for families.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school utilizes various assessments to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs. We use Fountas and Pinnell, Wilson 
Fundations, Common Core Benchmarks,Go Math, Myon, CodeX, Teacher's College Writing, and teacher- made assessments to 
assess, track, and monitor students' progress.   Additionally, literacy skills are further assessed through the NYSESLAT, 
NYSITELL, and Spanish LAB. The ENL teacher shares these results through initial and ongoing conferencing with teachers.  The 
data provides us with the insight that ELLs who are proficient in their home language seem to progress more quickly than 
those ELLs who have poor home language proficient skills.  The results are used to drive and differentiate instruction  based on 
students' needs.  Teachers meet to analyze data and plan future instruction.  The data helps them plan for RTI tiers of learning 
and/or instruction.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             60 

 

 

The teachers have common preps to share data from the assessments and design instruction to meet the needs of their 
students. The ENL teachers are invited to meet with the teachers during those preps to help modify and develop the planning 
that will be used to address the areas the ELLs are have difficulty with. Also teachers share their curriculum maps and plans 
through Rubicon. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
This section was intentionally left blank and will be completed in September when the State releases the test scores.           
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Students are discussed during RTI meetings and cabinet meetings.  The teams meet with teachers during Monday professional 
development and Tuesdays.    
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Teachers are constantly assessing students and using the results to plan future lessons and groups.  Our school uses four 
assessment types for tier 1 RTI, formative, screening, outcome, and test prep; they are aligned with day to day instruction. 
Data is collected and data is analyzed to plan further instruction.   
RTI for ELLs (k-5) For Tier 1, Classroom teachers set high but reasonable instructional expectations that provide ongoing 
instructional support to ensure that these expectations are met. This promotes language and vocabulary development 
throughout the day. For Tier 2, AIS teachers ensure that interventions are sufficiently intense in small groups (2-5 students) 
who are provided intervention for a minimum of 30 minutes each day. For Tier 3, AIS teachers of ELLs would provide highly 
intensive and extensive reading interventions that start immediately (as early as 1st grade). Tier 3 intervention will continue as 
needed. The results of the various assessments including: Fountas and Pinnell,Common Core aligned assessments,Teachers 
College Writing  assessments, Performance-Based Assessments, End of Unit Assessments, NYSESLAT, and teacher-made 
assessments are used for planning, grouping, differentiation, and providing targeted interventions. Intervention is provided 
throughout the year and based on the needs of the student.            
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 A review of the 2016 NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data indicates the following: 
In grades K - 3, the majority of our ELLs (58%) scored at the Transitioning Level or better. In grades 4-8,  most of our students 
are at the Expanding. All ELL students in grades K thru 8 scored lowest in the writing subtest.  Therefore, the implementation 
of Ready Gen, Wilson Fundations, Teacher's College Writing Program, and Code X,  will play a huge part in developing our ELLs' 
writing and overall skills. 
   The focus for these learners is the integration of reading and writing into activities which call upon the listening and speaking 
skills.    
We can also see that out of 22 students, 11 students moved up one level or more on the NYSESLAT. The increase of students 
scoring at the Expanding level reflect the targeted instruction received previously.     A focus on vocabulary development and 
reading comprehension is being used to continue student growth.   
   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL teachers meet with grade teams to review the data and develop strategies to implement in the classes. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             61 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The Freestanding (ENL) programs provide instruction in English with home language support, emphasizing English 
language acquisition. The ENL program is designed to support ELLs in second language development.   It will consist of 
two instructional models as per CR Part 154-2: 
  
*Stand-alone ENL will develop English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. It will be 
delivered by Ms. Mossen and Mrs. McDonald, our two certified ENL teachers. The students are involved in learning 
focused on language acquisition techniques that will further enable them to meet competency when they are in their 
classroom.  Specific attention is given to writing and vocabulary development. 
  
*Integrated ENL will build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered by a co teaching 
model.  Instruction includes content area subject matter and English language development using ENL strategies. All 
ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting ELL status will receive 90 minutes of instruction weekly. Our ENL 
teachers works with ELLs in collaboration with general education classroom teachers to provide language acquisition 
and vocabulary support. Common preparation time is scheduled so that ENL teachers and classroom teachers can 
collaboratively plan lessons. 
  
The number of ENL instructional units are dependent upon their score on the NYSITELL or the NYSESLAT and what 
level they have achieved as required by CR Part 154.2 Regulations. All ELLs and former ELLs up to 2 years after exiting 
ELL status will receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL. 
  
Our ENL teachers use the curriculum and modify the skills in order to make the content understandable for 
ELLs.    Language and content are taught cohesively.  Lessons are developed to include language objectives in every 
content lesson.            

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Explicit ENL and ELA instructional minutes are provided through an integrated model and stand-alone model.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   In compliance with ENL related mandates, Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 360 minutes of instruction from the ENL 
teachers. The ENL teachers provide  Transitioning and Expanding ELLs with 180 minutes of instruction weekly.  Commanding 
students are mandated to receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction each week. 
  
         Instruction is provided throughout the school in English, however, there are textbooks available in the home language of 
Spanish in the content areas of Math, Social Studies and ELA. Additionally, there are glossaries available online for the students 
in Math and Science in Russian, Spanish and Chinese. Translation dictionaries are also available in Urdu, Chinese, Spanish and 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             62 

 

Amharic. Libraries of National Geographic in Spanish and English are used by Ms. Mossen and Ms. McDonald to support the 
content areas of Social Studies and Science. Also available is a listening library in Chinese focusing on the content area of ELA. 
A variety of non-fiction books addressing such topics as Health; Science and Social Studies, in addition to fiction for grades K-3, 
are available in the school library for all to use. Content area performance data indicate that ELLs have made improvement. 
Several students have moved from low-level 2’s to high – level2’s. 
 
The teachers use various assessments to drive instruction.  
        The following instructional approaches and methods, aligned with CCLS are emphasized:  
        *Use of rubrics for student self assessments, listening and speaking activities in ENL, ELA, etc. to allow for accountable 
talk,  
        *Use of graphic organizers, glossaries in HL, and explicit vocabulary instruction, to allow for students to comprehend 
challenging information.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   The Spanish Lab is used to evaluate student's home language literacy skills.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

         Instruction is differentiated according to NYSESLAT score and grade level, as well as by individual student need as 
measured by writing samples and general assessments taken on a regular basis. Input is also sought from the student’s 
classroom teachers to further tailor the class to students’ needs. Focus of the program is an improvement of academic English 
skills in an effort to aid students with their overall academic work and preparation for the NYSESLAT.  
  
        Based on the results of their NYSITELL assessments, newcomers to the English Language School System will receive their 
mandated ENL services. Small group or individual instruction will focus on their immediate needs to facilitate a smooth 
transition.In addition, classroom teachers will provide support to the newcomers by placing them in groups with native English 
language speakers as well as students who share the home language as the newcomers, and by providing dictionaries, 
glossaries and books in the home languages. Students will participate in small group, task-oriented situations that guide the 
production of language both in verbal and written form. Students’ seating arrangements will enable them to clearly see and 
hear the teacher during instruction.  
Plan for SIFE students  
         After the SIFE student has been identified by LENS (if applicable), both ENL teachers in conjunction with the classroom 
teachers will make assessments of the student to determine the areas of need. Materials will then be given to supplement as 
needed. During weekly Team meetings the ENL teachers will review that student's progress with the classroom teacher, and 
cluster teachers. The discussion of the SIFE student (s) will occur weekly where we will address effectiveness of additional 
support/materials given.  
  
        Our school will also continue the buddy system for SIFE students by pairing them with advanced or former ELLs who speak 
their home language. In conjunction with our school librarian, SETSS teacher, and ENL teacher will make lower level texts 
available to teachers of SIFE to complement grade level texts. As with all ELLs, AIS and after school tutoring are additional 
services that are available for SIFE students.  
Differentiated Instruction Plan for SIFEs and Newcomers  
The instructional plan for SIFE and Newcomers (Including those who will be tested in ELA after one year) includes:  
1. Activating prior knowledge: word associations, word splash relationships, KWL charts, and anticipation guides.  
2. Providing a print rich environment: maps, charts, signs, posters with motivational phrases, the alphabet in print and script, 
the Pledge of Allegiance, etc., lower-grade texts, texts that are written for a lower reading level, high interest, low ability 
books, native language materials, and bilingual glossaries.  

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             63 

 

3. Engaging students in hands-on learning:  
4. Introducing new vocabulary, new concepts: rephrasing, defining in context, and simplifying, using intonation and pauses for 
emphasis.  
5. Providing multiple opportunities to demonstrate understanding: explanations, acting out, discussing, defending, 
drawing,etc.  
6. Allowing students to work in cooperative groups.  
7. When possible, building the native language content and literacy instruction in order to build on English.  
8. Using teaching strategies that weave together language and content instruction, such as the SIOP model (Sheltered 
Instruction Observation Protocol).  
  
Plan for ELLs in school 4-6 years:  
        Our ENL teachers use 
 
 scaffolding, realia, and other ENL methodologies . With these approaches the students will develop interpersonal 
communication skills (the connection between form and structure for English, and their social-functional meaning; develop the 
ability to use language by actively employing the students’ information processing capabilities required to acquire academic 
language skills  
 
Plans for ELLs in school 6 years completed or more/ Long term ELLs  
         Long term ELLs will continue to receive their mandated ESL services and or ELA instruction as required under CR Part 154-
2. Additionally, long-term ELLs will receive small group instruction provided by AIS teachers. The Extended Day Program will 
provide an additional service to long-term ELLs.  
Testing Accommodations for former ELLs are extended for two years after they obtain proficiency. The accommodations are 
for NYS ELA and Content-area assessments include:  
• Time Extension (all exams)  
• Separate Location (all exams)  
• Bilingual Dictionaries and/or Glossaries  
• Simultaneous use of English and Alternative Language Editions (not for ELA Exam)  
* Oral Translation for Low Incidence Languages (not for ELA exam)  
• Writing Responses in the Home Language (not for ELA Exam)   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
          At PS/MS 183Q teachers of Ell-SWDs use Fundations, Passport, Ready Gen,  Code X (6-8), Go Math, and Engage NY to 
design instruction to meet the needs of their students . Some of the  programs include an ELL-SWD intervention component, 
which classroom teachers and the ENL teacher implement.  The curriculum provides extra ELL support kits and instruction that 
promote language development. All teachers have access to SESIS. They review student's IEPs and arrange schedules and 
programs accordingly to meet all mandates on IEP. Whenever necessary, student is provided with a bilingual instructor and/or 
paraprofessional.       The certified ENL teacher for grades K-8, utilizes a variety of instructional techniques, strategies, and ENL 
methodologies to enhance the academic performance of English Language Learners.  The instructional techniques employed 
during instruction include modeling, scaffolding, bridging, contextualization, schema building, text representation, and 
metacognitive development.  Through a thematic approach to teaching students are taught the four modalities of language: 
reading, writing, speaking, and listening; using the aforementioned instructional techniques.  During the thematic approach to 
instruction the five ESL approaches are employed.  They include Cooperative Learning, The Natural Approach, The Language 
Experience Approach, Total Physical Response, and the Whole Language Approach.  For students at the Emerging language 
level, instruction focuses on Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills (BICS).  As students reach the Transitioning- Expanding 
Levels of language, the focus shifts towards Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP).    
  
         For those students with Special needs, the goals stated on their IEPs are taken into consideration as well as their need as 
indicated by their NYSESLAT or NYSITELL scores. They will continue to receive their mandated ENL services plus additional 
support that will be provided through AIS, Related Services, and After School Tutoring .  

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             64 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
        Through flexible programming, ELL-SWDs are allowed to sit in a general education class when they show strength in ELA 
and Math for 2 periods a day. Additionally, these students participate in a mainstream classroom during tutoring, ELL services, 
and related services. We have ICT classes for Grades K-5 and 7-8 where ELL-SWDs may integrate with high performing general 
education students. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA include EngageNY, Wilson Fundations, Wilson, and Voyager. Additionally, 
interventions are provided using ReadyGEN and CodeX, which are reading programs for students in grade K-5 and 6-8, 
respectively.  Interventions center on literacy instruction, read-alouds, whole class directed lessons, independent practice, 
learning center activities,  vocabulary development, phonics, etc.   For targeted intervention in math we use Go Math, 
EngageNY, and Connected Math.    
  
Targeted Academic intervention Services are provided to students daily and during the after school tutoring program. ELLs are 
offered academic intervention services in English with home language support as follows:  
1.Small group instruction provided by AIS teacher in all content areas  
2.Extended learning time (ELT) is available to all ELL students Grades K-8 focusing on math and ELA. 
3. Title III F-Status teacher provides additional small group AIS services to Transitional ELLs.

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL students receive equity and access to all programs and are provided with the opportunity to participate in the ELT 
program. They are also scheduled for AIS as are all students at PS/MS 183Q. ELLs are afforded the same eligibility to participate 
in after school programs and clubs  as other students.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
PS/MS 183 utilizes instructional materials that includes both text and technology. Students use a variety of materials to 
support teaching and learning in themes and content specific activities.  
We have used and will continue to use Title III funding to support the learning of ELLs. The following materials were 
purchased:  
1. Listening Center- Books with tapes, tape recorders and headphones (available in English, Spanish and Chinese)  
2. Library Books (English, Spanish, Chinese and Urdu)  
3. Knowledge Industries Multicultural Book Sets (K-3, 4-8)  
4. NYSESLAT Practice materials  
5. Dictionaries (Spanish, French, Chinese, Urdu and Amharic) 
6. Myon 
We will purchase additional support materials in Russian and Arabic with Title III funds in order to support our ELLs.  
Technology is a major support and resource used within the school. The technology lab is available to all ELL students in 
addition to the fact that every classroom is equipped with either PC’s or laptops.  
In addition to the materials listed above, students use the following in the various content areas:

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home Language Support is given in the form of peer-interaction , as well as by the use of bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, use 
of the internet and texts in Spanish, Russian, Arabic and Chinese whenever needed. Bilingual glossaries for Social Studies, 
Math, and Science are available in the classrooms. Students may also use Google translate when necessary. Peers who speak 
the ELLs HL are "buddied" to give assistance.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
All ENL students have the support of their teachers, administration, the parent coordinator, Ms. Stillwell, two guidance 
counselors, Ms.Peykarian and Mr. Feliciano, and staff members. The guidance counselor assists our middle school ELLs with 
middle school and high school requirements.  
Support service providers work with ELLs using age and grade appropriate materials. Our staff works together in grade teams 
to plan how to address the deficiencies of each student whether it involves using grade appropriate scaffolds, computer 
programs (Starfall.com or Brainpop.com), or NYS Bilingual Glossaries for elementary and middle school. 
 The ENL teachers turn key information from the professional developments they attend to the teachers so they can 
implement the strategies in their lessons.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development Professional Development and Support for School Staff, including parent coordinators and school 
secretaries . These PDs will provide teachers of ELLs with the tools needed to plan effectively, provide vigorous instruction, 
support and scaffold, and meet the language needs of students as they engage in the CCLS.  
All staff have the support of school leadership and the two guidance counselors, Ms. Peykarian and Mr. Feliciano. Mr. Feliciano 
assists our middle school ELLs with middle school and high school requirements. Both counselors provide crisis intervention 
and mediation. They receive PD in Articulation, Respect for All, and Behavior Intervention Plans, etc. 
Our Borough Field Support Center provides ongoing monthly professional development sessions. Professional Development 
Our ENL teachers attend monthly ENL meetings provided by the Borough Field Support Center and other workshops offered 
through the Dept. of ELLs. The professional development focuses on topics of compliance and issues dealing with curriculum 
and instruction such as the ENL Adaptive Balanced Literacy, ENL Standards, QTEL, Math and Science instruction for ELLs as per 
the CCSS ELA and Math.  
Professional Development is done monthly by the professional development team. Our Professional Development Calendar 
includes sessions from September-June. There are many topics including: CIE, Goal settings for groups of 
students/teachers/administrators, Danielson Framework for Teaching, Baseline Assessments, CCLS, Designing rigorous 
instruction, Flexible Scheduling, Data Analysis, Cyberbullying, RTI, etc.  
The professional development team includes the Principal and the Assistant Principals. Classroom teachers receive on-going 
professional development on how to differentiate instruction to meet the academic needs of ELL students.  
Professional development occurs during grade conferences, faculty conferences and monthly professional development 
sessions. Staff development will include training for all teachers in ENL methodologies. Training will be done by the Borough 
Field Support Center for ELL Curriculum and Instruction. A review of teacher records will be conducted to assess need for the 
training to staff. Several of the teachers working at our school are long time staff members, many of which were trained. For 
those teachers that must fulfill the training requirement, training will be provided on site during Lunch and Learns or 
professional periods by our ENL teachers ..   
Teachers also have grade wide common planning periods and differentiate to meet student’s needs academically and 
linguistically. Additionally, they have participated in many ELL webinars and received PD through The Teaching Channel 
website for Common Core-aligned instructional strategies.     
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Ms. Mossen and Ms. McDonald work collaboratively with all staff to provide support in assisting our ELL students as they 
transition from one school level to the next. Our ENL teachers will support staff needs including: professional development, 
best approach methodology, ENL prototype, data analysis, comprehensive needs assessment, parental involvement, 
compliance and instructional issues, preparation for the NYSESLAT and program design. As for our elementary level and middle 
school level guidance counselors,  they receive support in how to assist ELLs as they transition from elementary to middle 
and/or high school.  Also,  our counselors provide our elementary and middle school students with a list of ,  specialized 
programs in Middle Schools, ELL High Schools , open house opportunities, and summer school preparation courses for ELLs.   
The professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all teachers and 50% of total hours for 
ENL teachers will be provided in multiple ways.Teachers will participate in ongoing Professional Development in ELL 
methodology and strategies in order to complete ELL-specific professionsl development with the ENL Teachers. PD will be on-
going and presented in accordance with the LAP’s academic principles for the high quality instruction of ELLs. Topics will 
include literacy, informal and formal assessments, translating the NYSESLAT data into effective instruction for all levels, 
materials related to ELL education including books and Internet resources. Records will be updated after each session.

Records of agendas and attendance are kept in the teacher's file located in the Main Office Rm 145. 
Periodically during professional learning team meetings ELL training is provided by our ENL teachersl. Teachers also have grade 
wide common planning periods and differentiate to meet student’s needs academically and linguistically.  
    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school provides annual individual meetings with parents or guardians of ELLs, at least once a year, in addition to parent-
teacher conferences, initial parent orientations,  quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for 
parents or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s English 
language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  This additional meeting will be 
conducted by Ms. Mossen and Mrs. McDonald, ENL Teachers, Ms. Stillwell, Parent Coordinator, classroom teacher, and a 
interpretation/translation service provider in the parent/guardians preferred language (if applicable). It will be scheduled for 
every Tuesday at 2:30pm. Attendance logs will be recorded and stored in Room 217.  
  
We have staff available for translation service in the parent/guardians preferred language. If necessary we contact the Office 
of Translation and Interpretation Unit for provisions.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
We will individually meet with the parents or guardians of English language learners at least once a year, in addition to parent-
teacher conferences, initial parent orientations, quarterly progress meetings or other scheduled meetings provided for parents 
or guardians, to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language development progress, their child's English language 
proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. This additional meeting may include 
school staff necessary to sufficiently inform the parents or guardians about the child's language development in all content 
areas in English and in the child's home language in the case of students enrolled in a bilingual education program. This 
meeting will be conducted with a qualified interpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or 
guardian best understands. The ENL teacher has a compliance binder and data binder to retain all records of her outreach to 
parents whether face to face, email, letters, or by phone conference. We keep parent engagement appointments sheets, 
parent sign in sheets, and parent communication logs on record.   Meetings are conducted with a qualified 
interpreter/translator, through the Translation and Interpretation Unit, if needed. We also currently have 6 personnel available 
on staff for translation and interpretation.  
  
Our parents are very involved in Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. They assist and provide Spanish and Arabic translation to other 
parents, and are present in the school during the school day to work as parent volunteers. The parent coordinator is culturally 
sensitive to the needs of our parents and coordinates events that will keep our parents involved within the school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jessica Romero, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

In order to fulfill Section VII of Chancellor’s Regulations A-663 we will provide a translated version of the Bill of Parent 
Rights and Responsibilities to each parent requiring language assistance and whose first language is a covered 
language. We will post translated signs indicating the availability of interpretation services, in the covered languages. 
Such signs will be displayed in the entrance behind the security desk, main office and the parent coordinator’s office. 
We will have a school safety plan in place. PS/MS183Q has Spanish and Haitian Creole translators (in house school 
staff and parent volunteers) available for interpretation services at group or one-to –one meetings. If translation is 
needed in another language we will contact the Translation and Interpretation Unit for any interpretation phone 
services or one-to-one meetings. Translation services will be promoted through the parent handbook, Bill of Parent 
Rights and Responsibilities and at Parent Association meetings. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services we will distribute the NYC Parent 
Survey yearly. Also we will use ongoing feedback from the Parent Coordinator regarding parent satisfaction or 
concerns. We will make the needed changes when necessary.
