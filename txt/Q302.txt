Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Queens High School for Information, Research and Technology (QIRT) strives to provide students with a 
comprehensive learning experience by preparing them for success in college and beyond. We are creating a positive 
learning environment attuned to the academic, social and physical needs of our students, their parents and the 
surrounding community. Our goal is to accomplish this through the implementation of technology, community and 
parent partnerships and enrichment activities. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Academic: 

Committed to enhancing our students’ academic experience, QIRT encourages learning through personal discovery, 
primarily through our career exploration curriculum and Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs that will 
make our students college and career ready. The mission of QIRT is to create a learning environment where students 
transition from high school to the “real world” with the necessary skills to succeed.  

Social:  

Since 2008, QIRT has partnered with a number of organizations and community members to help meet the diverse 
needs of our student body. These partnerships include, Northwell Health, District Parent Advisory Council 27 (DPAC 
27), City Council member Donovan Richards, Safe Space, the 101st precinct and the Queens District Attorney’s Office 
of Special Prosecution Services to provide Mentoring and Prevention Services.  

In 2014, QIRT also became a Community Learning School (CLS). Community Learning Schools serve as a hub for the 
community, providing services that students and families would typically have to seek elsewhere. QIRT provides 
students and families with a place to go as a one-stop service to meet their health, education, social and physical 
fitness needs.  

Physical:  

Through our partnership with Northwell Health, QIRT provides health and wellness care to students and families from 
mental health to physical fitness. Parents and students are also able to stay fit through Zumba classes that are offered 
every Tuesday evening. In addition, workshops on financial planning, healthy living and wellness planning are 
provided to families throughout the year.  

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special Populations:  

Over the past year our English Language Leaner (ELL) population grew nearly fifty percent. This increase lead to a 
greater emphasis on developing programs and strategies geared to meeting their specific needs. In response to the 
drastic increase, QIRT hired two additional English Second Language (ESL) teachers, one who serves as an ELL Liaison. 
The ELL Liaison is responsible for ensuring that the school remains in compliance with all English as a New Language( 
ENL) mandates and serves as a bridge- connecting teachers, students and their families. QIRT also has three bilingual 
counselors, who are able to provide counseling services in both English and Spanish.  

Improving the academic performance of our ELL and special needs population requires a focus on providing targeted 
intervention in the areas of math and literacy. English Language Learners receive math and science instruction in their 
native language through our Transitional Bilingual Program. Our special populations also receive academic 
intervention in the form of tutoring during lunch and after school. Our Math teachers also utilize ALEKS, an online 
math program. ALEKS uses adaptive questioning to quickly and accurately determine exactly what a student knows 
and doesn't know in a course. Students are then able to follow a differentiated pathway to master topics in their 
respective math courses.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Over the course of the year, QIRT has made considerable progress in the following areas of the framework- 
Collaborative Teachers and Supportive Environment. Teachers have demonstrated a true commitment to the vision 
and mission of the school. In August of 2014, a number of teachers volunteered to begin analyzing data prior to the 
start of the 2014-2015 Academic Year as members of the TALENT Team- a data team comprising of various members 
of the school community to support new Principals. The TALENT Team continued to meet and make great progress 
during the 2017-2018 Academic Year, paying special attention to the 2018 cohorts' progress towards credit and 
regents accumulation. In June 2018, QIRT was able to achieve a 78.7% graduation rate as a result of the efforts of the 
TALENT Team in leading teachers through the inquiry process. 

Common Planning Time (CPT) and Professional Development (PD) are also essential to our collaborative school 
community.Teachers meet regularly during CPT and PD-which is teacher generated and led. QIRT teachers also 
engage in ongoing inter-visitations and offer feedback to their colleagues over the course of the year.  

Key areas of focus for the 2018-2019 school year include continuing to develop rigorous lessons/unit plans and 
forming additional partnerships with community based organizations to support students' academic and social 
growth.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Data collected from a variety of sources including the SAT Exam, Measures Of Student Learning (MOSL) and 
Regents Examinations ( June/August 2018) indicate that our students reach the 12th grade with gaps in their 
college readiness skills. In an effort to ensure that our students are fully supported in the area of rigorous 
instruction, QIRT will continue the process of reviewing and revising unit plans to ensure alignment to the CCLS. 
Furthermore, QIRT will continue its work around adopting the Next Generation Science Standards, in addition to 
the CCLS in order to ensure college and career readiness. This effort requires effective planning that provides a 
consistent and clear understanding of what students are expected to learn in school and beyond.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will have completed all subject related units that demonstrate alignment to common 
core shifts and practices,including the Next Generation Science Standards. Progress will be measured through the Tri-
State Rubric and The Educators Evaluating the Quality of Instructional Products (EQUIP) Rubric from 
www.engageny.org. Student performance will be positively impacted as evidenced by a 2% increase in Regents 
results across all core subjects.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

Teachers will participate in Common Planning Time (CPT) on a 
bi-weekly basis in order to address the implementation of the 
Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)/Next Generation 
Science and share assessment data. The CPT will also be 
designated as time for teachers to examine measures of 
student learning aligned to CCLS to meet the needs of our 
diverse student body. Teachers will engage families and 
support their understanding through various outreach 
methods such as telephone and email contact. 

Teachers will participate in professional development during 
Common Planning Time in order to develop best practices for 
the implementation of Depth of Knowledge, CCLS and the Next 
Generation Science Standards in lesson planning, as well as 
using the Danielson Framework for Teaching and Learning. In 
addition, a dedicated Educational Consultant will be scheduled 
to offer feedback on current practices and future pathways of 
CCLS alignment and the selected teaching framework. First 
year teachers will receive ongoing lesson clinics with 
instructional specialists and their assigned mentors. 

In order to include teachers in the decision making process- 
with regard to assessment and evaluation of effective 
strategies and activities, grade and department teams will 
meet during CPT to review interdisciplinary strategies and 
protocols based on CCLS, Danielson’s Framework, and 
Response To Intervention /Universal Design for Learning.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
 

Teachers will utilize Skedula, an online school management system to post homework assignments, grades and 
student progress reports. Students and parents receive a unique access code to Skedula at the beginning of the 
school year to gain access to the program. In addition, teachers will utilize Skedula as a web application to 
communicate with families via text messages. Teachers will be able to engage in real time communication with 
parents and families regarding their child's progress. Progress reports and individualized supports are discussed 
during scheduled conferences with teachers, students and families. Teachers will also utilize Castle Learning and 
Vocabulary.com as online resources that students can utilize outside of the classroom to support their academic 
performance. In addition, the Parent Coordinator will work with teachers to develop plans to offer homework and 
mentoring sessions for families, develop and prepare resources for families to use to support their children's 
learning at home and host school and community Resource Fairs that connect families to available resources and 
services.  

September 2018- Meet the Teacher Night: The Parent Coordinator will host an information session in which we will 
provide an overview of the online resources available to help families support their children at home.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
QIRT views creating a supporting environment as being aligned to college and career readiness. We pride ourselves 
on fostering an environment where students feel safe, supported and challenged to strive for their personal best. 
According to the 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot, student’s College and Career Readiness was 26%. While our 
College and Career Readiness increased from 22 % as noted in our 2015-2016 School Quality Snapshot, this 
indicates a need to place greater emphasis on improving academic rigor across all classrooms through the CCLS and 
the Next Generation in Science Standards, as well as providing greater access to our Advance Placement and 
University in the High School Program. In addition, we would like to foster an environment in which students are 
encouraged to retake the Math and ELA exams in order to obtain a 70 and 75, respectively, as an indicator of their 
college readiness. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By August 2019, College and Career Readiness level will increase from 48.9% to 55% as measured by performance 
on the Common Core English Language Arts and Algebra 1 Regents Exam.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

We will create instructional programs for target populations 
based on a needs assessment from various sources of data 
including Measures Of Student Learning (MOSL) , baseline 
assessments and Regents scores. 

Time will be allocated during Professional Development for 
content area teachers to design assessments, based on 
CCLS/Next Generation Science Standards and Regents exams 
midway into each semester. Results from these exams will be 
aligned with previous scores including measuring school-wide 
progress and inform need-based interventions. These 
interventions will be additionally guided by the DYO data. 
Students will have common midterms given by teachers and 
DYO data will be submitted to administration for review and 
feedback. From these results, strategic student groupings in 
daily classes, after school tutorials, and Saturday Academic 
Programs will be reconsidered and, if necessary, revised. 
Individual meetings with teachers, counselors, and other staff 
will be scheduled accordingly. 

We will develop entry point specific intervention programs. 
Additionally, through strategic and specific academic 
interventions, students will receive differentiated instruction 
specific to their needs in all classes. Students will receive 
Academic Intervention Services (AIS) support in specific classes 
after school and on Saturdays. Success will be measured 
through increased grades in that class and increased scores on 
the correlating Regents exams.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Over the past year our school has seen a drastic increase in the number of students with disabilities and English 
Language Learners. Combined, these two subgroups account for nearly 50% of the student body. In addition, many 
students enter our school with interrupted formal education and/or scoring on level 1 and level 2 on their 8th 
grade Math and ELA exams. The shift to Common Core has brought greater emphasis on developing literacy and 
critical thinking skills for all students. This shift dictates the necessity for teachers to collaborate and develop 
strategies that seek to address the needs of the student body and targeted subgroups.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all department teams will design, evaluate and revise three rigorous writing tasks that are aligned to 
Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) and using writing across the curriculum methods in order to increase 
student proficiency in writing across all subjects as measured by the Tri-State EQuiP rubric. Students with disabilities 
and English Language Learners will improve their writing skills as evidenced by a one point increase on the subject 
level rubrics.

to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

QIRT content teams will work together during their designated 
content meeting periods to develop a comprehensive plan in 
order to achieve this goal. The teams will begin working 
together in September. As a department, they will utilize a 
number of different resources that will assist in monitoring 
individual student progress. 

Teachers will develop extended time learning opportunities. 
Students will have the opportunity to develop their writing 
skills through after school tutoring, lunchtime tutoring and 
through Saturday tutoring programs. These additional 
opportunities will allow students to work in smaller groups on 
literacy skills and areas in need of development. Teachers will 
meet in their content teams to analyze writing samples and 
revise plans/ strategies as needed. Teachers will provide 
students with progress reports to monitor achievement and 
also inform parents of extended learning activities they are 
recommending for their child. 

Content teams will utilize various educational protocols to 
provide a focus for discussions. Content teams have 
experience using the Looking at Student Work protocol to help 
modify lessons/unit plans based on evidence of student 
learning and performance.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
In an effort to support families in understanding of Collaborative Teaching and Strategies to promote teacher-
parent collaboration, the bi-monthly QIRT Parent Newsletter will include a section on specific strategies and 
approaches parents can use at home to support their children as writers and learners. During the parent-teacher 
conferences, teams of teachers are able to explain the benefits of collaborative teaching and provide feedback on 
student progress from different angles focusing on specific skill sets and approaches. In addition, teachers will 
utilize Skedula, a web application that allows school staff to communicate with families via text messages. Teachers 
can utilize this resource to engage in real time communication with parents and families regarding their child's 
progress. Parents will also be able to log in to Skedula or Pupil Path, where they can track the child's progress in all 
of their classes. In addition, families will learn about rigorous AP programs offered at our school through the AP 
PACE initiative. Parents and families will learn about the classes and how these opportunities can help support 
their child’s academic growth.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Queens High School for Information, Research and Technology, in compliance 
with The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Queens High School for Information, Research and Technology will support parents and families of Title I students 
by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The CS strategy is integrated into academic instruction at QIRT through our various partnerships to promote academic 
and social growth. These programs are aligned with classroom curricula and provide services both during the school 
day and after school. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will have completed all subject related units that demonstrate alignment to common 
core shifts and practices, including the Next Generation Science Standards. This will support students in their college 
and career academic studies as measured by the Tri-State Rubric and The Educators Evaluating the Quality of 
Instructional Products (EQUIP) Rubric from www.engageny.org. What has been shared above is the general school 
goal however, our advisory board is currently working on community school-specific goals to begin this school year.  

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
By removing critical barriers to learning, such as chronic absenteeism or asthma, we will be ensuring that students are 
better prepared and ready to learn and achieve academically

lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

QIRT has participated in the United Federation of Teacher's, Community Learning Schools (CLS) Initiative since 2014. 
As such, we have conducted regular needs assessments, through formal and informal surveying of staff, students and 
families. Our existing Community School Director, has used these findings to guide the work of this initiative and 
provide the appropriate resources.  

 

Partners are only selected after determining they can adequately address the needs of our constituents. Our school 
currently offers academic help and tutoring after school and evening adult classes all due to the needs of our 
particular students and community. CBOs are introduced and/or matched with relevant subject area teachers to 
ensure the proper communication of needs. 

 

We are on our way to being classified as a Partnership School with a thriving Advisory Board that consists of parents, 
students, staff and key members of our community that have taken a vested interest in our school. Many of which 
also participate in other aspects of our school, working with our School Leadership Team and Parent Teacher 
Association. 

 

The Principal will meet with the CS Advisory Board on a weekly basis. Each meeting will have a specific area of focus 
that includes utilizing the New Visions Data Sorter to analyze trends in student achievement. The CS Board will make 
recommendations to the Principal, as well develop Action Plans and data check-ins to support new initiatives to

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
Queens High School for Information,Research and Technology ( QIRT) has created an After 
School supplemental program using the push-in model for English Language Learners (ELLs) to 
serve our 106 ELLs. We currently have 10 ELLs on the entering level, 22 students on emerging 
level, 24 transitional, and 30 expanding students.  The supplemental instructional program during 
the after school extended day classes will serve to work on academic intervention and academic 
vocabulary acquisition for our newcomers, SIFE, and other ELLs who require academic 
intervention and English language support .  There is a certified ENL teacher who will work with 
students during After School program.  Supplemental instruction is available during the wee k 
(Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays) as well as during Saturday Program. The Program has been 
designed with the goal of teaching students content area and language skills required to pass their 
Regents exams and feel successful in their content area classes. Besides textbooks and units of 
study, technology will be be utilized to personalize and differentiate learning based on student 
needs. Castle Learning, Vocabulary.com, Kahoot, and Brain Pop are some of the online 
resources teachers will be using to differentiate instruction and meet every student at his/her 
level.The language of instruction will be English with Native Language support. A blend of ENL 
and Bilingual Program will be used with newcomers/entering students to ensure their successful 
integration into their new academic and social environment. 
  
Title III ELL After School Program 
After School programs will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:45 p.m.-3:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. - 
4:15 pm.  A certified ELL teacher and two bi-lingual teachers work collaboratively to provide 
small group supplemental instruction during these days for 12 students each section for a total of 
24 students served.  The program will have one group of twelve students in each session from 
grades 9-12.  The program will be offered from September to June for 50 sessions.  The 
supplemental instructional program during the after school extended day classes will serve to 
work on academic intervention and acquiring of academic vocabulary.  The program will use the 
following materials:  Laptop - Online Reading Program - and a textbook Milestones along with 
Literature Circle Books from our classroom library and ENL Academic Resource Center . 
Title III Saturday Program 
 Our Saturday Program will be offered from January to June for 20 sessions. The bilingual 
Mathematics teacher will provide supplementary instruction in Algebra in both Spanish and 
English from 9am to 12 Noon. There will be one group of 12 students served from grades 10-12 
who need supplementary instruction to meet the mandated standards in this course . The program 
will use the following materials:  Textbook -  Big Ideas Mathematics and laptops for Big Ideas 
Math online program and Khan Academy. 
 
Student attendance, curriculum, parent notification letters and other records will be maintained 
by teachers, collected by the Program Supervisor and stored in the Assistant Principal's Office. 
Parents will be notified through automated voice messages and letters available in parents' 
preferred language.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Some of the assessment  tools we use to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs include the NYSITELL and its Spanish version 
(Language Assessment Battery in Spanish) and also teacher created assessments in English and in Spanish. The ENL and the 
Native Language Art teachers work together to gather data that informs our school's instructional plan for our ELLs. The data 
indicates that many of our ELLs are not proficient in their home language. Nearly 40% of our ELLs fell within the first and 
second quartile of the Home Language Assessment. We try to support their first language literacy skills in their Native 
Language Arts class.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Instructional planning for our ELLs is guided by school-wide structures that start from carefully planned out Professional 
Development sessions for teachers and school staff. At least 15% of our professional development sessions are dedicated to 
improving our ELL instruction. Time is also allotted during the Common Planning Sessions for teachers of ELLs to put that

knowledge into practice. An ENL liaison  - usually an ENL teacher(s)- is available to assist content area teachers with utilizing 
formal and summative data to guide their instructional planning.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Some  of the success criteria we use to evaluate our programs for ELLs include the consistent improvement of student 
performance on the NYSESLAT, improving scores on periodic assessments, credit accumulation, and passing grades on the 
Regents exams.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative results have been gathered, our school-wide ENL team analyzes the data and creates structures to 
address those students needs and pathways to their academic success. Deliberate and thoughtful programming is a crucial 
component of any successful program for ELLs. Summative data is used for student programming, as well as Extended Day and 
Saturday Academy.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
In serving ELLs, our main focus is improving the overall quality of core instruction and making sure that our students have 
ongoing high-quality opportunities to learn and are succeeding. We use data to determine whether students are benefiting 
from the instructional program offered in our school. Some of the assessments we use include periodic assessments, 
NYSESLAT, Regents, and ongoing classroom assessments. Our ultimate goal is to build effective and rigorous instructional 
programs which include tiered layers of additional supports like “Double Dose of Instruction” and “Intensive Intervention 
Measures” before resorting to referrals and evaluations for Special Education Services. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data patterns on assessments reveal that the majority of our ELLs are freshmen at the beginning stages of language 
acquisition. We also noticed that our ELL students perform considerably better on the Listening and Speaking sections 
compared to Reading and Writing. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During our Data Team meetings, grade leaders and administration utilize the New Visions Student Sorter and the Education 
Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to analyze credit accumulation and Regents passing rates. The results are used to plan targeted 
intervention for students, such as tutoring during lunch and after school, extended day, and Saturday Academy.  Grade team 
leaders disseminate the information to teachers during Common Planning time and Professional Development sessions.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Currently we have a Freestanding ENL instructional program that services 137 ELLs. The majority of our ELLs are at the 
beginning  levels of ELL proficiency. These students receive 3 units of ENL instructional time per week through 
Freestanding ENL and Integrated ENL. A vital component of our program is collaborative team teaching that occurs 
between content area teachers and an  ENL teacher. Both teachers plan together with the  special needs of ELLs in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

mind and implement the lessons cooperatively. We also have self-contained ENL classes for Entering, Emerging, and 
Transitioning levels of ELLs. ENL/ELA is an important component of our program, especially when it comes to 
preparing students for the ELA Regents. Teachers also meet weekly during common planning to discuss lesson plans, 
assessments and upcoming instructional units and receive feedback from administrators and colleagues.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

As per CR Part 154-2, our Entering and Emerging ELLs are currently receiving 3 units of ENL instructional time in the form of 
self-contained ENL classes and/or Integrated ENL with core subjects, such as ELA, Math, Global History and American History. 
Our Transitioning and Expanding ELLs are receiving one unit of ENL and one unit of ELA per week. Students on the 
Commanding Level receive 0.2 units of ENL instruction per week in the form of Freestanding or Integrated ENL. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In the self-contained ENL classes, the majority of the content is delivered in English. Native language is used strategically for 
academic support in the form of lesson previews/summaries, key vocabulary previews, and when student responses indicate 
the need for clarifications or further explanations.The content area teacher and the ENL teacher plan together to make 
content accessible and meaningful for all students. Teachers also differentiate their lessons using a variety of resources in both 
English and Spanish. Native Language supports are used during each step of instruction, starting with content previews and 
ending with assessments. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ENL teachers work in tandem  with Native Language Arts (NLA) teachers and subject area teachers to evaluate and utilize 
students' home language skills as those are viewed as yet another potentially indispensable learning tool to access and 
negotiate meaning in their content area and NLA classes. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We try to accommodate all the different subgroups by placing them in an appropriate level class. When this is not possible 
and the groups are mixed, we differentiate instruction by targeting their specific needs. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Some of our favorite proven instructional strategies that help our ELL-SWDs access challenging academic content include 
graphic representation of content, graphic/visual supports, "chunking" of larger portions of complex text, providing students 
with ample opportunities for processing and internalizing material, explicit instruction in learning skills and metacognition, 
differentiating instruction based on students' interests, needs, learning styles, and language proficiency levels. We are 
adapting the "Collections" ELA curriculum to ensure that materials are grade and age-appropriate and aligned to Common 
Core Learning Standards. Achieve 3000, a differentiated online reading program, is used to help ELLs access the meaning of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

complex texts.  Laptop carts are also placed in every classroom to ensure access to technology. Special resources are available 
for newcomers such as content area textbooks from ACCESS Series with English language supports.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELLs with special needs receive services according to the academic supports necessary, as stated in their 
Individualized Education Program (IEP). Most of our ELLs who are classified as SWD have native-like listening and speaking 
skills and are overall English-dominant, but struggle with reading and writing in English. These students are assigned an 
integrated ENL/ELA class that targets their reading and writing skills as well as other language-specific and general skills 
required to pass the ELA Regents examination. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We offer co-taught classes in all core content areas with a licensed ENL teacher and content area teachers. We provide a 
variety of intervention services. After-school tutoring and courses are available for all ELL students, grades 9-12 in all content 
areas including ELA/NLA, Global History, United States History, Integrated Algebra, Geometry, and Living Environment. The 
goal of these programs is to improve language skills and content understanding to ensure success on state examinations. 
Struggling students are mandated to attend PM school in order to make up for deficient credits and skills. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

One of the most significant improvements will be the expansion of our co-teaching model in order to help our ELLs further 
succeed in their content area classes. We also plan to introduce "block" instruction for our ELL seniors to provide more 
targeted supports, promote networking and collaborative skills.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not Applicable. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded all of the same opportunities to participate in any and all school activities. Information inside the school, as 
well as outgoing information is always translated into Spanish so that all students and families have access to important 
notices and announcements. All daily announcements are made by students and staff in both English and Spanish to celebrate 
our diverse school culture and make information accessible to all. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Some of the instructional materials that we use to support our ELLs include MindPlay reading program, Empower reading 
program with bilingual support, Think Through Math -  an online differentiated program that offers live tutoring in English and 
Spanish, Castle Learning - online Regents prep tool, Vocabulary.com, and ACCESS series textbooks in core subject areas: Global 
History, U.S. History, Living Environment, and Math.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our ENL program, language support is ensured by translations of instructional materials (when appropriate/required), co-
teaching, bilingual editions of programs/instructional materials, bilingual dictionaries/reference materials. Most 
assessment/exams are available in the home language (Spanish). 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our school Instructional Committee, as well as teacher teams routinely discuss and evaluate NLA services and resources for 
academic rigor and grade level appropriateness. Our ultimate goal is to make challenging academic material accessible to ELLs 
by providing various scaffolds like schema building, extra-linguistic supports, breaking down large portions of material into 
more manageable chunks.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We have collaborated with other schools in the building to share the resources with our ELLs and the families. Some of those 
initiatives include collaborative cultural field trips, parents workshops on immigration, and shared administration and support 
during the NYSESLAT. 
 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We are currently working on our new bilingual orientation program for new students to supplement the orientation students 
receive from the guidance counselor, their NLA and/or ENL teachers, as well as other bilingual personnel. One of the strategies 
that works well is our "buddy" system, when ELLs or former ELLs who are well familiar with the school take care of the 
newcomers. Our Parent Coordinator introduces herself to all new parents and reiterates our open door policy that allows 
parents to receive assistance from school personnel in case they have any questions or concerns. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Along with English as a new language, we offer Spanish as  a native language arts class to keep up and develop their native 
language skills. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Not applicable.  
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Teachers are surveyed at the beginning of the school year to identify topics to be offered during professional development. 
Professional development is then differentiated based on the results. Teachers of ELLs are able to meet together on a weekly 
or needs basis to discuss relevant topics. These topics include: The principles of second language acquisition,  strategic use of 
native language,  co-teaching within the ELL classroom, cultural awareness and sensitivity, and effective instructional strategies 
to keep abreast of the latest developments in NLA curriculum. Teachers are also provided with the opportunity to attend 
professional development workshops outside the building.  
Teachers participate in workshops that help them align their curricula in NLA, ELA, and other content areas with Common Core 
Standards. Our teachers also attend the English Language Arts "Collections" workshop, which is aligned to Common Core 
Standards. Our ENL Coordinator is also trained in Literacy Design Collaborative, which is also aligned with Common Core 
Standards. Our ELL teachers turn-key this information to staff during professional development sessions and workshops. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

Professional Development sessions are organized by our Assistant Principal who creates the agenda and tracks the attendance 
for each meeting. A calendar is provided to teachers informing them of the topics that will be covered during the year. 
Teachers are also surveyed to identify specific areas of their instruction in need support in as it relates to the ELL population. 
Teachers are also involved in preparing and facilitating workshops that build on their own classroom experiences and sharing 
best practices that have proven to be effective with our students.       
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The parents of our ELLs are provided with relevant information  about our NLA program, students' language development 
progress, and language development needs in all content areas during our Open School Afternoons (one in the Fall and one in 
the Spring) and Teacher-Parent conferences (one in the Fall and one in the Spring). Monthly ESL workshops are offered to our 
parents. The parents are provided with translation services if needed; they receive a general overview of the curricula and 
academic programs, as well as allowed time to have one-on -one conferences with a student's teachers. Translators are 
available on site and through the DOE.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parental involvement in the programs and activities is critical to the success of the programs and the children. 
Our Parent Coordinator notifies  parents of upcoming meetings in their native languages via notices and automated phone 
calls. At PTA meetings and at workshops created for parents of ELLs, assistance is provided to parents of children served by the 
school. Some of the topics include understanding their rights and choices as parents of ELLs, the State's academic content and 
achievement standards, the state and local academic assessments, as well as alternate assessments. Our College Adviser 
reviews graduation requirements, explains how to monitor their child's progress, and how to communicate with their children 
and track their children's progress. Bilingual faculty is also on hand for interpretation and all materials disseminated are 
available in the home languages of our ELL population.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carl Manalo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

All QIRT parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can understand. Our 
language data is derived via a multitude of assessments. Initially, all QIRT parents complete the Home Language 
Survey (which is entered into ATS) upon a student's admission to our school. The home language indicated on the 
Home Language Survey is also entered on the Emergency Contact card. The ENL teacher is aware of the home 
languages and advises content area teachers of parents' preferred language. The ENL teacher also informs 
administration and support staff of students' home language. The home languages of our ELLS are: Spanish - vast 
majority, Haitian Creole, French, and Urdu .  

All school correspondence sent home to parents is translated into Spanish. Since a considerable number of staff 
members speak Spanish, they are called upon to interpret whenever warranted i.e: Parent Teacher Conferences 
other visits to QIRT and phone calls home. Various QIRT staff members speak Haitian Creole and French and they 
also assist with translation. Robo call announcements are sent home to parents in their preferred language. QIRT
