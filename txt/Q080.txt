Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The Mission of the Thurgood Marshall Magnet School Community is to educate, motivate, and challenge all scholars: 

To become lifelong learners, risk takers, and problem solvers 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

To foster creative expression through literacy, music, and the arts 

To encourage the advancement in mathematical thinking and technology 

To embrace the parent community as partners in education 

To emphasize community involvement 

 

The goal of the Thurgood Marshall School Community is to empower each child with the social, intellectual, and 
critical skills that will enable them to reach their potential as adults in a global society. 

 

Thurgood Marshall School’s vision is to become a School of Excellence where all scholars, parents, and staff will work 
together to help our scholars exceed the standards in all academic areas.  

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Thurgood Marshall Magnet School is located in Jamaica, Queens. Our school is a very diverse school. There are 
many cultures that merge to make up the fabric of the school. It is a kaleidoscope of teaching and learning. 

There are a total of 527 students and 21.82% of those students have IEPs. 51.61% of our students are female and 
48.39% are male. 85.2% of our students are black, 9.11% Hispanic, 4.37% Asian and multi-racial, .95% whites and .19% 
Alaskan Native. 

 

Parents are vital to the success of the school and the scholars. The current level of parental involvement continues to 
grow. We still need to increase parental involvement. We have tried Parent Academy, workshops, open door policy, 
open classroom, and much more and we tend to only have a handful of parents. We have tried AM and PM 
recognizing parents have to work and still we only have a handful of parents. The PTA has become a vital partner in 
informing parents and keeping an academic focus on the things they do. We recognized perfect attendance each 
month and that brings out some parents. The SLT has sat down and decided to go full speed ahead to create activities 
that will increase our parent involvement.  

 

PS 80 Q instructional focus is to engage our scholars in activities that involve critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, 
and cooperation. We embrace the 21st Century 4Cs. Scholars will show evidence of deeper understanding of the 
content by engaging in partnerships, group, and class discussions. This school year we will have a strong focus on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

questioning and discussions. Through PLCs and planning opportunities teachers will create a cooperative 
environment. 

 

In an effort to provide rigorous instruction to our scholars we have done the following: 

1. Creating Themed Curricula: Our Curriculum Design Team has developed themed curriculum overview maps for core 
subjects ELA, STEM subjects, and Social Studies based on the UBD framework. Each curriculum map provides an 
overview of each unit’s overarching goals, concepts, essential questions, content, skills, methods of assessment, and 
lists of activities/resources. Our students receive magnet theme instruction for at least 3 hours per week. Technology 
rich instruction was written into each curriculum unit. Our Curriculum Maps are posted on the School's Website so 
that all teachers, as well as parents, could have easy access. 

 

2. STEM – STEM instruction is infused across the core content areas using a hands-on, inquiry based approach (i.e., 
engineering design model Ask, Imagine, Plan, Create, Improve) and is informed by the Next Generation Science 
Standards (NGSS). Students learn to think like STEM professionals in the way they approach problems and plan 
solutions. Students ask questions and define problems; develop and use models; plan and carry out investigations; 
analyze and interpret data; use mathematics and computational thinking; construct explanations and design 
solutions; engage in evidence-based argument; and obtain, evaluate, and communicate information. STEM instruction 
is supported by Lego WeDo Robotics; Engineering is Elementary (EIE); and is also connected to literacy and social 
studies. 

 

3. Engineering is Elementary (EIE). EIE workshops are tailored to meet the needs of its particular audience and will 
include hands-on learning, modeling effective pedagogical strategies, group work, and reflection.Activities that 
support STEM integration include: (1) Project Based Learning Institutes; (2) Magnet School Assistance Program 
(MSAP) professional development; (3) working with classroom teachers on developing STEM tasks; (4) demonstration 
lessons, coaching, and mentoring from Magnet Resource Teachers; (5) LEGO WeDo Robotics Training. 

 

4. Professional Learning Communities (PLC) help to guide and support classroom teachers in implementing STEM in 
the classroom. Through PLC's classroom teachers have learned about: (1) The new literacy, math, and science 
standards; (2) How to interpret STEM data for traditionally underrepresented groups of students (i.e. girls, minority 
students, ELLs, and disabled students); (3) How to differentiate STEM instruction to create learning opportunities for 
all students to ensure equal access to new STEM academic content; and (4) How to develop curriculum units aligned 
to the new standards. 

 
5. Common Core State Standards (CCSS) assist teachers in revising curriculum mapping units to align with the 
Common Core’s cognitive demands and its requirement for a greater focus on argument and discourse. Our school 
has received ongoing Professional Development in the following competencies of Danielson’s Framework: (1) 
Designing Coherent Instruction (focusing on the need for deliberate planning related to rigorous learning objectives, 
links with students’ prior knowledge, and student engagement); and (2) Questioning and Discussion Techniques 
(which engage students in challenging their peers and critiquing others’ reasoning). We are strengthening teachers’ 
ability to “ramp up” the rigor of math and science instruction as they align to the Common Core Standards with NYC’s 
math curriculum. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

 

6. Differentiated Learning: Our school uses technology in innovative ways that fosters educational equity for all 
students. Our school provides students identified as having learning disabilities with mandated services, while 
differentiating instruction to help them achieve at the same level as peers without disabilities. Teachers develop 
flexible curriculum goals, materials, methods, and assessments that meet the needs of diverse learners. Our school 
provides the supports and services (e.g., accommodations, assistive technology devices) that will enable them to meet 
the challenge “to excel within the general education curriculum based on the Common Core Standards.” 

 

Cooperative Learning: Our school is committed to increasing student interaction and recognizing the ability to work 
cooperatively as essential preparation for many types of careers. Collaboration with peers from our school, around 
the city, and around the world will be an ongoing part of the projects’ online and blended learning, including project-
based learning (PBL), and both game-based and online modules. 

 

The school leader has a plan and a system in place to support teacher feedback and development through the use of 
the Danielson Framework, targeted teacher observations, inter-visitations, and the monitoring of teacher practices 
based on a consistent review of student data. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We had 18 ENL students last year ranging in all level on all grades. We will have 17 ENL students returning and any 
incoming K students and new admits. This population struggles with literacy skills and vocabulary development.  

We additionally have approx. 120 student with disabilities from grades K-5. The majority of these students are reading 
below grade level and are struggling in their reading and writing skills. The reading has also hindered their math 
progress due to the word problems.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

From 2018 -2019, our school made the most progress in the framework element of rigorous instruction. We utilized 
formative assessment to design lessons that allowed our scholars to use their 4c super skills. This year we will have a 
strong focus on critical thinking and formative assessment. Formative assessments includes checking for 
understanding, aligning learning targets, aligning tasks, questioning and discussion, success criteria, and data driven 
instruction.  

Key area of focus for this year: Effective School Leadership

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. The school's strengths relative to this Framework element are that, because of our rigorous instruction, our Levels 3 
and 4 on the State Math Assessment increased from 26% in grades 3-5 in 2017 to 34% in 2018. Our Level 4 students 
more than doubled from 6% to 14% in those two years. Our third graders were ranked 24th in the District in 2017 and 
were ranked 17th in 2018. 

 

.2. The historical data shows that the students have a lower performance percentage on word problems within the 
classroom data, MOSL performance task, and on the constructive response sections of the state assessments. The 
goal gives students an opportunity to use the mathematical practices of modeling in mathematics and constructing 
viable arguments and critiquing the reasoning of others while engaging in solving word problems.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 10% increase in the number of students performing at the proficient level at solving word 
problems through modeling and giving an explanation that proves why their model and answer is correct as measured 
by the pre and post Performance Based Assessment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

From our administrative observations, teacher survey and IPC conference and current trends in education, we saw the 
need to continue but refine our inquiry work around formative assessment which we implemented in the 2015-2016 
school year. Trends overtime in ELA performance on the standardized state assessments indicate an increase of 4% of 
students on or above grade level due to our inquiry work around formative assessment. Studies show that work 
around collaborative inquiry is an effective design for professional learning as it recognizes the role of teachers in 
ongoing school effectiveness. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We received developing in the QR indicator 1.2 in the PPO visits for the 2015-2016 school year. The Advance data also 
shows that teachers are rated lower in sections 3B - Questioning and Discussion and 3D Assessment in Instruction.  

The feedback from the Quality Review states: 1.2 Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how 
students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the 
curricula, engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The school works closely with the HR point person in identification of highly effective qualified teachers. We attend 
the DOE hiring fairs, utilize the Open Market system and other DOE tools to gather resumes of prospective 
candidates. We ensure our hires have the proper credentials prior to interviewing. We request prospective teachers 
to bring a portfolio and be able to talk to it. We have also contacted the local colleges and universities for candidates 
to do their student teaching and then we have an impact on training and exposing them to the profession. We also 
support our paraprofessionals who are continuing their education to help them learn and become master teachers. 
Teachers with less than three years’ experience are provided with a mentor. Our mentors are trained by the NYC DOE 
Mentor Program and New Teacher’s Center with a focus on the 21 st century skills. In addition, some of our teachers 
have been trained from Paideia, Boston Children’s Museum-EIE, and New York Historical Society to support our 
Magnet Theme.  

Master Teacher will provide monthly professional development for para educators. Para Educators will receive 
certificates for completing online training.  

We support retention of our teachers through continual professional development strategies both in teams and 
through individualized support as needed. The administrative team works one to one with each teacher to identify 
areas of support, concern and next steps. A professional plan of action or discussion is in place to help the teachers 
grow professionally. Teachers have access to computers, laptops, Smart Boards, Promethean Boards, tablets, Go 
Math Professional Development, Mind Research Institute, Algebra for All, and Teachers College Professional 
Development. We are committed to retaining our teachers, encouraging them to participate in all Professional 
Development offered in house and by the Dept. of Education and continue developing a love of teaching. We provide 
tenure information for our un-tenured teachers and help them to visit best practice classrooms and take back some 
strategies for success in their classroom. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
All staff receives professional development that enables our students to meet Common Core Learning Standards. We 
employ the following strategies: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● Provide mandated professional development on the Mondays and Tuesdays for teachers and paraprofessionals 

● Professional Development team plans and executes professional development every Monday, utilizing our 
Professional Learning Committee Team and administration to present specific topics from a survey that was provided 
to the staff in June. 

Provide focused Professional Development on the previous year's data obtained from the NYS ELA/Math Test Scores, 
Learning Targets and Success Criteria, CCLS, Formative Assessment, Instruction, and Teacher's College Reading and

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
We conduct open house events where the parents and students are welcome to take a tour of the building. The 
Kindergarten teachers speak about the expectations in Kindergarten and do hands on workshops with the parents and 
incoming students. We also prepare a “Getting Ready for Kindergarten” packet that is given to our parents at 
registration with a few items they need to work on with their children in order to assist in the transition. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teacher teams meet regularly and make instructional decisions that impact the entire school community. Teachers 
have the leverage to make decisions about assessments in their grades and classes to measure student progress. We 
have a Data Instructional Team, Literacy Team, and Mathematics team that meet and discusses the results of the 
state assessments, reviews the various types of assessments that can be used to measure student learning and 
decides what the school will use as a measure. This team meets with the total staff body and discusses their decisions 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

to make everyone aware of the focus grade, the type of assessment and how we need to improve instruction to 
improve results. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Thurgood Marshall Magnet School of Multimedia and Communication - 
Public School 80Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School 
ESEA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and 
support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents 
informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. 
Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

Thurgood Marshall's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Thurgood Marshall Magnet School of Multimedia and Communication - Public School 80Q will support parents 
and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
Thurgood Marshall's Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESEA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools used at PS.80 to identify early literacy skills in ELL's include Running Records, TC On- Demand Pre 
assessments for ELA.  Baseline pre-assessment in Go Math and unit assessment in Go Math.  Data from assessments indicate 
that ELL students need support in acquiring phonemic awareness, reading and oral expression skills. Knowing this information 
allows us to plan our push-in and pull out groups based on skill that needs to be acquired.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

The second language development of our ENL students ex. phonic awareness, reading and oral expression skills will be 
targeted through literacy instruction pushed into the classroom or in a separate location. Our ENL teacher collaborate with 
classroom teachers to develop her push-in/pull out schedule. Our curriculum map is on line and shared with all staff in the 
building, the ENL teacher uses this document to support the work and gain access to the skills and strategies for all grades and 
subjects. Our ENL teacher attends grade team meetings and shares updates on students progress.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ongoing data analysis of the ELLs' progress and failures are measured by NYSITELL and NYSELAT NYC assessments,  Go 
Math pre and post unit and chapter assessments, Fountas and Pinnell running records that is administered 4 times a year, 
Teachers College On- demand pre assessment and teacher created assessments. Progress on these assessments are regularly 
addressed during bi-weekly RTI meetings, grade conferences and ongoing in-class observations. Once the problem areas are 
identified, necessary strategy shifts are discussed and applied to accommodate every ELL's diverse needs. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

After a review of our summative assessment data individualized goals will be created for each of the ELL students, Push in / 
pull out schedule will be adjusted to reflect the findings and students needing more support will be discussed in our bi-weekly 
RTI meetings.    
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
ELL students who are at-risk or academically challenged get additional support through a research-based intervention service, 
a tiered RTI educational system that meets every student's educational needs.  The RTI team meets every 2 weeks.  The team 
consists of two speech teachers, IEP teacher, Guidance Counselor, psychologist, and AP of Special Education.  RTI has 3 tiers; 
Tier 1 is for 9-12 weeks with intervention given in the classroom.   5 strategies are used and tracked and monitored and 
returned bi-weekly for review with the team and feedback given to the teacher on progress, little progress or no progress and 
next steps.  Tier 2 occurs after a letter of consent is obtained and the student receives  pull-out services twice a week for a 
period to work on skills of need for 9-12 weeks.  Tier 3 occurs after a consent letter is obtained from the family and the 
student is scheduled for pull-out service 3 times a week to work on the skills of need for 9-12 weeks.  For Tier 2 and 3, a 
progress tracker is still used and reviewed when the team meets bi-weekly.  Additionally a teacher report is obtained at the 
beginning of each tier. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data patterns do not appear in the data as last year we only had 13 students receiving ENL services and varied in scores, levels 
and grades.  We use the data from the NYSITELL, the NYSELAT, ELA and MATH stated tests to evaluate and inform our ELL 
programs.  
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

During grade conferences, RTI meetings and in school PLC meetings we discuss as a team the data from these assessments. 
Google documents with assessment information is shared with staff members and is updated frequently. We then use this 
data for class placement, ENL teacher push in/ pull out schedule and to help group our students according to their language 
proficiency levels.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At PS80, stand-alone and integrated ENL is implemented through a push-in an pull-out model.  For our push-in 
model  instruction is delivered to students based on their grade level. For our pull-out model instruction is delivered 
to students based on mixed proficiency level. The ENL teacher works cooperatively in collaboration with the 
mainstream teachers to ensure ELL students' progress.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           At PS80, the Assistant Principal and ENL teacher has created a servicing schedule that ensures all units of study and 
staffing requirements are met for ELL students, through both integrated and stand-alone ENL.  a. An ENL push-in and pull-out 
servicing schedule is created with the necessary instructional minutes required per week. Students on the same grade level are 
also programmed into the same classroom so that when the ENL teacher pushes in, she has a group to work with. Students in 
the Entering level require 360 minutes, with 180 in a standalone setting and 180 in an integrated setting.  Students in the 
Emerging level require 360 minutes, with a minimum of 180 in an integrated setting and 90 in a standalone setting.  Students 
in the Transitioning level require 180 minutes, with a minimum of 90 in an integrated setting.  Students in the Expanding level 
require 180 minutes in an integrated setting.  Lastly, students who scored in the Commanding level will receive 90 minutes of 
support in either a standalone or integrated setting. The school currently needs 2 licensed ENL teachers to serve our ENL and 
we have one ENL teacher.  Their programs were created so that each child received te mandated number of instructional 
minutes according to their proficiency levels in each program model.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Students receive targeted instruction in the content areas of Literacy, Math, Social Studies, and Science in connection to the 
themes and topics taught in the mainstream classroom in English. Partnerships and small group instruction is used to provide 
instruction to students. To meet the demands of Common Core Learning Standards, teachers scaffold their instruction by 
modifying lessons and assignments, providing visual aids, prompts, and reviewing vocabulary related to the content. 
Technology such as computers are used so students can have access to information, and get practice listening and reading 
books at their own level and pace. Students also utilize school purchased Internet programs such as IXL for math and science 
practice and MYON for reading practice.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

            
 ENL's are appropriately evaluated in their home language with the three different kinds of assessments throughout the 
year.  Translated, adaptation and parallel development assessments are used to help.  
   
(cid:160) 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

If a student is identified as SIFE, he/she is paired with a higher level student to work as a team to ensure his/her academic 
language development.  Newcomers are paired with a long-term ELL for support.  This buddy system for all students create a 
teaching/learning atmosphere in which each individual can benefit and learn. Technology is used to differentiate instruction. 
Students use computers to listen to stories being read to them. They can alos read along with the stories. Translation apps are 
used to help students express themselves. Students visit IXL and MYON to complete skills that are tailored to their levels. 
Teaching based on prior knowledge and cultural experiences help by relating this knowledge to academic learning in a new 
language and culture.  At the same time, they are developing language awareness and critical literacy.  Former ELLs continue 
to receive additional balanced support and would flourish more in an integrated setting, where they can practice language and 
sharing ideas with students in their grade level.  Both whole class instruction and one-to-one intervention is provided to all 
ELLs, with more one-to-one focused towards SIFE and newcomers.  Differentiation is also provided by adding visuals to teacher 
modeling of the lesson.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Read aloud and shared reading strategies such as retelling, annotation, and stop and jot; visual aids like charts, picture books, 
youtube videos and focusing prompts are used to help support ELL-SWDs. Graphic organizers such as Thinking maps are useful 
because they allow students to organize their thoughts.  ELLS-SWDs also have a better understanding when the teacher 
models paragraph structure in writing. Teachers utilize partnerships and small groups to assist students in learning the 
content.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
A tiered system of instructional support based on demonstrated needs of the student is tailored for every SWD 
student.  Students with special needs receive all related services as per their IEP by a cooperatively working team of 
teachers.  Instruction for ELL-SWDs is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level.  If their scores indicate the need for more 
targeted and intensive support, they move to Tier 2 and Tier 3.  As students' assessment data indicates a significant progress, 
the extra support is removed.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Content-based ESL is not only important for developing academic  language skills, but is also inherently more interesting 
to ELL students than classes that focus on language only. Content areas present numerous topics related to a variety of 
personal interests. In content area ELLs learn to use information in a variety of ways, including oral and written observation, 
description, classification, interpretation, and evaluation. Reference literature, dictionaries, computer technology provide 
extensive hands-on and interactive experiences for ELL students that goes beyond the acquisition of subject-specific 
vocabulary and factual knowledge. ELL students observe the teacher explaining and modeling the strategy, and they are 
given  opportunities to practice the strategy with ordinary classroom tasks. The teacher advises students on how they can 
apply the same strategy across curriculum and in different learning situations.  ELLs learn to apply the skills they learned to 
understand, discuss, read about, and write about the concepts developed. Content teaching provides a context for teaching 
students learning strategies that can be applied in the grade-level classroom. ELLs are provided with hands-on and cooperative 
experiences, lesson topics are linked to student's prior knowledge, students are taught to use technical vocabulary appropriate 
for the content subject, the teacher addresses different student learning styles, students are taught to "know when they don't 
know" -  and what action to take.  They are provided with books, articles, and other resources on content area topic and they 
learn how to use them.  
Additional instruction is provided in the classroom as well as in a separate setting by the RTI teachers team.

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

N/A 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
At this point, PS80 does not offer any after-school programs specifically for ELLs. We have a Push and a 
AIS afterschool program. These programs are open to any students who meet the criteria. For our push program students have 
to be a level 2 in ELA. For our AIS program students cannot be higher than a level 1. Cooperative and hands-on group activities 
prove to be effective in providing ELL students with experiential learning opportunities.  ELL students have access to a variety 
of consent resources in the classroom.  Grade-level books, library books, articles, pictures, software are used by ELLs as a 
reference tool as they work on projects and reports.  They learn how to locate specific information in resource materials even 
if their ability to comprehend the entire text is limited.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary.

have access to computers in their classroom and all students in grade K-2 have access to iPads and the computer lab.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language is supported through the building up on their prior knowledge and culture to help foster overall language 
acquisition.  ELLs are provided with reading materials in their native language.  ELL-SWDs receive additional help from 
paraprofessionals who speak their native language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The state standards for each grade level is used to plan our school curriculum map that ensures we are teaching students what 
they need for the grade they are on. ENL teacher also collaborates with and is a part of grade team meetings and is aware of 
what is appropriate for the grade and age of the students.  Teachers keep in mind the ELLs' age, interests, and reading abilities 
to make sure that the reading and writing materials they choose give students "a reason for turning pages" .  Some materials 
are aimed to extend a student's reading skills, and thus being a little ahead of the student's reading ability. Others intend to be 
a part of an up-to-level reading program that builds bridges into the text and enables students to read fairly independently 
(leveled books, genre types, etc). 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
P.S. 80 does not offer programs before the beginning of the school year. During the school year our Guidance counselor and 
parent coordinator hold workshops for parents and students to learn the rules and procedures of the NYC DOE school system. 
Teachers hold parent teacher conferences on Tuesdays parent engagement time to discuss students progress and provide 
resources to parents on how to support their child.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

P.S. 80 only offers an integrated push-in and standalone pull-out ENL program. Parents are advised on other programs in the 
District and Region and the ways to accommodate their children's language needs  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
We have one full time ENL teacher for the 17-18 school year. We require another part time ENL teacher and are currently 
looking to fill this position. Our ENL teacher participates in professional development in school focused on formative 
assessment and at outside professional development that are listed in the P weekly and teacher's page. Our ENL teacher also 
attends professional development offered through the Borough Support centers. She also participates in teacher teams on 
Tuesdays. Professional development offered through the teacher page focuses on alignment with multiple entry points, 
differentiation of learners, and UDL.  
  
    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our ENL teacher attends off-site professional development that are tailored to ELLs.  Our ENL teacher Turn keys the 
information that is learned from those workshops to our teachers through in school professional development and teacher 
team meetings meetings.    
  
   
  
  
   
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At P.S. 80 staff and the ESL department make sure that no parent of an ELL student is left behind or has little or no 
understanding of the procedures and events taking place at school since parent involvement is an indispensable part of their 
child’s success. On Tuesday's parent engagement time meetings are held with parents to discuss their child's progress. Reports 
are also sent home to parents in their native language to provide them with information on their child. Parents are invited to 
coffee and conversations with the principal where they are provided with updates.  Parents participate in Open School events, 
PTA Meetings and workshops. Translation is provided by In-house staff interpretation and translation services which provide 
parents with instant access to information about their child’s educational options. This makes parent involvement possible 
thus helping to increase parents’ capacity to improve their child’s achievements.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
ELL parents attend  orientation, parent engagement Tuesdays, parent workshops such as parenting 101, Getting ready for the 
test and helping kids get organized, and PTA meetings.  Our ELL parents also attend shows and events such as Dads and 
Daffodils, Grandparents day and Open school week  that are organized by our Parent coordinator and PTA.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kersandra Cox, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During registration parent are asked to complete a home language survey. If they put anything other than English 
the ENL teacher or Supervisor sits and meets with the family to speak about ENL service and schedules a parent 
orientation. The Pupil Personnel Secretary has access to all the ATS reports and gives these report to the part time 
ENL teacher when requested. The Emergency Contact forms are filled out for each of our students at the 
beginning of the school year or at registration. The cards are housed in the main office for staff to access when 
necessary. The school completes the City wide school survey and surveys are given at some specific parent 
workshops. ENL workshops are help during parent engagement time on Tuesdays from the ENL teacher. We 
currently have 18 ENL students in the building.
