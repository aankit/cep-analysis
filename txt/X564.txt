Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of Claremont IHS is to build upon the diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds of ELLs in New York City 
to create a stimulating, academically rigorous and nurturing learning community that prepares students for success in 
college and beyond. Our students cultivate intellectual curiosity, advance critical thinking skills and develop empathy 
as global citizens through the integration of language in all classes.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Claremont International High School (CLIHS) opened its doors in the Fall of 2012 to meet the academic and social 
emotional needs of English Language Learners (ELLs) in the South Bronx. For the 2018-19 school year CLIHS is 
projected to enroll approximately 370 students, who originate from 25 different home countries.  

In addition to our partnership with the Internationals Network, CLIHS engages in strategic collaborations with the 
following community based organizations to support student achievement and family engagement: 

  ● College Now-Hostos Community College 
  ●  New Settlement 
  ● French Heritage Program 
  ● Wingspan 
 
 
 

Institute for Student Achievement 
Sauti Yetu 
 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

To successfully serve our students, CLIHS follows the approach of the Internationals Network for Public Schools , 
which employs interdisciplinary, collaborative, and experiential learning along with key organizational features to 
foster language acquisition and academic growth. The key components of the Internationals Approach to serve our 
ELLs including newcomers, SIFE, Long Term ELLs and ELLs with IEPs include: 

● Heterogeneity and Collaboration : Students work in small cooperative learning groups that build on the diverse 
linguistic, academic and social strengths of every individual in the school community. 

● Experiential Learning : Students are motivated to pursue an area of interest and continue to develop language and 
content area knowledge through real world applications. In reflecting on the experiences gained through internship 
and service learning, students enhance their capacity to successfully participate in their community and build strong 
applications for college. 

● Language and Content Integration : Language skills are best fostered through language rich interdisciplinary study. 
When language skills are embedded in context, content area knowledge is reinforced through students’ need to use 
language to explain content. 

● Localized Autonomy and Responsibility: At every level of a learning community, faculty, students, and community 
partners are encouraged to make informed decisions about their work. This raises the level of individual and group 
accountability and therefore the entire community is motivated to contribute to their fullest potential. 

● One Learning Model for All: The model and structures for faculty development that maximize an environment of 
peer learning and support mirror the model for student learning.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Strengths: Our defined learning approach, which is rooted in the Internationals Approach, supports a culture where 
both student and faculty collaboration is valued. In addition to our interdisciplinary teams, we have established other 
teacher teams to support distributive leadership including a steering committee composed of team leaders and a 
professional development committee that is open to all faculty. Finally, the integration of English language and 
content across disciplines has contributed to students’ progress as measured on the NYSESLAT exam, most notably 
amongst our Long Term ELL population.  

Challenges: During the 2017-18 school year we transitioned to a mastery based grading system to better support our 
portfolio- based assessment system and the instructional shift that requires. Moreover, with over 30% of our students 
identified as having interrupted or lack of formal education (SIFE) , we constantly are refining our project based 
learning curriculum to insure that we best meet the diverse needs of our students. Through our annual 11th grade 
internship program, we continue to build and expand community partners. We continue to build and refine systems 
and structures to support students’ positive transition to post-secondary success. Finally, given our students’ diverse 
immigration narratives, we are developing a wide range of social emotional supports to aid in in their positive 
transition process.  

Finally, as a school community while we recognize our students’ English language growth as a strength, we also 
acknowledge that to insure students are college ready and that students meet graduation requirements, we are 
focused on building teacher capacity to plan and effectively execute inquiry based units of study that culminate in 
graduation worthy portfolio projects. Our instructional focus for the year will continue to focus on the development 
of projects with a particular focus on revision.

Support for school supplies; emergency supplies as needed; counseling provided by social worker; referrals when 
needed to outside agencies; We group students heterogeneously across classes and academic interventions are 
designed to meet the differentiated needs of our ELL students. All students in grades 9-11 receive small group 
instruction in either literacy or math, which offers an additional academic support for students to progress and meet 
graduation requirements. Lastly, our afterschool programs are open to all students. Title 1 and Title III funds also 
support positive academic, linguistic and social progress for all our students, but especially for our overage under-
credited student subpopulation through funding a variety of extended day programs. .

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 09X564, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Claremont International High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
             
Claremont International High School implements a content-based ESL program for our 
heterogenous population of ELL students. Teams of teachers (five per team) design and 
implement standards-based, interdisciplinary, project-based curricula for their students. All 
classes are taught in English, following the Internationals Network model of content and 
language integration. Teachers in all content areas are trained to incorporate ESL methodologies 
and strategies for language acquisition and development. All ESL teachers are fully licensed and 
content teachers receive more that 10 hours of ESL training annually.  
Through the direct instruction supplemental program, ELL students have the opportunity to 
enhance their English through participation in language-rich extra-curricular programs designed 
to meet their unique linguistic needs, while allowing students to explore their interests and 
talents. The direct instruction supplemental program will begin the 3rd week in  October 
(October 17th) and end on June 7, 2017.  Program offerings include Academic English 
expression/speaking,  Student Government, Words as Art, and Academic Enrichment. All 
programs place particular emphasis on the development of ELLs' speaking skills and in targeted 
skill development in literacy and numeracy. These programs are held before and after school to 
maximize opportunities for student participation. The supplemental instructional program serves 
ELLs in 9-12h grade who score at all levels of the NYSESLAT from entering to commanding. 
Subgroups of students to be served include our SIFE population, long-term ELLs and ELLs with 
special needs. All supplemental programs are taught in English by ESL-certified teachers or are 
content area teachers, who have been trained in the Internationals Approach that targets 
instruction for ELLs. Our ENL teachers work in collaboration with content area teachers   . The 
program includes 3-4 ENL certified teachers (Nancy Martin, Wandaly Rentas, Caroline Sykora, 
and Marc McEwan). Our ENL teachers collaborate in planning and implementation of programs 
alongside content area teachers to provide fully integrated language and content support for 
ELLs. 
After School Student Government: 15-20 student government participants work afterschool on 
student-developed and student-led committees. The after school student government program 
improves students' language and literacy through dialogue facilitation. Drawing upon their 
learning from US and Global History classes, students engage in problem-solving and 
presentation. The program is taught by an instructor dual-certified in Social Studies and ESL. 
The class meets weekly on Wednesdays from 3:20 - 4:30 for a total of 30 sessions. The group 
targets intermediate-advanced level ELLs. The language of instruction is English. Materials 
include primary source documents, primarily newspapers and magazines. Student Government is 
facilitated by ENL certified teacher, Timothy Ross.  
Words as Art: 15-20 students participate in the Words as Art program that combines both visual 
arts and creative writing. The program meets on Wednesdays from 3:20 - 4:30 for a total of 30 
sessions. It is taught by  a visual arts certified teacher. The class allows a heterogenous 
population of ELLs to engage in art as a means to further develop this their English writing 
skills. The language of instruction is English. Art supplies will complement art history texts and

As an outcome of the course, the students will produce an exhibition of writing and artwork.  
Academic Enrichment through Math and EnL: A math-certified and EnL-certified teacher co-
plan this program that focuses on targeted literacy and numeracy development for beginner level 
ELL students as well as SIFE. (Charles Jones and Wandaly Rentas) The class provides 
supplemental small group instruction for 10-15 ELL students. It meets Thursdays from 3:20 - 
4:30 for a total of 30 sessions. The language of instruction is English. Materials include teacher-
created materials as well as BrainPop online subscription program.  
Academic Enrichment in Science and Social Studies : All ELLs are invited to participate in the 
Academic Supplemental program. Approximately 50 ELL students/week participate, from 
grades 9-12. The Academic Enrichment Science class is co-planned by a Science-certified 
teacher, a Social Studies certified-teacher and ENL-certified teachers. (Tamanna Talukder, Sara 
Said, Wandaly Rentas) The program offers ELLs the opportunity to receive additional 
instruction in each of the core classes offered at Claremont to ensure that these students have 
increased interaction with course material to deepen their learning. The program is available on 
Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 3:20 - 4:30 for a total of 90 sessions. The language of 
instruction is English. Materials: leveled informational trade books, BrainPop online program, 
and other Internet resources. 
  
Academic English Speaking/Presentation: 
15-20 beginner-intermediate ELLs in grades 9-12 participate in the Academic English Oracy 
class taught by an EnL-certified teacher and content area teachers.   This class offers additional 
structured opportunities for students to develop academic language in English. As a portfolio-
based school, students are required to present their portfolios to a panel as part of their 
graduation requirement. Their presentations also include a question and answer session where 
panelists question students about their projects. The Academic English  program targets the 
language skills necessary for students to engage in academic discussions in English. The 
program meets on Mondays and Thursdays from 3:20 - 4:30 for a total of 60 sessions. The focus 
is on ELA and Social Studies. The language of instruction is English. Materials include

providing PD on the integration of language and content for English Language Learners.  
 
Title III professional development will be included in the Tuesday PDs from 3:00 - 4:20 for the 
school staff since all of our staff works with ELLs. Our professional development is focused on 
improving the academic achievement of all ELLs and providing expanded learning opportunities 
for them including the following topics:   
     
       -Project based learning for ELLs  (Rachael Horowitz, Nancy Martin Literacy Coach and PD

  Our Student Student Support Team is responsive to the needs of our parents , who are all 
parents of ELLs .  The Parent  Coordinator, Carmen Houston and /Social Worker Judi Perez 
conduct a needs assessment to determine which CBOs to invite and which topics to cover at 
parent meetings  pertaining to ELLs .  All information sent to parents regarding said meetings is 
translated and translators. Parent outreach is made through individual phone calls, robo-calls, 
mailings, and back-packed letters sent home with students. Translation 
services are  made  available during the meetings.  School Messenger automatically telephones 
parents in their native language to remind and inform parents of meetings. 
 
Parent meetings  are specifically designated for ELL parents, as all students in the school are 
ELLs. The dates for PA meetings will be held on the 1st Wednesday of every month  for 1 hour. 
 Some parent meetings/workshops are also held in the morning to meet the scheduling needs of 
as many families as possible.  
The meetings are facilitated by the, Parent Coordinator Carmen Houston, Social Worker 
Judilcia Perez, and Principal or Assistant Principal. Outside providers include local CBOs, city 
agencies and locally elected officials.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data indicate that _____% of our incoming 9th grade ELLs are testing as Beginners. This data is used to 
inform our curriculum, instructional approaches and interventions.   We also use teacher-created assessments to provide us 
with each student's grade level in reading comprehension, writing, speaking and listening skills.  The results offer a breakdown 
of specific areas of strengths and weaknesses, so we can gear our instruction toward helping the student in areas of academic 
need and tailor extra help specifically geared to those students.    The teacher made assessments allow us to assess student's 
decoding skills, vocabulary and comprehension.  The results of these assessments are shared with our content area teachers, 
who also focus on developing students'  reading and writing skills across the content areas.  Through this consistent 
reinforcement of reading and writing in their classes and in our after school and Saturday programming, students will see an 
improvement in their scores over time. Additionally, our ESL team is currently preparing to administer  Benchmark assessment 
which will provide Fountas and Pinnell equivalents. While we will have identified student literacy levels, students will continue 
to be grouped heterogenously; however, more targeted interventions can occur.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Interdisciplinary team and content teams 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our program is measured through the analysis of a wide array of data sources, including: 
•     Graduation rate 
•     Course pass rate 
•     Regents pass rate: ELA and Math (Part of the ELL Waiver variance) 
•     Attendance rate 
•     Learning Environment Survey-student results 
•     Learning Environment Survey -parent results 
•     Learning Environment Survey-teacher results 
•     Drop out rate 
•     College Now Participation and applicable course passage rates 
•     Portfolio passing rate

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

interdisciplinary team meetings, content team meetings, steering committee to review 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We are still awaiting our 2016-17 scores that are aligned to the newest ELL designations.  After having only 2 graduating 
classes, one pattern that we are beginning to identify is an alignment between those students in her a commanding on the 
NYSESLAT have a higher passage rate on the ELA Regents.  However, given that  nearly 2/3 of the school population are 
entering as 'beginners' or at the entering level we project that students will advance in proficiency level with the consistent 
application of the INPS principles.  Other initial observations include:  
a) Our student population is heterogeneous in terms of English language ability; 
b) Students across all four grades show growth or progress from the entering level.  
c)Our students, who entered our school as LTEs have progressed at least one whole performance level with more than 1/2 of 
the LTEs earning proficiency.    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

interdisciplinary team meetings and steering committee 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

a. Instruction at our school is delivered collaboratively by teams of four to six teachers who work to plan instruction 
for groups of approximately 75-100 students.   
   b. Our school uses all of these program models.  Each group of students is block programmed and those students 
travel  
together throughout the day.  Within their blocks, 9th and 10th grade students are mixed, as are 11th and 12th grade 
students for math.  The blocks are heterogeneous but at various times teachers may choose to group students within 
the block homogeneously for small group instruction or within heterogeneous classes for targeted interventions.   
c.  Integrated and Standalone ENL are implemented:  Beginning/Entering students will receive a minimum of 540 
minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 180 
minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging will 
receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content 
area.  Intermediate/Transitioning will receive 180 ENL minutes per week which consists of 90 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). 
Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week which consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
or other content area.  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each 
week which consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

Paste response to questions here:    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

              As per the CR Part 154 requirements, beginning September 2017, students will be carefully programmed to receive the 
mandated ENL and ELA instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Beginners/Entering students will receive a 
minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
and 180 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging will 
receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA  and 
90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area.)  Intermediate/Transitioning will receive 180 
ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone 
or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week (this 
consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former 
ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  
We have a series of delivery models to ensure that each student receives these mandated ESL and ELA minutes through 
discrete ESL classes as well as many classes taught by dual certified ESL/content area teachers. (ie: teachers who have dual 
certification in both ESL and a content area such as ESL/English, ESL/Social Studie.) Each instructional team includes at least 
one teacher who is licensed in ESL; in addition, all of our content area teachers are trained in language development and ESL 
methodologies and encouraged to pursue ESL certification.  The school schedule and teacher programming ensure that all 
entitled ESL students receive the mandated number of minutes required according to CR Part 154.  In addition to our regular 
content curriculum all ELL students are given extra ESL instruction in order to meet the number of minutes they require of ESL 
instruction each week. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

      All students take math, science, social studies, and ESL and/or English every year.  Although the language that teachers use 
to communicate with the whole class is English, the language of instruction for specific projects and on any specific day is 
collaboratively determined – students use both English and their native languages to explore content and the locus of control 
for language is student-driven by the content and the students’ needs. 
  
Instruction is not uni-directional from teacher to student in our school.  Students work in groups to complete collaborative 
project-based tasks that both develop language and content knowledge.  Tasks are all common core aligned (as indicated in 
our teachers’ curriculum maps) and designed to be engaging and relevant to students’ lives as well as to build students 
content and language abilities and understanding.    Administrative observations and New York City Writing Project 
coaching/feedback  ensure that the ELL accommodations are effectively implemented by all classroom teachers. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Native language screeners are used when possible to evaluate ELLs in their native languages.  With approximately 10+ 
different languages spoken by our student population, many of our ELLs speak languages for which screeners are not available, 
so we rely on student peers, parents and community partners to provide feedback on native language projects.  
        During the 10  th   grade year students complete a Native Language Portfolio and Presentation.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a)     Instructional plan for SIFE Students: 
All students who are identified as SIFE students (Students with Interrupted/Inconsistant Formal Education) are  placed in our 
extended day SIFE  program where they receive additional support in English literacy and numeracy. They are also placed in a 
distinct Small Group Instruction (AIS) 3x a week for 45 minutes during the regular school day where additional literacy 
supports in both the NLA and English are targeted.   
  Over the past two years with FSF (embedded SIFE funding) and Title III money we program an 8  th   period classroom 
readiness and  literacy program for targeted 9th grade students.  
Our SIFE interventions also draw heavily on our school wide instructional model.  
•     Scaffolding students’ work in regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by developing collaboration 
between the ESL teacher and content area teachers to generalize and practice newly learned skills and strategies across a 
variety of settings.   
Finally  we were able to increase specific social emotional supports for the students including an in school drumming program 
during lunch time facilitated by Wingspan and a social emotional leadership group led by Sauti Yetu. 
  
b)     Instructional Plan for Newcomer ELL Students: 
Newcomers to the school, along with their parents, meet initially with school based staff including the team's ESL teacher, who 
assess their needs and academic development during intake.  All new students and their parents receive an orientation 
developed by the guidance staff along with the parent coordinator.  All students new to the United States and to NYC are given 
the NYSITELL exam which assesses the students English language abilities.  For students transferring in from NYC schools, test 
results are reviewed and students are then matched with teams of teachers who it is felt would best meet the needs of the 
specific student.  Students are placed in appropriate classes according to their specific needs.  The teachers meet in team to 
discuss the specific needs of all new students.  A plan is formulated to best meet the needs of each particular student. 
  
c)     Instructional Plan for Developing ELL's: 
The plan for developing ELLs receiving  service for 4-6 years consists of ongoing support and mentoring. ELLs with 4-6 years of 
service are placed in appropriate classes to best meet their needs and continue their English language development.  Their 
teachers meet regularly in teams to discuss the needs fo the specific students.  A plan is formulated and updated regularly to 
meet the needs of each student.  ELLs who are receiving service for 4-6 years receive a full program and receive all the same 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

support structures as the rest of our ELL populations.  Struggling ELLs who are receiving 4-6 years of service are encouraged 
and often mandated to avail themselves of all the extra support opportunities provided to all the students at large.  This help 
takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework help, the Saturday literacy program 
as well as a variety of other activities.  ELLs with 4-6 years of service are encouraged to try to take some college classes to help 
them to begin the transition towards college life.  These ELLs with 4-6 years who meet regularly with their guidance counselor 
and teachers on their team to receive support and feedback to help assess in their language development. 
  
d)     Instructional Plan for Long Term ELL's: 
The plan for long term ELLs consists of ongoing support and mentoring.  Long term ELLs continue with a full program whether 
they are with us 5 or 6 years and retain all of the same support structures in place for the entire student 
population.  Struggling long term ELLs are encouraged to take advantage of all extra help opportunities provided to the 
students at large.   This extra help takes the form of one-on-one mentoring, small group instruction, after school homework 
help, writing center as well as a variety of other activities.  Whenever possible, long-term ELLs are encouraged to begin taking 
college classes to help them to begin the transition towards college life.  International High School long term ELLs regularly 
begin taking remedial college classes.  All long term ELLs in college classes receive support from a high school teacher mentor. 
  
e)     Instructional Plan for Former ELL's up to 2 years after exiting ELL status): 
As students reach proficiency and test out through the NYSESLAT assessment, they continue to receive a full program of ESL 
services to support and provide for their continued academic growth and development of English proficiency.   Students 
receive higher levels of project opportunities and also have the opportunity to take college classes in any of their academic 
areas.  Students who are determined to have reached proficiency continue to receive support from their teachers as 
needed.  Former ELLs continue to receive the mandated testing accommodations after they they have tested out on the 
NYSESLAT exam. All former ELLs  also receive senior mentoring during their 12th grade year.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Instructional strategies and grade level materials used to provide ELL-SWDs access to academic areas and accelerate English 
language development: 
The Special Education teachers and School Implementation Team review all IEP’s for ELL-SWD’s to ensure that all IEP mandates 
are being met and to ensure that the ELL-SWD student receives the appropriate program in the least restrictive 
environment.  After reviewing the mandates of the IEP, the full team of teachers meet with the Special Education teacher to 
discuss specific instructional strategies that would prove valuable to the growth of the ELL-SWD student and follow the 
mandates of the IEP.  If additional support is needed the student is provided with additional support services as per the IEP.   
The ELL-SWD students who may have learning needs undiagnosed in their home country, have been here a short time and are 
only beginning to learn English, and/or have experienced serious disruptions and inadequacies in their earlier academic 
preparation are addressed by creating instructional opportunities geared to their needs. Students with Individualized 
Education Plans (IEP's) receive full support from the instructional teams to which they belong. Those students are included in 
general education classes. At weekly meetings, the teachers of our instructional teams meet to review the progress of these 
and other students. Teams of teachers along with the guidance counselors meet regularly throughout the semester to review 
the progress of each student in accordance with their specific IEP. 
Some of the specific instructional strategies for ELLs depending on the requirements of their specific IEP’s include: Teachers, 
guidance counselors and special education teacher meet regularly to discuss the individual needs of the ELL-SWD 
student.  Once students have been identified as ELL-SWD and a program has been established following the mandates of their 
IEP, the challenge is to find ways to teach the student the skills they require while also teaching the student to read, write and 
speak English and acquire content knowledge when they may have limited, if any academic skills, have specific disabilities as 
described in their IEP and may have serious affective issues as well.  In order to service the ELL-SWD student in the least 
restrictive environment, students are mainstreamed into the regular academic class and each team provides extra services: 
including one-on-one work with a paraprofessional, small group instruction and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday 
enrichment program has been established, and changes in student programs are made to allow the student time to meet with 
the necessary special service provider depending on the students specific needs.   
Other strategies include scaffolding students’ work in the regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

developing collaboration between the special education teacher or service provider and the content area teachers.  A team 
teaching approach would be used in which the special education teacher plans with the content area teachers to map out 
strategies an best practices and to access the students strengths and area which still need improvement. 
If necessary, ELL-SWD students are expected to attend extra after school home work sessions and are also enrolled in our 
weekly Saturday Learning Series.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Claremont International High School uses a variety of curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse 
needs of ELL-SWD’s to attain their IEP goals within the least restrictive environment.  Once students are identified ELL-SWD’s 
our challenge is to find ways to teach students according to the mandates of their IEP’s in the least restrictive setting.  The 
team would meet with our Special Education teacher or service provider depending on the needs of that students particular 
IEP in order to determine the best instructional strategies to meet the needs to that student according to their IEP.  In order to 
service students who are struggling, each team has provided extra services:  including one-on-one work with a Special 
Education teacher, small group instruction, and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday enrichment program has been 
established, and changes in student programs have been made.  By adapting curriculum to enable those students to succeed, 
by expanding the time available to team members to work with them individually, they are supported in meeting the 
graduation certification requirements.  Our plan maintains that our future students with IEP’s will receive additional academic 
assistance in accordance with the particular needs of their individualized IEP’s.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All students participate in Small Group Instruction three times per week. These groups are determined by assessment data, 
and are revisited throughout the year in order to best meet students' needs.  Our Small Group Instruction (SGI) focuses 
primarily on literacy and numeracy development for ELL subgroups including SLIFE and long-term ELLs. Additionally, we 
provide native language literacy instruction for Spanish-speaking SLIFE.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year we are pleased to continue to  offer AP Spanish Language and Culture, AP Spanish Lit, AP French,  Spanish for 
Beginners Club.  
Revise accommodations for SWDs for the Portfolio process 
Preparation of the CUNY placement exams 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not have TBE 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
The school offers a robust afterschool program as well as a Saturday learning series.  Our afterschool program allows 
opportunities for ELLs to participate in a variety of programming including, academic intervention, academic enrichment, arts, 
athletics and culture. After school programs are open to all students. Programming includes: English conversation, homework 
help, graduation portfolio support, Regents prep, Yearbook, Culture Clubs, GLOW, Visual Arts, sports teams, and Glee club. 
After school clubs run 4 days per week from 3:30 - 4:30. Saturday programs include  Regents Prep, English Conversation, 
Graduation Portfolio Support, and Physical Education. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
It is the philosophy of the school that classroom teachers are the most knowledgeable as to what instructional supplies will 
benefit the ELL students from all ELL sub-groups in their content area classes.  Teachers work in teams to order classroom 
supplies for the ELL students they have in common.  The teachers in consultation with the colleagues on their team as well as 
in consultation with the schools SIFE teacher and guidance counselors which classroom supplies would be most beneficial to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

the students in all of the schools sub-groups.  Each teacher team selects the instructional material they feel will work best for 
the needs of their individual students.  This helps to best meet the needs of all of our students in the individual sub-groups 
within our school, Newcomers, SIFE, ELL’s 4-6 years, long term ELLs as well as former ELLs.  Each team shares equally in the 
school’s NYSTL funds and chooses for itself how they wish to spend the schools their allotment of funds to best serve their 
individual students in all of their content area classes.  Teachers and students in all ELL-subgroups have access to a huge array 
of novels, textbooks, non-fiction, bilingual dictionaries as well as native language books.  All of the materials are available to all 
ELL sub-groups. 
Teachers are encouraged to attend ENL conferences to share information regarding various texts as well as other teaching aids 
and in addition our teachers work collaboratively to create their own instructional materials.   Teachers utilize computer 
software, maps, the Internet as well as various other forms of technology which helps to maximize instruction in all content 
areas and within all sub-groups.  Teachers in all content area have access to class sets of laptop computers with Internet 
access.   
All students including ELL students in all sub-groups, have access to a variety of technologies including wireless laptop 
computers and iPads.  Students use various web based programs. Other resources available to all students and ELL sub-groups 
include native language texts. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We utilize an ENL program model, with strategic home language support.  We additionally offer French and Spanish after 
school programs as well as AP French and AP Spanish classes to enrich and support the continued development of students' 
home languages.  How students’ home language skills are being used for instructional purposes: 
All our students participate in our language development/ENL program.  All of our classes use the native language to support 
learning.  As described above, the locus of control over language use resides with our students and they use both English and 
their native languages to discover and develop content.  Some projects every year are done in the native languages and in 
English and students are supported in developing their native languages to the greatest extent possible.  Students are 
supported by peers, community partners, family members and/or school personnel. 
  
Native language skills are a valued aspect of all subject area classes.  Students are required to complete a Native language 
project as one component of their graduation portfolio.  This native language project is an informational, communicative or 
creative piece in a language other than English, along with a written explanation of the piece in English. 
    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Our instructional teams meet regularly to ensure that required services and supports correspond to ELLs' age and grade 
levels.  All of the required services for high school-aged ELLs are available to students. We use a wide array of resources in our 
school including teacher-made materials, text books on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large 
variety of non-text hands on materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the 
Internet to access resources.  If a teacher or instructional team is having problems locating published materials that are 
appropriate to the age of the ELLs then the instructional teams work together to create an adapt material which will be 
appropriate to the age level of the ELL.  Our teachers understand the importance of utilizing materials and resources for the 
ELL’s appropriate age level in order to keep them engaged in learning.  In addition, instructional teams are encouraged to 
attend professional development workshops throughout the year in order to help them better meet the needs of ELLs with age 
and grade level appropriate to the content of the classes.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
It is the philosophy of the school that classroom teachers are the most knowledgeable as to what instructional supplies will 
benefit the ELL students from all ELL sub-groups in their content area classes.  Teachers work in teams to order classroom 
supplies for the ELL students they have in common.  The teachers in consultation with the colleagues on their team as well as 
in consultation with the schools SIFE teacher and guidance counselors which classroom supplies would be most beneficial to 
the students in all of the schools sub-groups.  Each teacher team selects the instructional material they feel will work best for 
the needs of their individual students.  This helps to best meet the needs of all of our students in the individual sub-groups 
within our school, Newcomers, SIFE, ELL’s 4-6 years, long term ELLs as well as former ELLs.  Each team shares equally in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

school’s NYSTL funds and chooses for itself how they wish to spend the schools their allotment of funds to best serve their 
individual students in all of their content area classes.  Teachers and students in all ELL-subgroups have access to a huge array 
of novels, textbooks, non-fiction, bilingual dictionaries as well as native language books.  All of the materials are available to all 
ELL sub-groups. 
Teachers are encouraged to attend ENL conferences to share information regarding various texts as well as other teaching aids 
and in addition our teachers work collaboratively to create their own instructional materials.   Teachers utilize computer 
software, maps, the Internet as well as various other forms of technology which helps to maximize instruction in all content 
areas and within all sub-groups.  Teachers in all content area have access to class sets of laptop computers with Internet 
access.   
All students including ELL students in all sub-groups, have access to a variety of technologies including wireless laptop 
computers and iPads.  Students use various web based programs. Other resources available to all students and ELL sub-groups 
include native language texts. 
 
As a campus during the 2016-17 school year our school hosted an ENL intervisitation for other schools.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Meetings with parent coordinator; September orientation facilitated by the interdisciplinary teams 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Claremont International High School awards six high school credits in the student’s native language as per Part 100 of 
Commissioner’s Regulations NYS, Section 100.5. which is based on students previous language experience in their native 
country plus the completion of a native language project as a part of their graduation portfolio. We additionally offer 
Advanced Placement classes in Spanish and in French.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1. Professional Development Plan: 
To achieve our instructional goals and implement our core beliefs, an extensive structure of professional development has 
been developed.  This professional development structure is on-going and fully integrated into our school structure.   
Our entire school is divided into 4 interdisciplinary team learning communities.  The two Junior Institute 9th and 10th grade 
teams are each comprised of five teachers and approximately 90 students.  The Senior Institute includes an 11  th   grade team 
(5 teachers and approximatly 95 students) and a 12  th   grade team (6 teachers and approximately 75 students) All 
interdisciplinary teams meet  3-4 times weekly to plan, develop and implement their curriculum and instruction.  They develop 
and revise curriculum and model collaborative work for their students.  Teachers also meet in cross-team groups to share 
student work and curriculum.  They are also sharing strategies for maintaining project-based curriculum with meeting the 
demands of the Regents exams 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

Each Interdisciplinary Team is represented in 5 school-wide committees: Steering, Advisory, Professional Development, 
Mentoring, and Senior Events.  The Steering, PD, and Mentoring Committees are charged with the implementation of different 
aspects of the school-wide instructional approach to further assist teachers with the implementation of our curriculum.  The 
Advisory Committee and Senior Events Committee allow for open lines of communication between students and staff and 
empowers students to become a partner in planning their educational opportunities.   
In June 2017,  Interdiscplinary Teams collaborated on ideas for the Instructional Focus and Social-Emotional Focus for the 
2017-2018 school year that focused on building student autonomy through mastery based grading.  Our Professional 
Development plan was developed by administration and the PD committee to support faculty in effectively meeting our 
instructional focus:  
In order to assist our teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards we have 
planned to offer the multiple opportunities for professional development throughout the year.  These professional 
development sessions facilitated by fellow faculty members and school administrators.  Topics include:  
-Providing meaningful feedback to students 
-Strategies for Language and Content Integration 
- Response to Intervention 
- multi -session mastery based grading workshops 
-Portfolio Project development norming 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Professional development for all staff at Claremont International High School is geared toward improving ELL academic 
achievement and language development; we build teacher capacity in these areas by a variety of means, including: 
a. Intervisitation: teachers observe each other teach and write reflective letters pinpointing new strategies and techniques 
they have learned as a result. 
b. Conferences: faculty attend a variety of external conferences each year in order to keep abreast of new trends in ESL and 
their content areas. 
c. Q-TEL/OELL trainings:  Our classroom teachers are encouraged to complete workshops with QTEL and other OELL offerings, 
which highlight best practices, like scaffolding and differentiation. 
d. The Internationals' Network for Public Schools New Teacher Summer PD:  This two day workshop introduces new 
International High School teachers to best practices and ESL methodologies. 
All of our teaching staff, which includes teachers who do not hold ESL or Bilingual licenses, are provided with a series of 
professional opportunities.  The professional development program focuses on providing teachers with various instructional 
strategies for teaching English Language Learners.  It also focuses on how to prepare ELLs to meet and exceed the NYC and NYS 
performance and learning Standards.  These professional development sessions are facilitated by fellow faculty members and 
school administrators.  
In addition, our staff participates in the Internationals Network for Public Schools Professional Development workshops: at 
three different points throughout the year our entire staff will meet with their peers from our sister International High Schools 
and attend workshops designed specifically for educators of recent immigrant ELL students.  Topics will include scaffolding 
instruction, differentiation of instruction, ENL methodologies, SIFE students, meeting the affective needs of immigrant 
children, and language development. 
Other members of our non-teaching staff also attend staff development training.  Our school secretaries and parent 
coordinator take part in many of the above mentioned staff development activities along with teachers.  In addition, our 
secretaries attend staff development for secretaries and our Parent Coordinator attends the mandatory two day Respect for all 
Anti-Harassment Initiative to prevent bullying and bias related incidents.  
  
Since all of our staff participates in the above-mentioned professional development opportunities throughout the school year, 
plus many more staff members avail themselves of the professional development opportunities listed in part 2 above, 
everyone receives many more hours than the current 50% mandated total for bi-lingual/ESL teachers. All agendas and sign-in 
sheets for PD (both on-site and off) are kept for record-keeping purposes.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We will hold annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs at least one time during each school year, in addition to the four 
regular parent teacher conferences.  At these meetings teachers will discuss the goals of the program, the language 
development process of the individual student, the language proficiency assessment results as well as the student's language 
development needs in all content areas. 
At this meeting we will have content area teachers, the student counselor, and a school staff member to translate as 
needed.  If no staff member is able to translate than we will utilize the DOE Translation Unit to hold over the phone 
translations. 
CLIHSl has teachers working collaboratively on five interdisciplinary teams.  Each of the teams meet together to discuss 
students' language development and content knowledge progress, language proficiency assessment results and language 
development needs during their weekly two hour meeting. 
Each interdisciplinary team has 40 minutes of their weekly team time to utilize for parent involvement time.  This period of 
time which is within the teacher's contractual day is specifically set aside for meetings with parents of ELL's.   
  
2.  In order to ensure that parent needs are accommodated we will utilize our faculty members in order to make phone calls to 
parents to arrange individual meetings.  When a faculty member is not available to translate we will utilize the DOE Translation 
Unit to ensure that all parents receive information about their individual parent meeting in their native language.  Our four 
interdisciplinary teams as well as our Social-Emotional Learning Team work with parents' schedules to coordinate the best 
time for the individual parent meetings. 
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our Social-Emotional Learning Team, which includes 2 Guidance Counselors, a Social Worker, and Parent Coordinator, and 
college counselor  is responsive to the needs of our ELL families.  The SEL Team conducts a needs assessment to determine 
which CBOs to invite and which topics to cover at parent meetings pertaining to ELLs.  All information sent to parents 
regarding said meetings is translated and translators (staff members and paid translation services) are made available during 
the meetings.  School Messenger automatically telephones parents in their native language to remind and inform parents of 
meetings. Parent meetings are specifically designated for ELL families. Meetings are held during the day and in the evening to 
accommodate the scheduling needs of as many families as possible.  
The meetings are facilitated by members of the SEL Team including guidance counselors, Social Worker, and Parent 
coordinator. Topics at meetings include: college application process specific to immigrant and ELL issues, credit accumulation 
and Regents requirements, resources to support ELL students in the portfolio process. Translation for our ELL families is 
provided by staff. This year, we want to  offer ESL classes for our ELL families.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elizabeth Demchak, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Based on the Home Language Identification Survey, a record of adult preferred languages for written translation 
and oral interpretation are maintained in ATS: (1) Spanish - 73.68%; (2) Arabic - 2.92%; (3) Bengali - 4.09%; (4) 
French - 10.53%; (5) Fulani - 1.17%; (6) Indonesian - .58%; (7) Soninke - 2.34%; (8) English - 4.09%; (9) Twi - .58%. 
Copies of said information are shared with our Secretary, School Social Worker, Community Assistant, principal 
and others.  

All written correspondence between the school and students’ families is provided in the language of their choice, 
which most often is in their native language. As a result, we use the NYCDOE’s internal translation unit to provide 
translations of all school correspondence in Spanish, French, Arabic, and Bengali.
