Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Instructional Focus:  

To engage every student through the strategic development of rigorous, comprehensive, standards-aligned 
curriculum and instructional mapping. 

Russell Sage JHS 190Q serves 1059 students in grades 6, 7, and 8. The school sits in the heart of Forest Hills, a 
culturally diverse community. The student body includes: 32% Asian, 7% Black, 27% Hispanic and 30% White. 
Approximately 6% of our students are English Language Learners. Our special needs population is 8%. Overall student 
attendance is 95%. Teacher attendance is 96%. We are an unscreened middle school. The student population is 
heterogeneously grouped within each grade and supported by a pedagogical staff of 80 teachers. 94% of our staff 
have more than three-years teaching experience and all are certified and licensed. Current CCLS instructional 
programs are aimed at creating a bridge between elementary and high school in helping to prepare our students for 
College and Career Readiness through a variety of experiences. Through on-going professional learning in literacy, 
math, science, social studies and technology, our teachers are kept current on City and State-Wide incentives. 
Effective instruction in all content areas is delivered through the workshop model. The classroom offers opportunities 
for whole class, small group and independent work. Classes which culminate in NYS Regents’ assessments are offered 
in Mathematics (Algebra I), Science (Living Environment) and Social Studies (U.S. History and Government) for all 8th 
grade students. All students are programmed to receive Spanish as their foreign language in 7th and 8th grade with 
an opportunity to take the Language Proficiency Examination in 8th Grade. Russell Sage offers classes in visual arts, 
instrumental music, chorus, and dance. Students are encouraged to continue a sequence in art or music in order to 
audition for specialized high schools. Students who struggle with mathematics are identified through assessments and 
State results and are invited to attend small group sessions led by volunteer teachers on Tuesdays and during the 
school day, as needed. 25-30% of our 8th Grade graduating class receive acceptance to the specialized high schools of 
their choice, ie., Stuyvesant, Bronx Science, LaGuardia Performing Arts, Frank Sinatra, and Brooklyn Tech. In 2017-
2018, 81.8% (335) of our school’s 8th graders earned high school credit in 8th grade.  

Current data for school year 2017-2018 show 61.6% of our students met State standards on the NYS Math Exam. The 
City average was 32% and the District was 52%. 62% of our students met the ELA State Exam. The City average was 
41% and the District average was 51%.  

Current 8th grade data for school year 2017-2018 shows pass rates for the following Regents exams: 

Algebra I: 73% 

U.S. History & Government: 75% 

Living Environment: 81% 

The results above represent the entirety of our grade 8 graduating class and is also representative of the percentage 
of students leaving Russell Sage with high school and/or Regents exam credits 

Additionally, we also offer a variety of co-curricular activities for our students to participate in. They include:

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special populations are our ELL and SWD students. Their current needs are improvement of academic vocabulary and 
initiating higher order thinking questions. All SWDs have specific individualized goals evidenced in their IEPs. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of framework for great schools that we made the most progress over the past year was collaborative 
teachers. This is evidenced by the attainment of our goal last year which was : By June 2017 all students inclusive of 
ELLs, Special Education and Lowest 1/3 students will improve the quality of argumentative writing across content 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

areas by 3% as measured by the spring 2017 MOSL. We did meet this goal and surpassed our expectations through 
carrying out our action plan. Our key area of focus this school year is Rigorous Instruction and Trust.  

Teacher Teams have reviewed and assessed instructional materials, specifically the Expeditionary Learning Modules 
and prior teacher-developed curriculum based on the CCLS explicitly dealing with supporting claims with clear reasons 
and relevant evidence. 

Teacher Teams came together to plan lessons, share best practices and review student work to develop a common 
understanding of what work meets the standard. There were discussions of close readings of informational texts 
during mini lessons. They also created common tasks and assessments to facilitate modifying current instructional 
strategies for claims and counter-claims. 

Along with the above strategies, teacher teams continued and will continue their discussions of counter-claim 
approaches across content in the hopes of supporting each subject area. There will also be opportunity to attend 
District/Central offerings for professional learning as well as opportunities for sharing best practices. A debate team 
was initiated during the 2016-2017 school year and will continue during the 2017-2018 school year to address these 
issues. 

 

Additionally, after an analysis of the NYS Mathematics and ELA assessments we have concluded the following 
standards will be our focus for the 2018-2019 school year:

relationship to supporting ideas; provide an objective summary of the text. 

Writing to Sources: 

R.I.8.3- Analyze how particular lines of dialogue or incidents in a story or drama propel the action, reveal aspects of a 
character, or provoke a decision. 

R.I.8.6- Determine an author’s point of view or purpose in a text and analyze how the author acknowledges and 
responds to conflicting evidence or viewpoints. 

Grade 6 Math Focus Standards: 

6.EE.A.3- Apply the properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions. For example, apply the distributive 
property to the expression 3 (2 + x) to produce the equivalent expression 6 + 3x; apply the distributive property to the 
expression 24x + 18y to produce the equivalent expression 6 (4x + 3y); apply properties of operations to y + y + y to 
produce the equivalent expression 3y. 

6.EE.A.4- Identify when two expressions are equivalent (i.e., when the two expressions name the same number 
regardless of which value is substituted into them). For example, the expressions y + y + y and 3y are equivalent 
because they name the same number regardless of which number y stands for. 

Grade 7 Mathematics Focus Standards: 

7.RP.A.2- Decide whether two quantities are in a proportional relationship, e.g., by testing for equivalent ratios in a 
table or graphing on a coordinate plane and observing whether the graph is a straight line through the origin. 

7.SP.C.5- Understand that the probability of a chance event is a number between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood 
of the event occurring. Larger numbers indicate greater likelihood. A probability near 0 indicates an unlikely event, a 
probability around 1/2 indicates an event that is neither unlikely nor likely, and a probability near 1 indicates a likely 
event.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Russell Sage is dedicated to promoting rigorous instruction to all students. Using our 2018 NYS Assessment data, 
currently 61.6% of our students scored a Proficiency rating of 3 and above in mathematics. Additionally, 62.3% of 
students scored a level 3 and above on the 2018 ELA assessment.  

Separately, 66.7% of our ENL students exhibited progress. 

In grade 8 all students were afforded the opportunity to sit three NYS Regents assessments, Algebra I, Living 
Environment and U.S. History and Government. A total of 324 grade 8 students sat for Algebra I and resulted in a 
passing rate of 73%. In Living Environment at total of 282 students were assessed resulting in a pass rate of 81%. In 
U.S. History and Government, 291 students were assessed and resulted in a 75% pass rate.

Our priority need is to continue to review and amend curriculum maps to give ALL students the opportunity to sit 
Algebra I, Living Environment and U.S. History and Government Regents for grade 8 classes consistent with the 
Chancellor's priority of Accelerated learning and instruction and Advancing Equity. Additional supports will focus 
on our Special Education and ENL students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers will continue to develop and implement rigorous curriculum for all departments with an 
emphasis on increasing academic rigor leading to Algebra I Regents as evidenced by student outcomes of the 
aforementioned NYS regents assessment, increasing the number of grade 8 students graduating Russell Sage with high 
school credits by 10% of current levels.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Initiate administration of pre and post assessments per marking 
period in order to analyze and measure student growth and use 
it to drive instruction, student grouping and amendments in 
curriculum maps. 

 

Professional Learning opportunities will be provided to support 
teachers in planning and utilization of data and goal setting in 
order to support above proficiency students in extending their 
learning. 

With the support of licensed ENL and Special Education teachers 
our curriculum maps will contain multiple entry points for all 
learners as evidenced by student need from data collected on 
department assessments. 

 

Teacher Teams will review and assess instructional materials, 
specifically Expeditionary Learning Modules and prior teacher-
developed curriculum based on the CCLS and will incorporate 
Socratic Method as well as leveled book clubs.. 

The strategies that we are using to address the needs of students 
with disabilities, English language learners, and our Lowest 1/3 
student are the use of graphic organizers, task specific scaffolds, 
guided reading activities, continuity of vocabulary for ELL 
students, State/teacher/student created glossaries are made 
available throughout the year for ELL students. We are also 
offering the Title III after-school program to help students make 
progress on the NYSESLAT. In addition, Tuesdays are available to 
students who need additional AIS support across content areas. 

We bring together our school and our community to support our 
students throughout the school day and beyond by informing 
parents through IO Classroom, telephone and e-mails of our 
expectations, goals, code of conduct, as well as our policy of 
respect for all, and of zero tolerance for bullying. Students will 
develop familiarity and trust for key personnel to address issues 
and concerns. These staff members include guidance counselors,

Part 5 – Progress Monitoring  

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Both at the start and end of each marking period Pre and Post Quarterly Assessments will be employed to monitor 
student progress. These assessments will be created by the assessment team of each subject. Further, assessments 
will be standard aligned so that they will provide actionable feedback when reviewing item analysis. Upon completion 
of analysis, amendments of the curriculum maps will take place addressing areas of need. At the midpoint of the 
school year student will be administered a mock Regents Exam. Results will be correlated and analyzed to provide 
course instruction for the duration of the academic year. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Assessment teams will create subject pre and post assessments on DDC to monitor student progress. Each question 
will be drawn from past Regent Exams and aligned to a standard, which will lead to an item analysis. Upon conclusion 
of the analysis focus standards will be identified, curriculum maps amended and student outcomes will increase. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Russell Sage is dedicated to promoting a safe and nurturing environment for all students and faculty.  

Based on the 2015-2016 Learning Environment Survey, 89% of the students agree or strongly agree that the teaching 
staff helps them approach challenges by suggesting new strategies that they can use. Another strength indicated in 
the survey was that teachers effectively teach the organizational skills and work habits such as note taking and 
keeping track of assignments that students need to succeed in school. 91% of students agree and strongly agree that 
the teaching staff at school helps them reflect on their strengths and learn of areas in which they can improve. 

The survey indicated that 44% of students agree that most students treat each other with respect. However, a larger 
percentage, 56% disagree or strongly disagree. Also, 49% disagree or strongly disagree that most students at the

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, our students will know of at least one staff member that they can trust and be supported by thereby 
creating a positive student culture. This will be evidenced through surveys from students and will result in a 10% 
increase on the learning environment survey question regarding the percentage of students that say teachers notice 
when they are upset or having emotional difficulty.

The culture of the Russell Sage community is to continually 
reinforce the importance of respect within and outside of the 
building. In order to increase student awareness for respect 
throughout the building, we will roll out various programs. The 
Respect For All program encourages the maintenance of safety, 
and a supportive learning environment free from harassment, 
intimidation, bullying and discrimination.  
The Common Sense Program is a program geared for 6 th graders 
with a focus on how to be safe online. Students are made aware 
of the opportunities and pitfalls of the internet/social media. As 
part of the program, students are also taught and reminded of 
the importance of treating others in a respectful manner.  

A focus of the School Counseling Program for individuals and 
groups helps students develop social skills which include 
interpersonal relations, healthy attitudes toward peers and 
adults, and respect for differences of all members of our school 
community. Our SAPIS coordinator visits every class to 
disseminate The Life Skills Program to all grades. This program 
helps students be organized, good decision makers, respectful 
and considerate of others, whether adults or peers. The Deans 
will address social attitudes during student assemblies on a 
weekly basis beginning in September 2017. Here respect for all 
will be targeted as well as language from the school survey to 
empower students to have their voices heard.

student engagement, student discussion and student assessment. Parents will identify and be provided with scaffolds 
to assist their children at home. Also, each month Russell Sage send home a parent newsletter to keep students 
informed of topic in each subject, CEP goals with progress included and continued parent workshops sponcered by 
our parent coordinator.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
In February 2019, teachers will administer an in-house, Mock Learning Environment survey to check for overall 
comprehension and the success of ongoing Respect For All programs. Upon analysis by administration and SLT, re-
teaching/reinforcement of deficient items will be re-addressed through school programs. The results of this 
benchmark will be correlated and aligned to the pubic NYC School Survey to assess progress. To assure the 
benchmark assessment is accurate, we will utilize the same questioning used in the original survey.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
The specific instrument utilized will be a school created Learning environment survey.  

 

Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After analyzing multiple data sources including the NYC School Survey, internal staff surveys, Advance data, the 
determination was made to set a goal to increase professional learning opportunities for teachers. In the most recent 
school survey regarding rigorous instruction, when asked "Overall, my professional development experiences this year 
have: 

 

been sustained and coherently focused, rather than short term and unrelated: 42% responded in disagreement 

included opportunities to work productively with teachers from other schools: 64% responded in disagreement 

 

We are in the process of building curriculum development teams comprised of teachers. Teachers have volunteered 
to lead their own teams in professional learning with the focus of identifying best practiced WITHIN the school. Our 
staff members are attending the Teacher Leadership Program Based on this training, the teachers will be able to lead 
teacher teams in ELA, Social Studies, Math, and Science on Monday afternoons. Another cohort of teachers are 
enrolled in Algebra for ALL and lead professional learning specifically for the math team. Another cohort of teachers 
are enrolled in Urban Advantage and lead professional learning specifically for the science team.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By June 2019 we will implement professional learning opportunities and teacher collaboration among 10% of teachers. 
This will be evidenced via Google surveys and the learning environment survey.

Teacher Teams will meet each Monday to collaborate on 
Curriculum Maps, participate in lesson plan studies, share best 
practices and review student work to develop a common 
understanding of what work meets the CCLS.  

Strategies that are being utilized include creating systems to 
bring together our school and our community to support our 
students throughout the school day and beyond by continuing to 
inform parents through Skedula, e-mails, Student Led Parent 
Teacher Conferences on Tuesday, discussions of expectations 
and goals, Respect for All, zero tolerance for bullying, student 
familiarity of key personnel to address issues and concerns. We 
also have guidance counselors, deans, a SAPIS worker, college 
and career readiness activities through school-based activities as 
well as corporate partnerships.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2015-2016 Report Card, parental response to the school survey was only 48% which was below the 
city-wide average of 54%. However, 98% of our students compared with 83% of students city-wide completed the 
survey. We also saw an increase in parent satisfaction in receiving a response when contacting the school.  

Our strengths are that 91% of parents who responded to the survey indicated satisfaction and above with the 
education their children receive. 91% of teachers in this building would recommend this school to parents. 

A weakness indicated by the survey is that only 44% of the students say that most students treat each other with 
respect. Another area in need of improvement is that attendance at PTA meetings dropped from the prior year. Also, 
52% of parents are enrolled in Skedula, our school-wide on-line communication system. Parents also made us aware 
through e-mails and phone calls to the Parent Coordinator that our school web-site needs to be more user-friendly. 
Parents also requested more verbal information as well as written feedback concerning their children as well as 
school-wide activities. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019 J.H.S. 190 will continue to promote family night by showcasing student work and talent. This will be

disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

We will continue parental outreach through e-mails, phone 
conversations, Skedula, PTA and school websites as well as an 
open-door policy enabling parents’ access to teachers and 
guidance counselors for richer conversations about success 
for all students. In order to increase our outreach to our 
diverse population, we will provide translated parent 
literature. Interpreters will also be available during student-
led conferences, IEP meetings, and general meetings with 
staff and administration. 

The Science, Math, Social Studies and ELA departments will 
meet to plan Family STEM night, Family Social Studies night 
and Family ELA night. They will develop a list of activities that 
incorporate topics covered in the listed subject areas. 
Students will lead the hands-on demonstrations. Parents and 
students from our nearby feeder schools will be invited to 
attend.  

The Parent Teacher Association will enhance communication 
between the families and parents by frequent updates to the 
PTA website. The PTA will continue making the site more user-
friendly by posting pertinent information and gathering 
photos and videos of all events taking place at Russell Sage.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Russell Sage JHS 190 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Elementary and Secondary School ESEA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Russell Sage JHS 190 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESEA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary nd Secondary School Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events;

The Title III supplemental instructional program will be conducted by an ESOL K-12 licensed 
teacher and a licensed teacher twice a week after school on Wednesday and Thursday from 2:35 
to 4:05. The program will start October and continue through May 2, 2019. There will be one 
supervisor on site overseeing the Title III program. All English Language Learners (ELLs) from 
grades six through eight are invited to attend. The program is open to all ENL students. 
Enrollment is voluntary. Permission slips are sent home in English, Spanish, Chinese, Russian 
and other available languages two weeks to one month in advance to the first day of the program. 
Signed permission slips from a parent or legal guardian is mandatory for participation. During 
every session,  attendance will be taken to maintain a legal record for the school. A light and 
healthy snack will be provided for all participating ELLs by the school cafeteria every meeting. 
Once registered, it is mandated to attend all the sessions throughout the program.  In case of 
absence, a medical note or other types of proper notes from a parent or legal guardian must be 
submitted to the teacher or supervisor. The materials for the program include Inside Phonics by 
Cengage Learning, Making Connections by Heinle & Heinle, Scholastic Action Magazine, and 
other accompanying digital resources. These materials are focused on developing both social and 
academic language skills for diverse ELLs. The digital resources are ELL-friendly and on-target 
with learning objectives. All four modalities are incorporated into activities, and the activities are 
scaffold to support ELLs with different needs. Throughout the program, the teachers will also 
integrate other available resources as needed. 
Currently there are a total of 106 English Language Learners enrolled in Russell Sage Junior 
High School plus an additional 49  Commanding students entitled to 2 years of continued 
support.  There are 46 ELLs in sixth grade, 30 ELLs in seventh grade, and 30 in eighth grade. 
There are 11 sixth grade, 13 seventh grade and 25 eighth grade Commanding students. Currently 
the data reveals that the majority of English Language Learners are at Expanding level including 
our incoming 6th graders. Out of  current ELLs in the building, 60% of the students are at 
Expanding level. This trend is common in all grades six, seven and eight.  There are  27 6th 
grade,   11 7th grade and 22 8th grade expanding ELLS for all grade levels. There are 
2 Entering/Emerging 6th graders, 5 Entering/Emerging 7th graders and 5 Entering/Emerging 8th 
graders. 10 transitioning 6th Graders,  8 transitioning 7th Graders and 9 transitioning 8th Grade 
students. At this time, the smallest subgroup, Entering ELLs are made up of 2 Entering level 
students or 2%. 
Furthermore, traditionally, the ELLs at Sage are from various cultural backgrounds. The 
languages include Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Burmese, Chinese, French, Georgian, Greek, 
Gujarati Indonesian (Bahasa), Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Malayalam, Mandarin, 
Portuguese, Punjabi, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Tajik, Ukrainian, Urdu and Uzbek. The top three 
home languages are Chinese, Russian and Spanish. Nine (9) students speak Chinese 
(any). Seventeen (17) speak Russian. And thirty-four (34) students come from Spanish speaking 
households. Nevertheless, Sage is a school of multiculturalism.  
The participating ELLs will be divided into two groups based on their academic needs 
and  English proficiency. Entering and Emerging ELLs will receive instruction in vocabulary

development across the academic content areas, participating in total physical response activities 
to support students along the stages of language acquisition. For instructional purposes, students 
are partnered according to their native languages to support the use of the primary language in 
learning English. Depending on availability, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries will be 
provided during the program and throughout the year. For the ELLs from Latin native languages, 
the teachers will implement instruction on pointing out overlapping cognates and false cognates 
in clarifying vocabulary meaning. Other group activities for diverse ELLs create an 
educationally sound and safe environment for students to develop and reinforce basic 
interpersonal communication skills through social interactions. Transitioning and Expanding 
ELLs will receive instruction to enhance their academic reading and writing. Since the ELLs 
collaboratively learn with various non-ELLs in the classroom during school hours, it is 
imperative to support ELLs in developing communication skills and academic reading and 
writing skills. Throughout the program, ELLs will be introduced to various social issues and 
current events. This instructional focus will implement critical thinking skills, argumentative 
reading and writing skills, and productive discussion skills. This will also support the ELLs who 
will take the New York State English Language Arts Assessment. These ELLs will be 
heterogeneously grouped to facilitate cross-cultural knowledge and understanding and to develop 
all four modalities of the English language. Students will receive instruction in test-taking 
strategies integrated with TESOL reading and writing strategies such as mind mirrors and 
double-entry journals. All the participating ELLs will continue to develop their academic 
language skills along with social communication skills, which can be applied across content 
areas as they develop these skills. This supplementary program is designed to help students meet 
grade performance standards while providing differentiated instructions attending to the needs of 
all English Language Learners. The Title III Instructional Program promotes English acquisition 
and provides English Language Learners the necessary scaffold to close the academic gap, 
particularly in the content areas. The instruction will provide the necessary language building 
blocks to academic success and prepare students for the NYSESLAT exam which will be 
administered in April and May of 2019..

Begin description here:            
Training sessions will assist all pedagogues to maximize services for the cognitive and academic 
development for all English Language Learners. Russell Sage personnel will continue to take 
advantage of professional learning on the use of  data and promoting academic language across 
content areas to prepare ENL students for New York State assessments throughout the academic 
year. Monday after-school professional learning sessions will take place from 2:35 to 3:35 
periodically throughout the school year as well as individualized co-planning periods. Teachers 
will be encouraged to participate in the professional learnings offered through the Queens South 
Support Center as well as R-BERN/ The presenter of these sessions will distribute agendas and 
have attendees sign an attendance sheet. The agenda and attendance sheet will be stored in the 
main office in a PL binder.  Topics have and will continue to include but are not limited to access 
to SMART Board and Skedula which is our in-school student and parent outreach tool,

Part C: Professional Development  
implementation of technology to develop all four modalities of language, specifically listening 
and speaking. Professional development in navigating SESIS will be provided to assist 
pedagogues in the assessment and tracking of ELL IEP student progress. Hour long professional 
learning, as stated previously, will be provided on the first Monday during the months of 
October, November, December, January, February, March, April, and May. Topics include but 
are not limited to interdisciplinary planning which takes place during common planning time and 
the implementation of the Common Core Standards to further develop academic vocabulary in 
the content areas. Additional professional development opportunities will take place during 
forty-two minute lunch and learn sessions on a needs basis. Teachers of ENLs will continue to 
teach and learn instructional strategies from professional development provided by qualified 
specialists through the New York City DOE Division of English Language Learners Student 
Support Services, our Queens South Borough Field Support Center and others. ELL personnel 
will be offered continued professional learnings in using and interpreting data from various State 
assessments such as MOSL Assessments, New York State Math Examination, New York State 
ELA Examination, New York State Science Assessment, New York State Math, Science and 
Social Studies Regents and the NYSESLAT along with periodic assessments. The know-how of 
navigating exam history, assessment reports and analysis will be the driving force behind 
instructional strategies and decisions for ELLs. The training will include practical application of 
data to assist ELLs' equal participation in literacy, mathematics, science, social studies and other 
subject initiatives with the hope of helping ELL student gain high school credit while in middle 
school. These professional developments will occur in one-hour sessions once a month from 
January to May. In preparation for State assessments, additional Professional Learnings will be 
provided to staff covering text-dependant questions and how to support all ELL middle school 
students. 
The professional learnings focused on data will enable the school to identify and address ELLs 
who are lacking the fundamental language and number sense skills to succeed in reading and 
mathematics. Likewise, these basic skills predict and influence ELLs' success in other core 
subjects such as Social Studies and Science. ELL personnel will be guided through the unique 
challenges ELLs encounter when acquiring academic vocabulary in the content area. Teachers 
will gain insights, practical scaffolds, and research-based strategies that may be implemented in 
the classroom to foster acquisition of academic English that can be used across the content 
domains. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact

The needs of ELL parents are surveyed during the orientation meeting at the beginning of the 
academic year and periodically throughout the year. An invitation is extended the home language 
of all of our parents encouraging them to take a decision making role in the education of their 
child from selecting a language program model to students' participation in after school 
programs.  Meetings are planned specifically for the need of ELL parents addressing common 
questions and concerns regarding service entitlement, understanding State assessment data and 
requirements and available resources. Parents are surveyed in their home language for translation

needs and translators are provided on-site and over the phone to encourage and facilitate parent 
participation in the school community. Additionally, informational fliers regarding school 
functions such as curriculum night and parent/teacher conferences are sent out in multiple 
languages. Translators are on hand during student led conferences to assist parents understanding 
of the curriculum and their child's progress. In order to communicate with a limited English 
proficient parent, teachers have access to over the phone translation services provided through 
the DOE. The Parent Coordinator, Ms. Shoko Obata, is available to provide information 
regarding available services in and outside the school, such as adult ESL courses as per parents' 
requests. Lastly, parents receive emails of school related information in their home language. All 
efforts hope to communicate that school personnel are available to address parents' needs and to 
create a safe and engaging environment for the participation of all, specifically ELL parents. 
Regardless of the types of communication to parents, every effort is made to provide parents 
access to information in the language of their choice. 
<!--{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E--> 
There will be three, two-hour ELL Parent Meetings presented by Ms. Kim, Ms. Restrepo, 
licensed TESOL teachers, as well as Ms. Aulicino, supervisor, during the following months 
addressing the following topics: November - Overview of Academic School Year; February - 
New York State English and Mathematics Tests; April - NYSESLAT and promotional criteria. 
The three ELL parent meetings held are each administered for a two hour period of time by two 
ENL teachers and one administrative supervisor. Fliers for each ELL Parent meeting are created 
with specific agendas: curriculum, learning standards, expectations, State assessments 
(NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, Science, Regents), important dates, testing exemptions and 
accommodations, ELL parent rights, helpful websites, valuable tips for parents, school meetings 
and activities, parent education workshops, ELL parent support services, ELL specific skills and 
strategies, and promotion criteria. Time is allotted during these meetings to address 
parent questions and any items of concern. Translators of various languages are provided for all 
parents during these meetings. 
Fliers are sent out for translation into Spanish, Russian and Chinese as these languages have been 
identified as common languages across the ELLs at Sage. Other languages are requested for 
translation through the Translation and Interpretation Unit based on availability. English and 
translated fliers are printed on pastel colored computer paper given to ELL students enrolled at 
J.H.S. 190, and sent home to parents.  Attendance sign-in sheets are created and remain at the 
front entrance so that parents may sign in immediately before entering the meeting.  Attendance 
sheets include parent name, student name, student class, parent email, parent phone number, 
parent concerns, and parent feedback.  All handouts are given at the start of each meeting which 
include the agenda, forms, brochures, contact information, and helpful resources.  Interpreters 
are seated with parents for translation purposes and are grouped based on home languages and 
availability. Parents are surveyed before the meeting to request necessary interpretation services. 
Food and beverages are provided for parents. Students are welcome to accompany their parents 
during the meeting.  A PowerPoint presentation is created and displayed onto a  SMART Board 
for the whole group to follow along with topics of discussion.  Parents are provided ample time 
to ask any additional questions or concerns.  A copy of all records, including meeting agendas, 
attendance and other handouts, is made and kept in a secure filing location in room 342A. The 
original record of Meeting Agenda and attendance is submitted to the Business Manager, Joanne 
Criscionne- Spaventa, and filed.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The overall data given provides an understanding of the ELL demographics in the building. The assessment tool our school uses 
is the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT.  The NYSESLAT data indicates that we have   current ELLs (including commanding who are 
entitled to 2 years of continued support). These ELLs are comprised of % or   Expanding/Transitioning students and  % or 
Emerging and Entering students. Former ELLs (Commanding) comprise the remaining  % will be supported in linguistics  and 
academics in their transitional stage. Currently there are a total of 111 English Language Learners non Commanding students 
enrolled in Russell Sage Junior High School. There are    ELLs in sixth grade,    ELLs in seventh grade, and   in eighth grade. The 
commanding students are comprised of    6th graders,    7th graders and   8th graders.. The data reveals that the majority of 
English Language Learners are at      level including our incoming 6th graders. Out of 111 current ELLs in the building,   % or 
approximately    students are at Expanding level. This trend is common in all grades six, seven and eight.  There are   6th 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

grade,    in 7th grade and   in 8th grade expanding ELLS for all grade levels. There are   Entering/Emerging 6th 
graders,  Entering/Emerging 7th graders and   Entering/Emerging 8th graders.   Transitioning 6th Graders,  Transitioning 7th 
Graders and   Transitioning 8th Grade students. At this time, the smallest subgroup, Entering ELLs are made up of   Entering 
level students or    %. 
 
This finding leads to our instructional focus which is to concentrate on promoting the Entering and Emerging ELLs to 
Transitioning or Expanding level by the end of the 2017-2019 school years. Learning objectives for Entering and Emerging ELLs 
is to build phonemic awareness and basic vocabulary words in English, to develop clear and cohesive sentence writing skills, 
and to build basic interpersonal communication skills through interdisciplinary learning experience and National Geographic 
Inside Fundamentals on/offline program. The instructional focus for the Transitioning and Expanding ELLs are building 
academic language across the content areas, promoting reading comprehension, and integrating content learning in 
developing complex sentences and essays. Learning objectives for the Transitioning and Expanding ELLs are determined 
periodically based on the critical analysis of the detailed data such as scores in each modality or item analysis, resulting in the 
leveled or flexible grouping based on target skills within the classroom. Item analysis has revealed that long term ELLs and 
special education ELLs share the same needs and intervention services as their Transitioning and Expanding peers. 
Additionally, similar services will be provided by certified special education teachers in accordance with their other mandated 
services and accommodations as outlined by the Individual Education Plans.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The structures in place to support this effort are namely the creation of lesson plans with scaffolds by both content specific 
teachers and/or ELL certified teachers to address the specific academic needs of the various levels of ENL students within both 
the integrated classes as well as stand alone classes. By incorporating ELL strategies, students of all levels in both integrated as 
well as stand alone classes will be supported academically while receiving their mandated minutes.L 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our programs for ELLs is evaluated by the overall numbers of students scoring commanding on the NYSESLAT 
and the overall movement of our ELL population in all modalities and levels. In the beginning of the school year, NYSESLAT 
scores are broken down by modality and are evaluated to see how students performed overall. According to the EDAT, ELLs 
have been meeting and exceeding the baseline targets. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once data has been assessed, we use our Title III after school program which runs twice a week. Fliers are created in English as 
well as targeted languages and handed out to all of our ENL students of all levels. All students are encouraged to attend. 
Phone calls are made to encourage student participation. We also have on Tuesday, teachers from all subject areas, available 
to meet with students from 2:30 until 3:00. Our weekly in-house and monthly parent newsletter advertises our after 
school program and encourages teachers as well as parents to recommend and/or enroll students in the after school program.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The assessments that are utilized to evaluate and inform our ELL programs are the NYSESLAT, the NYS ELA and Math exams. 
Data reveals that there are currently    Entering/Emerging level students as the minority,    Expanding, with  Transitioning 
students and    rated Commanding. There are    Expanding 6th graders,   Transitioning and    Entering/Emerging 6th graders 
plus    Commanding making up  % of our ELL population. There are    Expanding 7th 
graders,   Transitioning,    Entering/Emerging 7th graders plus    Commanding making up  % of our ELL population. There 
are    Expanding 8th graders,   Transitioning,  Entering/Emerging 8th graders and   Commanding making up    percent of our ELL 
population..  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

An ENL team consisting of teachers, guidance counselor, pupil accounting secretary, programmer and an administrator looks at 
compiled data such as NYSESLAT and NYSITELL outcomes to make adjustments of minutes and curriculum/programs in STARS 
Classroom according to CR-Part 154 so that all ELLs have access to content curriculum and ENL strategies and tools needed for 
success. We also address compliance issues which are sent to us periodically via our Borough Support Team. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The organizational and program models depend on the students' English proficiency level determined by the 
NYSESLAT/NYSITELL and their Individualized Educational Plans.  All content area instruction follows a 
departmentalized model (e.g. Mathematics, English Language Arts, Science, Social Studies, and Foreign Language) 
while ENLs follow this model with heterogeneous push-in/integrated.  Students who are on the entering/emerging 
spectrum are programmed into classes receiving content area instruction with non-ENL students and travel together 
as a group as well as being pulled out for ENL specific instruction/stand-alone ENL program to adhere to the CR Part 
154. They therefore have access to both integrated as well as a heterogeneous stand-alone model.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

The majority of students in the 8th grade program are transitioning/expanding and have access to both integrated as 
well as stand-alone ENL instruction. The 8th grade students in the TBE program spend approximately 10% of the 
written instructional time primarily in the home language (Spanish in this case) and 10% of the time verbally speaking 
Spanish.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All ENL students follow a block program, receiving scaffold content instruction with a minimum of five 42 minute periods 
of English from content area licensed pedagogues.  Likewise, ENL-SWD students receive the same content instruction as their 
peers in either an ICT, 12:1, or 12:1:1 classroom setting.  ELLs receive services in both stand-alone heterogeneous block model, 
with a licensed ELL pedagogue providing additional support in content areas such as ELA and Math. ELL-SWDs are serviced 
following a heterogeneous push-in program model in English intensive content areas,  English Language Arts and 
Mathematics.  The mandated number of instructional minutes provided for ENL and ELA (90, 180, 360 minutes) are delivered 
in 42 minute periods per N.Y.S. CR Part 154 for all English Language Learners.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
     All ENL students from grades 6 to 8 are grouped by language fluency and academic proficiency in the content areas. 
Differentiated instruction is delivered in both language and content areas according to the needs for each ELL 
subgroup.  Reading and writing strategies are modeled and implemented to provide ELLs with the necessary language scaffold 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

to close the academic gaps while providing ELLs support to meet grade performance standards in the content areas.  ELLs are 
appropriately evaluated in their native language with the assistance of on-site and phone translation services.  The varying 
needs of Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding newcomers and ELLs who are required to take the ELA state 
assessment are addressed in differentiated instruction.  Entering and Emerging students receive instruction in vocabulary 
development across the academic content areas, participating in total physical response activities to assist and move students 
along the stages of language acquisition.  For instructional purposes, Entering and Emerging students are partnered according 
to their native languages to support the use of the primary language in learning English.  This model creates an educationally 
sound and safe environment for students to reinforce and build social interaction skills. The Transitioning and Expanding 
learners are heterogeneously grouped to facilitate cross-cultural knowledge and understanding and to develop all four 
modalities of the English language.  Similarly, the language skills of Transitioning and Expanding learners are also utilized in 
pointing out overlapping cognates and false cognates in clarifying vocabulary meaning. Test taking strategies are integrated 
with TESOL reading and writing strategies to deliver systematic, interactive, high-challenge, high-support instructions for all 
students due to the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards for ELLs.  The instructional plan is for these ELLs to 
develop academic vocabulary along with their academic writing, drawing heavily on concepts from the content areas.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   All ENL students are appropriately evaluated in their home language with the assistance of on-site and phone translation 
services.  Furthermore, their home language is incorporated whenever  possible as a bridge to facilitate conceptual 
understanding in the content areas and to support progress in English acquisition.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

ENLs receiving four (4) to six (6) years of service and long-term ELLs share the same instructional plan due to their common 
difficulties with reading and writing as opposed to listening and speaking.  Therefore, students will continue to receive 
additional support in both reading and writing modalities from special education and TESOL pedagogues. Long-term and those 
who risk falling into this category also share decreased level of motivation. Therefore, current events, project based learning 
and technology tools with the incorporation of scaffolds are used to motivate these students and continue to accelerate the 
development of reading and writing in the content areas.  These students as well as Former ELLs will continue to receive 
testing accommodations such as bilingual glossaries, native language tests when available in content areas as well as ENL 
services on a needs basis. (All students regardless of language acquisition are entitled to non-timed State ELA and Math Exams. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The varying needs of ENL - SWD who are required to take State assessments are addressed in the differentiation of 
instruction.  Students receive instruction in vocabulary development across the academic content areas, participating in total 
physical response activities to assist and move students along the stages of language acquisition.  Students are partnered 
according to their native languages to support the use of the primary language in learning English. A newly purchased National 
Geographic technology program allows students to have additional enrichment opportunities in reading, writing, listening and 
speaking at home as well as within a classroom setting. These models create an educationally sound and safe environment for 
students to reinforce and build social interaction skills. Furthermore, the curriculum incorporates computer-based activities to 
promote computer literacy for the ELLs with disabilities to provide equal access to all content areas and completion of tasks. 
Students also have use of bilingual glossaries and dictionaries in various languages. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Based on IEPs and teacher recommendation, students are placed in the least restrictive environment.  All programming is done 
to ensure flexibility enabling all students access to all programs.  Within all the contents areas - ELA, Math, Social Studies, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Science, etc. - The same curriculum is taught throughout with modifications and scaffolds to help students achieve success 
across all academic areas. All students have access to sit for the New York State Regents given at Russell Sage - Algebra, U.S. 
History We have the same expectations for all of our students throughout the school community.  Various multiple entry 
points are utilized within the instruction depending on student need. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Intervention for ELLs in math and ELA will be offered during the Title III Supplementary Instruction program, conducted twice a 
week for a total of three (3) hours every week. Attendance for ELLs who scored lower than a level 3 on either the N.Y.S. Math 
or ELA assessment will be highly recommended.  Students will be grouped according to their needs so that pedagogues could 
provide effective intervention instructions. In conjunction with the OELL and STEM, ELLs will also have opportunity to 
participate in other programs offered throughout the building including a Science Olympiad where students work together as 
partners on projects and then these team members have opportunity to compete against other team partners from other 
Middle schools. We also plan to continue our LEGO robotics club. All 6th, 7th, and 8th grade students are invited to join the 
math team. The programs mentioned focus mainly on integrating technology and language to help motivate the ELLs through 
the interdisciplinary topics, promoting inquiry-based critical thinking hands-on activities.  ELLs who have reached proficiency 
on the NYSESLAT will be provided continued transitional support through testing accommodations such as extended time, 
translated test materials and native language glossaries when available.  Teachers will be aware of the status of previous ELL 
students in their classroom and will provide additional language support through the content areas via native language 
dictionaries, glossaries, tests, peer translation as well as outside translation services provided by the NYC DOE.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on Title III funding as well as budgetary constraints, there are no new programs for consideration. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Current programs and services for ELLs will continue for the upcoming year.  No programs or services will be discontinued due 
to their success in promoting academic and linguistic development. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are granted equal access to all school programs and instructional materials including technology.  The majority of our ELL 
population is mainstreamed and experience the same quality of instruction and materials as students whose native language is 
English.  Current ELLs are provided the same learning opportunities as their advanced and native English speaking 
counterparts, with licensed content teachers and the appropriate units of content and language instruction.  As noted before, 
similar to mainstreamed students, many current ELLs and previous ELLs take advantage of after school programs offered 
through school, such as Math Club, Debate Team, Specialized High School Admission's Test and the Beacon Program.  All ELLs 
participate in after school events and programs offered through Urban Advantage parallel to the mainstreamed students. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technology is one tool used to provide curricular and instructional support to meet the diverse needs of all ELLs, including ELL-
SWDs.  Technology (Chrome Books/Laptops) are integrated throughout interdisciplinary project based learning and instruction. 
Students will utilize tools such as Web 2.0 to create educational web pages in a secured environment to allow students to 
showcase their published work and build their sense of achievement.  In implementing additional technology, programs such 
as PhotoStory and MovieMaker, will afford students ample opportunities to maintain and further develop their listening and 
speaking skills in creating a multimedia end product such as slide shows, video clips and short movies.  In creating these 
multimedia projects, students will further develop their reading and writing skills by researching, editing and writing dialogues, 
interviewing, and narratives. The National Geographic Program will also provide web-based assessments and scaffold materials 
in both English and their native language.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All English Language Learners are encouraged to further develop their primary language skills as they strive to acquire the 
English language.  Reading, writing, speaking and listening in the home language is promoted in the classroom to serve as an 
accessible entry point for English Language Learners, particularly in learning concepts across academic areas.  In content 
instruction, English is the dominant language of instruction supported by students’ home language during group work to clarify 
meaning and understanding. Content instruction emphasizes academic vocabulary development in an effort to make content 
comprehensible while supporting language development. Students' prior knowledge is recognized, specifically their home 
language, and when possible, translated texts are offered in assisting the cross-linguistic transference between the native 
language and English. In an effort to draw upon the native language, bilingual glossaries based on content reading and 
vocabulary is created and implemented throughout the year.  Instructional design and delivery take students' native language 
into account, as it is an invaluable resource.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services are provided as per amended CR Part 154.  ENL students have access to all supports and resources 
corresponding to age and grade levels drawing heavily from informational texts aligned to meeting the Common Core 
Standards. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
J.H.S. 190 does not share a building. However, technology is one tool used to provide curricular and instructional support to 
meet the diverse needs of all ELLs, including ELL-SWDs.  Technology is integrated throughout interdisciplinary project based 
learning and instruction.  Students will utilize tools such as Web 2.0 to create educational web pages in a secured environment 
to allow students to showcase their published work and build their sense of achievement.  In implementing additional 
technology, programs such as PhotoStory and MovieMaker, will afford students ample opportunities to maintain and further 
develop their listening and speaking skills in creating a multimedia end product such as slide shows, video clips and short 
movies.  In creating these multimedia projects, students will further develop their reading and writing skills by researching, 
editing and writing dialogues, interviewing, and narratives. The National Geographic Program will also provide web-based 
assessments and scaffolded materials in both English and their native language.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We have a Title III after school program held twice a week providing enrichment to all ELL students. All newly enrolled ELLs are 
invited to attend the program. There is a Beacon program housed at Sage that students have access to as well as all after 
school activities such as math club, debate team and computer club. These activities are shared with our newly enrolled 
students via translated fliers as well as IO Pupilpath Skedula. New students entering the building also meet with the school 
counselor to assist in the transitioning to a new environment. The parent coordinator helps in assuring information for 
students and parents is disseminated and accessible in home languages through IO Pupilpath Skedula. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Students who have tested Transitioning, Expanding and Commanding on the NYSESLAT are offered Latin, Spanish or French 
depending on class placement. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All school personnel will attend Professional Learning offerings from District as well as City-wide Professional Learning.  Key 
personnel will turnkey information. The entire Russell Sage community will have access to and will take advantage of the 
professional Learning workshops offered on Mondays as well as lunch and learns that will take place throughout the school 
year.  
All Russell Sage personnel will take advantage of professional learning on the use of data and promoting academic language 
across content areas to prepare ELLs for New York State assessments throughout the academic year.  Professional learning will 
take place in November and in June. Topics include training but are not limited to access to SMART Boards and IO Pupil 
Skedula, implementation of technology to develop all four modalities of language, specifically listening and 
speaking.  Professional Learning in navigating SESIS will be provided to assist pedagogues in the assessment and tracking of 
student progress.  Hour long professional learning will be provided on the first Monday professional learning during the school 
year. Topics include interdisciplinary planning and implementation of the Common Core Standards to further develop 
academic vocabulary in the content area.  Additional professional learning opportunities will take place during Lunch-and-
Learn sessions on a needs-basis.  Teachers of ELLs will continue to teach and learn instructional strategies from professional 
learnings provided by qualified specialists from the City of New York. All ELL personnel will be offered professional learning in 
how to use and interpret data from various state assessments such as MOSL Assessments, New York State Math, New York 
State ELA and the NYSESLAT.  The know-how of navigating exam history, assessment reports and analysis will be the driving 
force behind instructional strategies and decisions for ELLs.  The training will include practical application of data to assist ELLs’ 
equal participation in Literacy, Mathematics, Science and other core subject initiatives.  The professional learning focus on data 
will enable the school to identify and address ELLs who are lacking the fundamental language and number sense skills to 
succeed in both reading and mathematics.  Likewise, these basic skills predict and influence ELLs’ success in other core 
subjects such as Social Studies and Science.  ELL personnel will be guided through the unique challenges ELLs encounter when 
acquiring academic vocabulary in the content area.  Teachers will gain insights, practical scaffolds, and research-based 
strategies that may be implemented in the classroom to foster acquisition of academic English that can be used across the 
content domains. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Many school events such as school dances, fund raising, field days, bake sales, and other various school trips take place 
occasionally to create and promote school community where the students feel welcome and safe. All ELL students are 
encouraged to participate in all the offerings. Also, professional learning will be offered by the Guidance department and well 
as ENL teachers to share ideas and to expand the effort to the community. 
All Russell Sage personnel will continue to take advantage of Monday Professional Learnings as well as Lunch-and Learns 
offered throughout the school year.  Any Professional Learning opportunities provided by the Office of ELLs will be shared with 
the entire staff by e-mail.  The content teachers along with the entire staff will be encouraged to attend a minimum of two 
professional learning sessions with focus on ELL related topics.  As per Bi-lingual/ENL teachers, the priority will be placed on 
ELL related professional learnings including EDAT (formally AMAO), NYSESLAT, NYSITELL and MOSL  trainings. Agendas will be 
provided for all meetings and attendance will be taken to ensure the participation of staff members. Agendas and attendance 
are being kept in the main office.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The needs of ELL parents are surveyed during the orientation meeting at the beginning of the academic year and periodically 
throughout the year.  An invitation (in the various home languages) is extended to all ELL parents to take a decision making 
role in the education of their child from selecting a language program model to students’ participation in after school 
programs.  Meetings are planned specifically for the need of ELL parents addressing common questions and concerns 
regarding service entitlement, understanding state assessments data and requirements and available resources.  Translators 
are provided on-site and on the phone to encourage and facilitate parent participation in the school 
community.  Informational flyers regarding school functions such as curriculum night and parent teacher conferences are sent 
out in multiple languages. Additionally, translators are present in the school during student-led conferences.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Our Parent Coordinator, Mrs. Shoko Obata, as well as our PTA send out calendars in parent's preferred languages and fliers via 
IO Classroom Skedula, our on-line communication site, informing parents of events and activities throughout the school year. 
These communications are translated in the student's home language. The Parent Coordinator is also available to provide 
information regarding available services in and outside the school, such as adult ESL courses as per parents’ requests.  Lastly, 
parents receive emails of school related information.  All efforts hope to communicate that school personnel are available to 
address  parents’ needs and to create a safe and engaging environment for the participation of all parents, specifically ELL 
parents. There will be three, two-hour ELL Parent Meetings per year addressing the following topics and taking place in the 
following months;  November - Overview of the Academic  School Year, March - NYS English and Mathematics Test and 
NYSESLAT and May - Promotion and Graduation Criteria.  For all school events, interpretation services are available.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, John Greggo, Principal, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) and the Home Language Report (RHLA) are generated to assess the 
school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs. The primary language spoken by the parent is 
determined and recorded in ATS upon student enrollment. If this language is not English, the Home Language 
Identification Survey is administered in the parents’ native language and recorded in ATS. The school’s written 
translation and oral interpretations needs are maintained and updated with information provided by parents on 
Student Emergency Blue cards. These procedures provide Limited English Speaking parents equal access to 
programs and services, allowing all parents to participate meaningfully in their child’s education. Parents also 
have an opportunity to see the video in various languages regarding services. In addition, information is send 
home via our Pupil Path system. This system automatically translates the letter/information into their native 
language.
