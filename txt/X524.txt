Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

Crotona International High School’s mission is to provide a high quality learning environment that prepares recently 
arrived adolescent immigrants to be resourceful self-advocates and active contributing members of their 
communities. Crotona International students will graduate equipped to think critically about the world around them 
and to effectively communicate their ideas as they work with others to address problems, make decisions, and affect 
positive change. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Crotona International High School (CIHS) is unique because it serves a population of entirely newcomer immigrant 
adolescents who are classified as English Language Learners, about a quarter of whom are classified as SIFE (Students 
With Interrupted Formal Education), which means they may have attended little or no school and are not literate in 
any language. Like all members of the Internationals Network for Public Schools (INPS), CIHS instruction is based on a 
unique pedagogical model. The focus of this model is on (1) teaching English language literacy through the content 
areas, as well as using (2) heterogeneous ability grouping, (3) collaborative learning strategies & structures, and (4) 
project-based learning to achieve the goal of developing students’ English language ability while developing their 
critical thinking skills and content area knowledge in all content areas, in line with the Common Core. The fact that 
our students speak over 15 different languages and come from over 25 different countries is a strength of our 
community, but also poses special challenges for communicating with parents. As a part of INPS, we are also part of a 
group of schools who are permitted by NYS to graduate our students based on Performance Based Assessment in all 
content areas, as an alternative to basing graduation requirements solely on Regents exam scores.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our student population is comprised of students who are new to the country and hence ELLs. The students are at 
varying levels of English language development. Freshman and sophomores are generally at beginning or emerging 
levels of NYSESLAT. This requires all our teachers to integrate language and content in their instruction. This is also 
one of our school principles and teachers receive constant professional development and PDs to support their 
instructional growth. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year we made most progress in Tenet 3 - Curriculum development and teacher support. Half of our staff 
was new to the school and included many new teachers, not just new to school but also to teaching profession. We 
made systematic structures and systems of support which included mentoring, coaching, individualized and group 
professional development and consistent evaluative and non evaluative feedback in formal and informal ways. 

We also made significant progress in Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health. With addition of a 
counselor for each team of around 75 students we were able to provide more targeted support to students and team 
teachers. This resulted in 1.7 point improvement in our attendance and we were able to achieve our CEP goal. Our 
suspension rate also decreased significantly from 34% in 2016-17 to 9% in 2017-18. 

Tenet 6 - Family and Community Engagement is another area where we made significant improvements. We 
improved parent attendance during all the parent teacher conferences and monthly workshops.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the feedback from the NYSED review (2017-18) our school should work on content and language objectives 
linked to measurable outcomes in daily lessons. The feedback also included clarifying expectations around curriculum 
planning in a staff handout. On School Quality Report for 'How effective is the teaching and learning? (1.2), our school 
received a Developing. 

Based on this feedback we have to continue to work on improving the planning and pedagogical practices at our school 
we have identified daily lesson planning as our focus for this year. This year we are focusing on the lesson plans with 
specific content and language objectives aligned to formative assessments that measure students growth on the 
objectives. The objectives will be aligned to the school wide skill outcomes that have been identified by the school staff 
as the key skills needed for students to be successful. These skills are aligned to the graduation portfolio rubrics and 
Common Core Standards. Our school has structures within the schedule where the teachers can engage in deeper 
discussions around objectives and lesson planning and teacher leaders can be guided and trained to do this work 
through our distributed leadership structures. Our distributed leadership structure and system allows for flow of 
communication between the teachers, teacher leaders and school leaders. Our goal is to maximize our systems and 
structures to hone in on the work around lesson planning.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

NYSED review outlined that students should be more aware about their progress on the outcomes. We have used an 
online grading system to update grades, attendance and anecdotal information regarding students behavior and 
academic activities. In addition, school teachers have identified 10 school wide skills to create outcomes and indicators. 
These outcomes and indicators are used to provide criteria and feedback to the students. The student awareness 
around the outcomes and indicators varies based on teachers making the connections between activities, assessments 
and outcomes explicit in their instruction. To address the feedback, this year we are focusing on student awareness 
around their performance on these outcomes. At Crotona we have a counselor for each team of around 75-80 students 
and our 2018-19 schedule has 2 or 3 weekly advisory sessions for the students. As a part of the plan guidance team and 
advisors will meet regularly with the students and advisors (teachers) of each team to create goals and log in to the 
online grading systems to check on their grades, with them. Team teachers who are also the advisors, will work closely 
with the guidance team members in ensuring that students receive ample opportunities to improve and take ownership 
of their performance in school.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 4: Teacher Practices 
and Decisions)

Tenet 4 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized 

around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs. 

4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards 

(CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students. 

4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning 

environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths 
and needs of all students.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the feedback of NYSED Visit , our school should work on alignment of daily lesson plans to content and 
language objectives. The feedback included the rationale that teachers want and need more support and feedback on 
their lesson plans. This feedback and needs assessment guided us to work on the objectives with alignment to the 
activities and assessment. 

Our Learning Environment Survey for 2018-19 has 70% of teachers saying that their professional development 
experiences this year have been sustained and coherent. (Q10a). This shows that we have to do more work on keeping 
coherent and consistent on the main focus of our PD's. As this year's instructional focus is on alignment of daily 
objectives and activities, our PD's, observation feedback, peer feedback and instructional meeting time will be focused. 
Our Learning Environment Survey for 2018-19 says that 96% of our teachers talk with one another about instruction. 
(Q8d). As a school we value peer feedback and have structures where interdisciplinary teams and departments can 
support each other by providing feedback to each other on the daily lesson plans. Thus sharing their expertise and best 
practices. As we are also working actively towards improving pedagogy as a school, this work around daily plans with 
clear and concise objective will help teachers think about all aspects of day to day instruction. The plan with weekly 
feedback cycles in team and department meetings is that teachers will focus on implementation of the the knowledge 
gained from weekly professional development sessions.

NYSED visit, school leaders should give feedback to the teachers within two days of observation. In addition we received 
a 'developing' on component 1.2 Pedagogy on our Quality Review. On the Learning Environment Survey 89% teachers 
say that the principal makes clear to the staff his or her expectations for meeting instructional goals. (Q11a).  

As a school with large percentage of new teachers who need to be trained in the Internationals approach on planning 
and pedagogy, we want to focus on ensuring that our expectations are clear, conduct regular walk-throughs and 
feedback cycles to give constructive feedback. Our strengths include our structures like weekly Professional 
Development sessions and a team of school leaders who meet and norm their practices through conversations and 
doing walkthroughs together. Our experienced teaching staff and new teachers work in inter-disciplinary and 
disciplinary teams . This structure facilitates regular peer feedback cycles on lesson plans and sharing of best practices.

Based on the NYSED feedback 2017-2018, school leaders will plan to provide training for students and parents to 
enable them to understand student achievement and progress data in their native languages. Beginning 2018-2019 
school year will host workshops to educate students and their families on our Jumprope system and standard based 
learning models. We will continue to focus future workshops on parent needs and topics that they are interested in. 
We plan to conduct a survey and find areas of interest for them and then conduct workshops by inviting speakers 
from outside where relevant.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

Crotona International High School recruits highly qualified teaching candidates through both the NYCDOE Open 
Market system and via the Internationals Network of Public Schools, a non-profit organization that oversees and 
coordinates activities amongst the NYCDOE’s 15 International High Schools. Through our membership in this network, 
we have access to resumes of the school system’s most highly qualified pedagogues with vast experience working 
with ELLs, which is the demographic of 100% of all of the International High Schools’ student populations. We also 
recruit teachers from the new teacher finder, teaching fellows, Math for America and Math Immersion Program. We 
follow a multi-step process in hiring of the teachers, it includes an interview, a demo lesson and a reference check. 

 

Through our team facilitators, discipline facilitators, PD committee, and Portfolio committee, teachers have great 
decision-making power in establishing, maintaining and altering school-wide policies. Further, professional growth of 
all pedagogues is fostered on two levels: bi-weekly content-area discipline meetings and weekly interdisciplinary 
grade level team meetings. During common prep periods, all teachers of the same subject area discipline meet twice a 
week in order to co-plan and to follow school-wide protocols in order to analyze and provide feedback on each 
other’s curriculum, with a critical eye towards meeting the tenets of the Internationals Approach, as well as the 
school-wide goals as informed by the Danielson framework. Teachers also meet in their interdisciplinary teams twice 
a week in order to discuss student academic & social-emotional progress, and examine the work of their mutually 
shared students. In this way, all of a student’s teachers come together to discuss his or her progress, as well as look 
for broader patterns in student learning that can be altered to improve student achievement. Because each 
interdisciplinary team includes one ESL-certified teacher and/or Special education teacher, each team member, 
regardless of subject area certification, learns about ESL & special education strategies to further enhance instruction

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Crotona international High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Crotona International HS will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

· providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

· providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

· fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

· providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

· sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

· providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  

 

· actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

· engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated directly 
to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

· ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

· support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

· maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

· conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

· provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

· host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

· schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning or 
evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

· translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; 

· conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

· holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

· hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

· encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
  At CIHS, we utilize a content-based ESL program for our recent immigrant students.  Our 21 
teachers and 3 full time and part time discipline coaches will work in the context of 4 
interdisciplinary teams to design and implement standards-based, interdisciplinary, project-based 
curricula for the 338 students they mutually share.  Teachers in all content areas infuse their 
curricula with ESL methodologies and strategies for language development.  Most course work 
in the classroom is completed in cooperative learning groups; groups are alternately and 
purposefully homogeneous or heterogeneous (by ability, gender, and first language, where 
possible), so as to optimize opportunities for language development.   
  
As effective as these school-wide strategies are, the unique student population at CIHS -- new to 
the country and beginning to learn  English -- means that many students need supplemental 
support in order to pass their courses and Regents exams in a timely manner. 
 
We will serve our 100% ELL student population and specifically students identified as SIFE. 
Our students are spread across two teams of 9/10th grades mixed and have the highest 
concentration of SIFE students.  We also have one team of 11th grade and another of 12th grade. 
  
AFTER SCHOOL TITLE III INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM 
2 ESL Certified teacher will offer after school enrichment for English for students who are 
struggling in their classes. These students were chosen among all ELLs at CIHS because of one 
or more factors:  SIFE status; low literacy in their native language and/or in English; persistently 
low achievement in the content class.  Program start date:  09/17/2018.  Program end date:  6/14 
/2019.  Program times:  2:45-4:45pm for each section.  Number of sections & days of 
the  week:   1 section on Wednesdays and Thursdays. Materials used:  bilingual dictionaries, 
English dictionaries, NEWSELA program, Reading Plus program, and materials adapted from 
QTEL & INPS .  
  
 
4 ESL certified teachers will teach with 4 math certified teachers. Title III supplemental services 
for CC Algebra will serve 100 ELLs in grades 9-11 and for Algebra II, will serve 25 ELLs in 
grades 11-12.  These students were chosen among all ELLs at CIHS because of one or more 
factors:  SIFE status; low literacy in their native language and/or in English, persistent low 
achievement in the content class.   Additionally, supplemental services are provided to a small 
number of stronger students in 10th grade to accelerate their progress towards success on the 
Regents exam. Program start date:  9/17/2018.  Program end date:  6/14/2019.  Program

Throughout the CIHS program, including the after-school supplemental services, English is the 
language of instruction;  however, purposeful heterogeneous grouping as well as collaborative 
instructional strategies support students in maintaining their native language, which is essential 
to their ability to develop their academic, intellectual, and social abilities. 
  
Rationale for the selection of program/activities 
  
Title III after-school programs were chosen because we wanted to ensure that students who were 
experiencing academic difficulties were provided with intensive individual and small group 
support in order that they have the highest chance in acquiring course credit and passing 
exams.  In addition, we want to provide opportunities for acceleration for a smaller number of 
students with more advanced skills in mathematics and English literacy while subsequently

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
      The majority of our students are ELLs (and newly enrolled students are ELLs).  Parental 
involvement at CIHS is difficult for several reasons:  Many families fall below the federal 
poverty level, so parents often work two or more jobs; parents themselves experience difficulty 
making cultural transitions to a U. S. school system and are unaccustomed to being involved in 
their child's school; as our entire ELL population is 14-20 years old, a great number of them live 
with siblings or other more distant relatives or friends who do not acknowledge a responsibility 
to support our students academically, and many of our students live 
independently.  Nevertheless, parent involvement at CIHS has been steadily increasing.   At PTA 
meetings last year, and average of 50% of our ELL students had family representation, an 
increase from an average of 25% PTA involvement in the previous year.  At the first meeting or 
new parents in September 2017, nearly 100% of new students had family representation. 
  
Workshop topics for parents will include:   Graduation Requirements & the Portfolio Process -- 
supporting your ELL child on the path to graduation (DATE: 9/26/18 TIME: 5:00pm-8:00pm, 
provided by college advisor Naomy Taveras, and ESL certified teachers), Families of ELLs -
-  How your academic work in H.S. affects your postsecondary options tentative (DATE: 
10/27/18, TIME 9am-12pm, provided by College advisor Naomy Taveras & ESL-certified 
teacher), and Common Core Curriculum--Strategies Supporting your ELL child's Success 
(DATE: 2/9/2019, TIME: 9am-12pm, provided by College Advisor Naomy Taveras& ESL-
certified teacher.  Our Parent Coordinator, Maria Dominguez, meets with nearly all parents of 
graduating seniors, both individually and at college orientation meetings.    A few parents are 
regularly involved in volunteering at CIHS, supporting the Parent Coordinator and other staff, 
and several parents provide translation and interpretation services during PTA meetings and 
parent workshops. 
  
Parents of  CIHS students meet on the third Thursday of each month, September through June, 
5:30 - 7:30.  Workshops are led by Naomy Taveras, College Advisor and Maria Dominguez, 
parent coordinator, Shanneell Downer, Guidance Counselor and Chevannee Scott, Guidance 
Counselor long with one certified teacher from each grade level.            
 
Parents will be notified via letters and phone calls. A binder will be maintained for all the 
agendas, attendance sheets and materials used in the meetings.

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
For newcomers we use Multilingual Literacy SIFE screener to assess our students' literacy skills. We also use teacher-created 
assessments to provide us with each student's grade level in reading comprehension, writing, speaking and listening skills.  The 
results offer a breakdown of specific areas of strengths and weaknesses, so we can gear our instruction toward helping the 
student in areas of academic need and tailor extra help specifically geared to those students.  The teacher made assessments 
allow us to assess student's decoding skills, vocabulary and comprehension.  The results of these assessments are shared with

our content area teachers.  This information helps inform our school's instructional plan, allowing us to design curriculum to 
address the specific needs of students.  This data is used to inform our curriculum, instructional approaches and 
interventions.  Our teachers work to develop reading and writing skills through all content areas.  Through this consistent 
reinforcement of reading and writing in their classes as well as in our afterschool and Saturday programming, students see 
improvement, in their scores over time. We are also using formative assessment tasks based on the Internationals Network 
Graduation portfolio rubrics.  This data, along with that culled from our intake interview process, show that our students enter 
our program with a wide variety of prior schooling, academic skills, and literacy skills (in both English and their native 
languages).  This data provide teachers with the information they need to properly differentiate their content area, project-
based curricula, which is delivered to a student population that is heterogeneous on many fronts. Furthermore, by using a 
standards based mastery grading system, it allows teachers to track students' growth in specific learning targets in all 
modalities and make informed decisions to help adjust instruction around language acquisition.   
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ELL team routinely review this information then turnkeys this information to their respective grades so that all teachers 
are involved and familiar with each student they teach.  Suggestions and modifications are made based on the information of 
useful strategies and supports specific students may need. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our program is measured through the analysis of a wide array of data sources, including: 
•     Graduation rate 
•     Course pass rate 
•     Regents pass rate 
•     Attendance rate 
•     Learning Environment Survey-student results 
•     Learning Environment Survey -parent results 
•     Learning Environment Survey-teacher results 
•     College Now class passing rate 
•     Portfolio passing rate 
Internal quarterly scholarship reports   
  
Crotona International High School is part of the Internationals Network for Public Schools which is a network of schools who 
have been granted a variance which allows for portfolio-based assessment in lieu of the New York State Regents Exams.  We 
only administer the ELA Regents exam and Integrated Algebra Regents exam, which is why these are the only Regents we have 
included. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We offer additional literacy periods to address areas of need and organize those classes homogeneously based on students' 
needs.  There are also specific classes for SIFE students offered throughout the school day. Interventions include push in and 
pull out services, after school programming, and before school tutoring services.  in addition, at weekly staff meetings, 
teachers review this data to inform their instructional practices and differentiate their instruction to fit students' needs.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
In weekly department and grade team meetings, teachers review data to discuss common trends and create strategies to 
support students' needs.  They discuss tools they will use to differentiate their instruction and help students address any 
needs.  Teachers reference the policy guide to provide scaffolds in vocabulary development, emphasize reading and writing

techniques, and emphasize visuals in their instruction.  Subsequently, the teacher teams conduct routine reviews to assess 
whether the interventions are working.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The following is based on results before the 2016 NYSESLAT results are available.  
  
The NYSESLAT data indicates that the majority of our incoming class are beginners. However, over the course of their 4 years 
most of our students improve in their literary skills.  
An analysis of our NYSITELL and NYSESLAT shows 
a)  Our population is incredibly heterogeneous in terms of language ability. 
b)  Most students classified as beginners and intermediates are situated in the lower grades (9 and 10) however many students 
have not reached proficiency by 11th and 12th grades 
c)  The vast majority of students show improvement in at least two of the NYSESLAT language modalities. 
d) Our NYSITELL data indicates that although most of our new arrivals test as Beginners and nearly all score very low in 
listening, reading, and writing, after this, the most crucial pattern we see is one of improvement by 12th grade,. 
    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ELL team reviews this data to notice shifts and changes over the year.  In addition, it is compared to course passing data to 
identify discrepancies in skills.  This team meets once a month to determine next steps and turnkeys information to their 
respective grades.  Literacy groups are then organized based on proficiency levels and shifted over the course of the semesters 
as students' improve.  The EDAT is also used to collate information and review data.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

.  Instruction: 
            Instruction at our school is delivered collaboratively by teams of four to six teachers who work to plan 
instruction for groups of approximately 75-100 students.  While teachers are responsible for teaching their own 
individual classes, they plan curriculum jointly and occasionally team teach classes as well. Each group of students is 
block programmed and those students travel together throughout the day.  Within their blocks 9th and 10th grade 
students are on three distinct interdisciplinary instructional teams while 11th and 12th grade students are on distinct 
instructional teams.  The blocks are heterogeneous but at various times teachers may choose to group students 
within the block homogeneously if that suits the students’ and block’s needs for a specific project or learning 
activity.  Teachers also use these blocks to take advantage of learning opportunities outside the building at such 
places as museums, cultural organizations, and other community organizations 
  
            Integrated and Standalone ENL are implemented in the following way:  Beginning/Entering students will 
receive a minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of 
integrated ENL/ELA and 180 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL (with ELA or any other content area).  Low 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61 

 

 

Intermediates/Emerging will receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 
minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content 
area.  Intermediate/Transitionsing will receive 180 ENL minutes per week which consists of 90 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). 
Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of ENL per week which consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
or other content area.  Proficient/Commanding or students who are former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each 
week which consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           As per the new CR Part 154 requirements, beginning September 2015, students will be carefully programmed to receive 
the mandated ENL and ELA instructional minutes based on new proficiency guidelines.  Beginners/Entering students will 
receive a minimum of 540 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of ENL standalone, 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA and 180 minutes of standalone or intergrated ENL with ELA or any other content area).  Low Intermediates/Emerging 
will receive 360 minutes of ENL per week (this consists of 90 minutes of standalone ENL, 180 minutes of integrated 
ENL/ELA  and 90 minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area.)  Intermediate/Transitioning 
willl receive 180 ENL minutes per week (this consists of 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area and 90 
minutes of standalone or integrated ENL with ELA or any other content area). Advanced/Expanding will receive 180 minutes of 
ENL per week (this consists of 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  Proficient/Commanding or students 
who are former ELL's will receive 90 minutes of ENL each week (this consists of 90 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area.)  
     We have a series of delivery models to ensure that each student receives these mandated ENL and ELA minutes through 
discrete ENL classes as well as many classes taught by dual certified ESL/content area teachers. (ie: teachers who have dual 
certification in both ESL and a content area such as ESL/English and ESL/Social Studies certification.). All of our content area 
teachers are trained in language development and ESL methodologies and some are pursuing ESL certification.  The school 
schedule and teacher programming ensure that all entitled ENL students receive the mandated number of minutes required 
according to CR Part 154.  In addition to our regular content curriculum all ELL students are given extra ENL instruction in order 
to meet the number of minutes they require of ENL instruction each week. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
        At Crotona International High School our ESL teachers as well as all of our content area teachers provide content area 
support for ELL's through all content area classes. All students take math, science, social studies, and ESL and/or English every 
year.  Although the language that teachers use from the front of the room is English, the language of instruction for specific 
projects and on any specific day is collaboratively determined – students use both English and their native languages to 
explore content and the locus of control for language is student-driven by the content and the students’ needs.  Instruction is 
not unidirectional from teacher to student in our school.  Students work in groups to complete collaborative tasks that both 
develop language and content knowledge. 
  
        The instructional method used in delivering content area instruction is through the Internationals Network for Public 
Schools (INPS) Approach.  This research-based instructional approach utilizes five strategies which foster language 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           62 

 

deveopment and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  They consist of heterogeneity and 
collaboration, experiential and project based learning, language and content integration, localized autonomy and responsibility 
and one learning model for all.  A variety of instructional materials are used such as: laptops, library books, work books, 
dictionaries and teacher-generated activities.  The educational principles of The Internationals High Schools we include an 
approach to curriculum that is student-centered, inquiry- driven, and project-based, revolving around themes and essential 
questions that provide a balance between content and English language skill building.  Small, heterogeneous grouping within 
classes provides a powerful vehicle for English acquisition, wherein students from diverse language backgrounds use English to 
accomplish a given task, drawing on their native language as a resource.  Language and literacy are developed through 
interaction with peers and teachers about meaningful ideas in authentic context.  In order to provide our students with native 
language support in the content area we provide our students with bilingual dictionaries, peer group support, native language 
texts and projects to assist in the classroom. 
  
        All students take math, science, social studies, arts, and ESL and/or English every year.  The Internationals approach is 
similar to a sheltered instruction model in that content area teachers have an understanding, training and background in 
teaching ELLs.   Because students are on a team with an interdisciplinary team of teachers, the team works together to 
develop curriculum and materials for their ELL students.  The ESL teacher on the team provides support in the scaffolding of 
the work and in incorporating the content of other classes into their language class as a means of additional support.  Although 
the language that teachers use from the front of the room is English, the language of instruction for specific Common-Core 
aligned projects and on any specific day is collaboratively determined – students use both English and their native languages to 
explore content and the locus of control for language is student-driven by the content and the students’ needs.  A variety of 
English and native language texts are used in the classrooms and many projects incorporate a native language component. 
Instruction is not unidirectional from teacher to student in our school.  Students work in groups to complete collaborative 
tasks that develop both language and content knowledge simultaneously.  The school makes a significant investment in 
professional development to make sure all of our teachers in every subject area have the necessary skills and conceptual 
understanding of language development to deliver the needed instruction that meets students’ needs. This professional 
development is ongoing and sustained from year to year and has focused on the past few years on aligning all of our 
curriculum to the Common Core. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELL’s are appropriately evaluated using the instructional strategies as described in Question # 6 (a-e) below.  At orientation, 
incoming ELL’s are given a native language assessment. For more common languages, students on intake are administered 
paperwork in native language and are interviewed.  Spanish speaking students are administered the Spanish Lab and our 
native language staff can give feedback on projects and assessments. For languages where we don't have formal assessments 
in place, we rely on community partners, peers and families for feedback throughout the year. At Crotona International HS, we 
greatly value students' native languages.  All of our interdisciplinary classes have native language components to them.  We 
have a comprehensive native language performance-based assessment which all of our ELL students must complete. 
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a)     Instructional plan for SIFE Students: 
        We have found that many students that are labeled SIFE in ATS seem to be mislabeled, since some of these have been 
some of our highest achieving students.  Therefore, through our internal interview and assessment process, we make sure to 
identify any SIFE student that will need additional support.  In all content area classes, all SIFE students are heterogeneously 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

mixed with their ELL peers.  Instruction in all classes is project-based and incorporates multiple strategies for the acquisition of 
both language and content, including: layered curriculum, leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, collaborative group work, 
oral presentations, project-based assessments, scaffolding, differentiation, and QTEL strategies.   During a twice weekly 
targeted intervention period, our SIFE students work with a certified ESL teacher on their team for additional support. 
Saturday School and after-school tutoring provide additional support for these students. 
  
b)     Instructional Plan for Newcomer ELL Students: 
         
Newcomer ELLs are placed in heterogeneous ESL and content area classes with ELL peers of varying academic, linguistic, and 
ethnic backgrounds.  Instruction in all classes is project-based and incorporates multiple strategies for the acquisition of both 
language and content, including: layered curriculum, leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, collaborative group work, oral 
presentations, project-based assessments, scaffolding, differentiation, and QTEL strategies.   Newcomers may also participate 
in our Explorer's Club,  a series of excursions to cultural institutions throughout NYC with companion literacy activities focusing 
on developing verbal and written skills.  
  
  
c. ELLs receiving services for 4 to 6 years are placed in heterogeneous ESL and content area classes with ELL peers of varying 
academic, linguistic, and ethnic backgrounds.  Instruction in all classes is project-based and incorporates multiple strategies for 
the acquisition of both language and content, including: layered curriculum, leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, 
collaborative group work, oral presentations, project-based assessments, scaffolding, differentiation, and QTEL strategies.  
  
d. Long-Term ELLs are placed in heterogeneous ESL and content area classes with ELL peers of varying academic, linguistic, and 
ethnic backgrounds.  Instruction in all classes is project-based and incorporates multiple strategies for the acquisition of both 
language and content, including: layered curriculum, leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, collaborative group work, oral 
presentations, project-based assessments, scaffolding, differentiation, and QTEL strategies.   Long-term ELLs receive support in 
our Senior Institute Seminars, a class that meets three times per week and is geared towards helping these students make up 
missing credits or preparing for the specific Regents examinations they have not yet passed.   
  
e. While our students who reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT are no longer considered ELLs, they are still in need of language 
development.  Our instructional model, the “Internationals Approach,” insures that these students continue to develop their 
academic language alongside their ELL peers in our heterogeneously mixed classes.  Teachers differentiate their project-based 
curriculum so that all of our students, ELLs and former ELLs alike, are being challenged in reading, writing, speaking and 
listening at their level of proficiency.  Former ELLs also receive the appropriate testing accomodations including extended time, 
use of bilingual dictionaries and translated versions of the test in their native language when available. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The guidance counselor, Assistant Principal and Special Education teacher review all IEP’s for ELL-SWD’s to ensure that all IEP 
mandates are being met and to ensure that the ELL-SWD student receives the appropriate program in the least restrictive 
environment.  After reviewing the mandates of the IEP, the full team of teachers meet with the Special Education teacher to 
discuss specific instructional strategies that would prove valuable to the growth of the ELL-SWD student and follow the 
mandates of the IEP.  The team along with the guidance counselor, Assistant Principal and Special Education teacher ensure 
that all of the mandates in the IEP are carried out. If additional support is needed the student is provided with additional 
support services as per the IEP.   
The ELL-SWD students who may have learning needs undiagnosed in their home country, have been here a short time and are 
only beginning to learn English, and/or have experienced serious disruptions and inadequacies in their earlier academic 
preparation are addressed by creating instructional opportunities geared to their needs. Students with Individualized 
Education Plans (IEP's) receive full support from the instructional teams to which they belong. Those students are included in 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64 

 

mainstream classes, and receive additional services in language, counseling, and adaptive physical education. In biweekly 
meetings, the teachers of our instructional teams meet to review the progress of these and other students. Teams of teachers 
along with the guidance counselors meet regularly throughout the semester to review the progress of each student in 
accordance with their specific IEP. 
Some of the specific instructional strategies for ELLs depending on the requirements of their specific IEP’s include: Teachers, 
guidance counselors and special education teacher meet regularly to discuss the individual needs of the ELL-SWD 
student.  Once students have been identified as ELL-SWD and a program has been established following the mandates of their 
IEP, the challenge is to find ways to teach the student the skills they require while also teaching the student to read, write and 
speak English and acquire content knowledge when they may have limited, if any academic skills, have specific disabilities as 
descreibed in their IEP and may have serious affective issues as well.  In order to service the ELL-SWD student in the least 
restrictive environment, students are mainstreamed into the regular academic class and each team provides extra services: 
including one-on-one work with a paraprofessional, small group instruction and after school tutoring.  School-wide, a Saturday 
enrichment program has been established, and changes in student programs are made to allow the student time to meet with 
the necessary special service provider depending on the students specific needs.   
Other strategies include scaffolding students’ work in the regular heterogeneous classes for most of the school day by 
developing collaboration between the special education teacher or service provider and the content area teachers.  A team 
teaching approach would be used in which the special education teacher plans with the content area teachers to map out 
strategies an best practices and to access the students strengths and area which still need improvement. 
If necessary, ELL-SWD students are expected to attend extra after school home work sessions and are also enrolled in our 
weekly Saturday Explorers Literacy Program which serves to enhance their literacy skills through exploration of NYC and its 
environment.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
      
We have a very small number of students with IEPs.  A special education teacher both pushes in to classes and pulls students 
out during school-wide intervention periods. ELLs identified as special needs are accomodated per the mandates of their IEPs, 
which in most cases involves a SETTS model.  These students are placed in heterogeneous ESL and content area classes with 
ELL peers of varying academic, linguistic, and ethnic backgrounds.  Our special education teacher pushes in to these classes 
and works individually and in small groups with these students for Math and Social Studies classes and do pull out SETTS 
classes 5x a week.    In addition, the special education teacher works with teachers to further scaffold the curriculum to meet 
these students individual needs and goals.  Instruction in all classes is project-based and incorporates multiple strategies for 
the acquisition of both language and content, including: layered curriculum, leveled reading materials, jigsaw readings, 
collaborative group work, oral presentations, project-based assessments, scaffolding, differentiation, and QTEL strategies.   
   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 All of our targeted intervention programs are geared towards supporting all of our ELL subgroups; teachers running these 
programs implement the “Internationals Approach” in all of them:  
•     Language & Enrichment program:   %x a week junior institute ELLs are programmed for a period in which they are provided 
extra time to work on their projects with language outcomes in small groups. 
•       Social emotional support Advisory -  1x week students sit in cirlces and talk about socio emotional issues while practicing 
all language modalities. 
•     Regents Prep classes – 11th and 12th grade ELLs who have not yet passed the Integrated Algebra or ELA Regents 
Examinations are offered Regents preparation classes taught in English.    
                 Credit intervention classes:  offered 3x per week to support students in meeting class outcomes that they have not 
yet mastered and/or completion of course extensions.

•    ELL students have opportunities to do community service, research projects, and leadership training.  This will culminate in 
their understanding of social issues that pertain to immigrant populations and thus enhance cultural awareness, social learning 
and a positive adjustment to American society. Every year, all 11th grade ELL students participate in an internship/career 
readiness program. These are all supplemental activities which will aid our students in acquiring English through a variety of 
community involvement activities.  This targeted intervention targets students in all content areas but gives special emphasis 
to the content area of Social Studies.

Before/After School Tutoring-content area teachers in Social Studies, the students native language, English, Math and Science. 
Content area teachers in Social Studies, English, Math and Science provide support to students in all sub-groups in small group 
settings for one to two hours per week.  Although all students may avail themselves of Before/After School tutoring the main 
ELL sub-gropus which are targeted are the SIFE studetns, Newcomers and ELL-SWD students. This not only includes students 
who are having difficulties with their class work but also provides assistance for students who are working on their 10th grade 
and Senior Graduation portfolio projects which include their social studies research paper, native language project, math 
project, science project, English literary essay, creative project as well as their mastery statement.  These classes are taught by 
licensed pedagogues in the content area.  Native language support is provided to students in all of the above mentioned 
intervention programs through the use of paraprofessionals, bilingual pedagogues, student peer and college mentors who 
share a common native language.  In addition, bilingual dictionaries and multi-lingual computer software are utilized as well. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

More targeted support for our SIFE students.  We are sending teachers for professional development.  We are partnering with 
CARA, a college and career access organization to strengthen our college access curriculum.  In addition we are strengthening 
our ELL enrichment program, with enrichment courses in ELA and MATH and targeted credit intervention to support struggling 
students. We are also looking into offering AP courses in students' native languages.  
We are infusing literacy strategies and  creating partnerships for our CTE program.

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All of our ELL students have access to the same materials in English.  Since all teachers design their own project-based 
curricula, there are too many instructional materials to name individually; all teachers draw from multiple sources in compiling 
classroom curricula and materials.  Teachers use textbooks, trade books, the Internet, and periodicals to develop projects and 
support student learning.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

  
All our students participate in our language development/ENL program.  All of our classes use the native language to support 
learning.  As described above, the locus of control over language use resides with our students and they use both English and 
their native languages to discover and develop content.  Some projects every year are done in the native languages and in 
English and students are supported in developing their native languages to the greatest extent possible.  Students are 
supported by peers, community partners, family members and/or school personnel. Our classroom libraries contain content 
materials in all of our major languages. 
  
Native language skills are a valued aspect of all subject area classes.  Students are required to complete a Native language 
project as one component of their graduation portfolio.  This native language project is an informational, communicative or

creative piece in a language other than English, along with a written explanation of the piece in English. 
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Our instructional teams meet regularly to ensure that required services and supports correspond to ELLs' age and grade 
levels.  All of the required services for high school-aged ELLs are available to students. We use a wide array of resources in our 
school including teacher-made materials, text books on a range of levels, trade books at many reading levels, and a large 
variety of non-text hands on materials.  In addition, our school has wireless access in all classrooms and students use the 
Internet to access resources.  If a teacher or instructional team is having problems locating published materials that are 
appropriate to the age of the ELLs then the instructional teams work together to create an adapt material which will be 
appropriate to the age level of the ELL.  Our teachers understand the importance of utilizing materials and resources for the 
ELL’s appropriate age level in order to keep them engaged in learning.  In addition, instructional teams are encouraged to 
attend professional development workshops throughout the year in order to help them better meet the needs of ELLs with age 
and grade level appropriate to the content of the classes.          
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Since all teachers design their own project-based curricula, there are too many instructional materials to name individually; all 
teachers draw from multiple sources in compiling classroom curricula and materials for all subgroups.  Some examples 
include:  
•     QTEL Institute curricula (language) 
•     Internationals Network for Public Schools curricula (provides language and content materials) 
•     History Alive! and Facing History curricula (history)

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Prior to the start of the school year, new students are assigned to heterogeneous teams with, as far as practicable, students 
who speak their native language.  The new students are then paired with more experienced students who are responsible for 
escorting them to class and lunch, making sure they know how to get home, explaining school rules and customs, and acting as

the student, answer questions and ensure that the student is adjusting well. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

French Heritage Language Program (in collaboration with the French Embassy in NYC) – this two-hour weekly program 
supports native language literacy for our francophone (West African and Haitian) ELLs. This class is taught in French.  Advanced 
Spanish is also taught as an after school College Now program with touro College. 
  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1.   Professional development for all staff at The Crotona International High School is geared toward improving ELL academic 
achievement and language development; we build teacher capacity in these areas by a variety of means:  
  
•     Inquiry Projects –  groups of subject area teachers in a common area engage in action inquiry-based research projects 
throughout the year in order to learn more about specific ESL methodologies and strategies that will enhance student 
achievement; all faculty present findings and recommendations to the rest of the staff so that all may benefit from the work of 
the rest.  This year, each content area group of teachers is focusing on different aspects of language development, specifically 
related to writing, and the Common Core Standards.  Each group of discipline teachers is engaged in a Common Core Task, use 
it to diagnose student learning needs, collaboratively plan instructional strategies to meet these needs, and an analysis of the 
success of this instructional implementation. 
  
•     Weekly professional development meetings for all pedagogues, which include the following activities:  
o     Analysis of student work in order to improve instruction/design interventions 
o     Analysis of student assessments (project-based learning)  
o     Social-emotional progress of a teaching team’s shared students  
o     Formation and refinement of discipline specific benchmarks at each grade level  
o     Peer critiques of teacher-generated curricula 
  
•     Peer observations – all pedagogues observe each other teach and write reflective letters pinpointing new strategies and 
techniques they have learned as a result.  The broad focus of these peer observations is on how teachers can most effectively 
support students’ language development in all classes and subjects. 
  
•     All staff participates in Internationals Network for Public Schools Professional Development workshops – at three different 
points in the school year, our entire staff will meet with their peers from our sister International High Schools and attend 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           69 

 

workshops designed specifically for educators of recent immigrant ELL students.  Topics will include scaffolding instruction, 
differentiation of instruction, ESL methodologies, SIFE students, meeting the affective needs of immigrant children, and 
language development.  All-day workshops are provided for APs, pedagogues, ELL coordinators, paraprofessionals, therapists, 
parent coordinators, counselors.   
  
•     International High Schools Intervisitations – in order to promote more intra-network dialogue, and sharing of best 
practices and curriculum, groups of IHS teachers from across the network meet monthly at different IHSs across the city in 
order to learn from their best practices.    
  
•     QTEL/OELL trainings – Our classroom teachers are encouraged to complete workshops with QTEL and other OELL offerings, 
which highlight best practices, like scaffolding and differentiation,  for working with ELLs in the content areas.   
  
•     Conferences – faculty attend a variety of external conferences each year in order to keep abreast of new trends in ESL and 
their content areas. 
  
  
We have had ongoing Common Core training over the past 2 years and will continue to do so as we have been working to align 
all of our projects and curriculum to these standards.  The Internationals Network for Public Schools has offered several PD 
sessions on the Common Core.  Teachers have worked with their departments to learn about the Standards in term of their 
discipline as well as strategies to implement them. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Professional development for all staff at is geared toward improving ELL academic achievement and language development; 
we build teacher capacity in these areas by a variety of means: 
  
Interdisciplinary teams take responsibility for orienting new students to our school and program through our advisory program 
and by pairing them up with a "buddy" who shares the exact same class schedule. Counselors meet with teams each week to 
address concerns on the team and to help them support students as they transition.  Counselors receive training through the 
Internationals Network.  Our Student Support Committee has liaisons to each team and and administrator who meet biweekly 
to discuss student support issues, like transitioning and to create advisory curriculum to support advisors in this process. 
All of our teaching staff, which includes teachers who do not hold ESL or Bilingual licenses, are provided with a series of 
professional opportunities at International High School.  The professional development program focuses on providing teachers 
with various instructional strategies for teaching English Language Learners.  It also focuses on how to prepare ELLs to meet 
and exceed the NYC and NYS performance and learning Standards.  These professional development sessions are facilitated by 
fellow faculty members and school administrators.   
All professional development at our school is focused on building capacity in all teachers to support students' language 
development in all classes by employing ESL methodologies since most of our students (and all of our newly admitted 
students) are ELLs.  The professional development program described above provides multi-year, on-going professional 
development for all members of the faculty.  Even if teachers participated only in the in-school professional development – the 
bare minimum for our teachers – they would be participating in a minimum of forty hours of professional development a 
year.  In addition, our school participates in professional development organized by Internationals Network for Public Schools, 
including intervisitations, summer and election day professional development, and a variety of inter-school project-based 
learning opportunities.  Since all staff participate in the above-mentioned professional development opportunities throughout 
the course of the school year, everyone receives many more hours than the current mandate. Our PD committee develops 
each PD and maintains records in our PD binder.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We will hold annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs at least one time during each school year, in addition to the four 
regular parent teacher conferences.  At these meetings teachers will discuss the goals of the program, the language 
development process of the individual student, the language proficiency assessment results as well as the student's language 
development needs in all content areas. 
At this meeting we will have content area teachers, the student counselor, and a school staff member to translate as 
needed.  If no staff member is able to translate than we will utilize the DOE Translation Unit to hold over the phone 
translations. 
Crotona International High School has teachers working collaboratively on five interdisciplinary teams.  Each of the teams meet 
together to discuss students' language development and content knowledge progress, language proficiency assessment results 
and language development needs during their weekly two hour meeting. 
Each interdisciplinary team has 40 minutes of their weekly team time to utilize for parent involvement time.  This period of 
time which is within the teacher's contractual day is specifically set aside for meetings with parents of ELL's.  Each team is 
assigned a Community Associate in order to place phone calls to parents to schedule meetings. 
  
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  
 Our entire school is for ELLs, all the parents involved are parents of ELLs or former ELLs.  Over 50% of our students’ families 
regularly attend Open School Night and Open School afternoon.  Turnout is lower for monthly Family Association meetings, 
even though we pair such events with student work showcases and CBO workshops We have far more engagement with 
parents and families at the individual student and interdisciplinary team level through our teaching teams as teams meet 
regularly with parents and guardians of our students.  Our PTA officers meet monthly to plan workshops and monthly 
meetings.  They also call families to encourage them to participate.  We currently have 5 parents who are regular participants 
in our SLT.  We also work with a CBO to encourage parent involvement.  They run a Power Parents group made up of 15 of our 
parents who participate and volunteer regularly in our workshops and activities.  For all meetings and activities we always have 
in-house Spanish, French and Arabic translators available.  We use outside services if any other languages are needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ratra Shweta, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Once students are enrolled, the ESL teacher and the Assistant principal analyze Student's Home Language Surveys 
and keep a record of Parent's Preferred Language forms. All staff is made aware of the Parent's Preferred 
language and copies of anything sent home is sent in the parents preferred language. As a school we have always 
considered translation services as a human right. It is with this framework in mind that we work towards ensuring 
that all the language-access needs of our parents are being met. Presently, our student population consists of 86% 
Latino, 6% of African nations, and 4% Arabic speaking students, respectively. From our survey of parents, 40% of 
Latino parents/guardians needed translation services. A list of these findings were reported to staff during pd 
sessions. The ELL coordinator and Assistant Principal review the data from the HLIS and ATS at the beginning of 
the school year as well as when a student is a new admit to ensure proper translations protocol.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

The school will contact the over the phone interpretation services to contact specific parents. There is at least one 
staff member that speaks every language of our students. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Staff will be trained in a staff pd on the available translation services and over the phone interpretation services by 
using the Translation and Interpretation Brochure.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Parents receive the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities sent home by the school and at the entrance of the 
school there is a sign indicating the availability of interpretation services. The committee determines within 30 days if 
translation or interpretation services are required by a parent who speaks the covered eight languages. We do this by 
interviewing the parents and making them aware of their rights to these services. The committee ensure that all 
communication is provided in a timely manner in the primary languages of the parents. Important communication in 
the domains of academic assessments , health, safety, legal matters, special education and ELL services are translated 
to Spanish.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will administer a parent survey which will include questions directly requesting feedback on the quality of the 
translations and available services and whether their needs are being met so that we can restructure our program if 
necessary.
