Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At PS 34 we are committed to the academic success of every child. The school’s mission is to teach a rigorous 
academic curriculum, complimented by a wide range of enrichment opportunities, inclusive of the arts, in a 
supportive and safe environment. Our students are challenged to become lifelong learners who are well prepared for 
the demands of the 21stcentury. We believe the high expectations of today will nurture successful and productive 
citizens of tomorrow. As a community of professional learners we empower our students to grow academically by 
teaching them critical and analytical thinking skills in full alignment with state and national standards. Supported by 
and in collaboration with families and community members, we expect students to aim high by addressing the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

individual needs of diverse learners and by strengthening the development of a well-rounded child who is fully 
prepared for their educational complexities beyond elementary school. 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 34 is an elementary school with 471 students from Pre K through grade 5. The school population is comprised of 
5% Black, 18% Hispanic, 72% White, and 2% Asian students. The student body includes 13.7% English Language 
Learners and 12.5% Students with Disabilities.. Over the past year, the school has consistently communicated high 
expectations to the entire staff and provided trainings connected to the alignment of the Framework for Great 
Schools as well as ensuring students are exposed to a path to college and career readiness.  

 

The school’s high expectations result in a culture of mutual accountability and allows the school to successfully 
partner with families to support student progress and engagement. Collaboration with families is imperative to the 
school’s vision and educational philosophy and as a result, families feel very well supported by the school in preparing 
their children for life after PS34 and the next level of schooling. Families have numerous opportunities to contribute 
to the school community such as through the Parents Association and participating as Parent Volunteers in each 
classroom. In addition, the school partners with a variety of community based organizations to further enrich 
students’ academic as well as social and emotional growth in the following programs: Disney Theater Program, 
Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, Robotics Grant Program, BRIC, Studio in a School, American Ballroom Dancing, 
Periwinkle Theater, Eckford Street Studio, and others. 

 

The Danielson Framework for Teaching and the Citywide Instructional Shifts guide our daily practice and our teaching 
philosophy. In order to continue learning, our educators collaborate to effectively incorporate the eight components 
of the Danielson Framework to ensure individual student needs are consistently being met. To cultivate highly 
effective instruction, teachers engage students in purposeful lessons that meet the needs of individuals and create 
opportunities for small group instruction. Teachers regularly provide differentiated tasks in all their lesson plans for 
independent practices that incorporate multiple entry points for varied learning styles and preferences and they plan 
for extension activities for accelerated students. Additionally, students engage in Reciprocal Learning, Math 
Exemplars and project-based learning on a regular basis. Teachers are provided with feedback, based on the 
Danielson Rubric, that highlight their strengths, challenges, and the next steps needed to improve instructional 
outcomes. Using Danielson’s Framework supports our belief that effective instruction is a result of teachers being 
knowledgeable about and prepared to implement the academic content and for students to be active participants in 
their learning who are fully engaged in that content. The Danielson Framework helps us plan and formulate questions 
that ensure that we are meeting the needs of all students. 

 

Our school community employs a wide range of assessments aligned to curriculum and the Common Core Learning 
Standards for monitoring student progress and growth. Teachers use rubrics, checklists, periodic running records, and 
formative assessments, resulting in grouping students for targeted instruction.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

There is ongoing communication of high expectations to staff through a variety of means, such as a staff handbook; 
daily message; monthly newsletters; professional learning community and faculty meetings; verbal feedback on daily 
walkthroughs; modeling behaviors towards students and parents; and especially through observation reports. 
Feedback on Advance observations reveals high expectations for teacher practice, even where teachers are receiving 
Highly Effective and Effective ratings. 

 

Just as school leaders have high expectations, teachers insist on a culture of feedback and continuous improvement. 
The physical layout of the school, which has no corridors and doors opening from room to room, allows and 
encourages teachers to be open and welcoming to colleagues, and see each other’s best practices. Administrators 
expect teachers to visit each other, arrange for them to visit other schools, and encourage them to attend various 
professional development opportunities, through the District Office, the Borough Field Support Office, city-wide 
events and outside vendors. All adults are expected to learn, and to model excellence to students, families and 
colleagues. 

 

We established a collaborative professional learning environment that reflects the importance of teacher teams. Our 
prep schedule supports weekly grade level common planning, and vertical team meetings. Team meetings are 
focused on instructional goals, analysis of student work. planning and improving student achievement. Our Monday 
professional development time is devoted to teacher-led professional learning communities and in-house trainings 
aligned to the school and district instructional focus. 

 

PS 34 proudly partners with many community organizations that enhance the learning experience at the school. 
Those organizations include: Williamsburg Movement and Art, BRIC, Eckford Street Studios, Periwinkle Theater and 
many others. 

 

Three years ago we were awarded a grant through the Greenpoint Community Environmental Fund that provided the 
school with a full-time Sustainability Coach through the Nation Wildlife Federation. As part of this Eco-Schools 
program, PS 34 has reduced its energy usage, experienced a 80% reduction in waste and is now home to an innovative 
STEM program, as well as other green initiatives like a student-designed front yard and a thriving hydroponics lab in 
our STEM room. 

 

One of the many unique features of P.S. 34 is that it is home to New York City's first Polish Dual Language Program. 
With classes now being offered in grades K, 1, 2 and 3, the Dual Language Program has become a popular choice for 
families who are committed to engaging their children in the experience of becoming bilingual and being immersed in 
a challenging language environment every day. The Dual Language Program is taught by teachers who are fluent in 
Polish and it adheres to a 50/50 split of English and Polish instruction through the academic subject areas. We are 
excited to grow this program through the 5th grade in the next few years.

PS 34 is proud to be the home of New York City's first Polish Dual Language program. This program was initiated by 
parents who felt it was important to maintain the school's cultural identity while providing an opportunity for 
students to learn, speak and think in a 2nd language. The needs of our ELL population are met through ESL instruction 
in the classroom in the Dual Language Program and by a dedicated ESL teacher who meets the mandated needs of 
English Language Learners who are not in the Dual Language classes.  

This year we have ICT classes in grades 2, 4 and 5, with students in those rooms receiving instruction from a general 
education teacher as well as a special education teacher. Additionally, students who require SETSS services are having 
their needs met by a special education teacher throughout the day. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the end of March 2018, PS 34 was engaged in the rigorous Quality Review process. The reviewer for our school 
identified curriculum (1.1) and assessment (2.2) as two areas of strength for us within the Instructional Core, assigning 
a rating of "well developed" for each of these components. In the Framework for Great Schools rubric, this means 
that "Rigorous Instruction" was an areas were we made good progress over the past year. 

Our key area of focus for this school year will be "Collaborative Teachers." The Quality Reviewer named this as a 
proficient "Additional Finding" last March. He pointed out that regular participation in Professional Learning 
Communities results in "increased instructional capacity for teachers and access to the curricula for groups of 
students." This aligns with our school-wide instructional focus for the year which is: In order to develop analytical 
thinking through questioning and discussion, students in all K-5 classrooms will develop number sense and 
mathematical fluency through the strategic use and practice of number talks."

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) Template  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 34, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 34 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

Begin description here:            
  Oliver H. Perry PS 34 is an elementary school located in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.  We currently 
have 471 students from pre-kindergarten through grade 5. The school population comprises 5% 
Black,18% Hispanic, 72% White, and 2% Asian students. The student body includes 13% 
English language learners and 13% special education students.   At PS 34 we are committed to 
the academic success of every child. The school’s mission is to teach a rigorous academic 
curriculum, complemented by a wide range of engaging enrichment opportunities, inclusive of 
the arts, in a supportive and safe  environment. Our students are challenged to become lifelong 
learners who are well prepared for the demands of the 21st century. We believe the high 
expectations of today will nurture successful and productive citizens of tomorrow. As a 
community of professional learners we empower our students to grow academically by teaching 
them critical and analytical thinking skills in full alignment with state and national standards. 
Supported by and in collaboration with families and community members, we expect students to 
aim high by addressing the individual needs of diverse learners and by strengthening the 
development of a well rounded child who is fully prepared for the educational complexities 
beyond elementary school. PS 34 is a true community school where students, teachers, parents 
and community organizations work together. The school is located in a landmark building that 
was built in 1867 and the lay-out lends itself to open classrooms where hallways do not exist. We 
were named a National Blue Ribbon school and take great pride in the success of every child at 
PS 34.  We affirm, teach and celebrate the multicultural backgrounds of our children while 
instilling in them an appreciation for the diversity of all people.  We teach understanding and 
respect for racial, cultural and linguistic diversity.   Our mission is rooted in the commitment of 
developing inquisitive, critical thinkers who will embark on a lifelong journey of learning. This 
commitment ensures that every student from every ethnic group, income or achievement level 
receives a standard-setting education. 
After School Program: PS 34 will provide ELLs in grades K-5 with an after school program in 
English/Polish/Spanish that supports them in building up their native language skills.   This after 
school program will take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:45 through 4:00 PM. 
There will be 3 groups that will be led by two Polish speaking teachers and one Spanish speaker, 
comprised of approximately 20 students each. In addition to learning about their native 
languages, students will explore relevant cultural experiences that will enhance their 
understanding of their culture. The program will begin in November and will last for 
approximately 25 sessions.  A variety of materials are used from the common core aligned 
programs used during the day as well as additional supplementary instructional materials. 
# and types of certified teachers: Two ESL/Bil certified teachers will co-teach with the 1 content 
area teacher. The ESL teachers will push into each class for 40 minutes to service the ELL 
students and co-teach as well. 
Saturday Program: There will be additional Saturday classes for grades 2-3 during January 
through April from 9am until 12pm that will provide supplementary instructional support for the 
NYSESLAT and the NYS ELA and Math tests. The language of instruction during these 8-10

  Teachers will receive workshops on second language acquisition through  teacher team 
meetings where they will plan rigorous lessons that are Common Core aligned. In addition, Dual 
Language teachers are participating in a district-wide Professional Development Collaborative 
Share program every Monday throughout the year. Professional development is led by the 
literacy coach, building administrators the network ELL specialist, and specialists throughout  at 
no cost to Title III. They will focus on scaffolds, language structures and planning. Records will 
be maintained through agendas and attendance sheets. Professional development schedule is as

  PS 34 recognizes that parents are our children’s first teachers.  Research shows that students 
who have involved parents perform better and achieve more academically.  We work closely 
with the community-based organizations to provide our parents with education classes, health 
programs and other services.  We currently host a variety of workshops.   PS 34 works hard to 
have a school environment that is a welcoming and warm one for parents of all language and 
cultural groups.  Parents know bilingualism is valued and there is a sense of belonging for 
students and their families.   We also make special efforts to encourage parental involvement in 
children's learning experiences.   We found that the most effective parental workshops were

those where parents were actively engaged in the activities and the activities were connected to 
their lives.  We would use funds from this grant to expand our parent education 
program.  Parents will meet once a month and engage in learning activities in their native 
language and/or English such as Read Alouds, Word Study, Math Games or Science experiments 
in their child’s classroom.   We would also use the services of BRIC to enhance their writing 
through illustrations using computer technology.  Parents will self publish books about their life, 
family or culture.   The workshops will be led by the teachers and facilitators from 
BRIC.  Materials to be purchased include painting materials, drawing materials, and blank 
books.  We anticipate that parents that participate in the program will become familiar with 
writing strategies with which to encourage and nurture their child’s strengths and interests and 
improve their own writing literacy.   Funds will be used to provide the opportunity for parents to 
join classes on educational trips throughout the year.  In addition, we will host an ELL Showcase 
in May.  Parents will be invited to view student work and speak to them about their projects. 
Parents of students enrolled in our Dual Language classes are invited to informational workshops 
to keep them apprised of concerns such as state testing and middle school applications. Holidays 
Around the World, in accordance with the Chancellor's priority to promote inclusiveness, is a 
community-wide initiative that will take place in mid-December and will celebrate the language 
and culture of many of the students represented in our school.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessments our school uses to determine the level of the early literacy skills development of our ELLs include Fountas and 
Pinnell running records along with additional Fountas and Pinnell tools for the grade level specific specific literacy skills 
development. For example, we utilize word lists, high-frequency word lists, phonogram, and word feature checklists. In 
addition, we use informal assessment (teacher created checklists, observations, and conference notes) to keep track of our 
students progress.  Also, twice a year our school uses the ELA MOSL performance in grades K through 5.  The evaluation of the 
data derived from these assessments provides teachers with valuable information about the strengths and challenges  of the 
ELL students in the area of literacy.  Based on the individual needs of each student, we set short and long term instructional 
goals and plan for necessary scaffolds and levels of support in the classroom and standalone ENL program.  Additionally, we 
assess all students using the built-in assessment offered by our literacy curriculum in grades K-2, the Core Knowledge 
Language Arts program to monitor progress frequently..

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our program for ELLs is measured by the results on the NYSESLAT and NYS English Language Arts exam. While 
the assessment results  indicate individual student progress,  our ultimate goal is to achieve the proficient/commanding level 
on the NYSESLAT  and level 3 or above on the NYS ELA exams for each of our ELL student in grade 3-5.  To ensure ELL students' 
success the ENL teachers, in collaboration with classroom teachers and related service providers (for ELL-SWDs), develop 
adequate short and long term goals for all ELL students which affects  unit and lesson planning. School data derived from 
formative assessment indicates that our ELL students make satisfactory gains in developing oral language,  including academic 
vocabulary and their writing shows better quality, as evidenced by rubrics and portfolio review. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
During our weekly Inquiry Meetings, data collected for targeted ELL students is analyzed and discussed regarding students 
needs. This data is used to plan lessons, develop goals for the individual students, monitor progress,  and make 
recommendations for further interventions if necessary.  For each student who scored below expected levels of performance 
on the annual English language proficiency assessment, we conduct a thorough review of student academic data to determine 
the additional support services to provide the student. The school RTI plan includes tiered interventions for ELLs.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
A review of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT test results identifies ELLs at every grade level. The NYSITELL results show that 1/3 of 
the ELL students reach the expanding level demonstrating  relatively strong listening and speaking skills. About 50% of the 
students assessed with the NYSITELL scored at the commanding level.  Upon reviewing the NYSESLAT test results for our ELL 
students in grades K-5, certain patterns were observed for second language acquisition.  The language acquisition appears in 
the following order  of mastery: listening and speaking competency is attained first, followed by reading, lastly writing. Looking 
at the individual scores of our entering level ELLs it was evident across all grade levels that the scores for listening and 
speaking were consistently higher as compared to the other two modalities.  At the transitioniong level, our ELL students 
showed most improvement in reading and writing with the writing score being slightly lower than the reading score. This was 
clearly evident among students in grades 1 through 5. Our expanding level students continued to show improvement across all 
four modalities.  Our instructional goals and objectives are planned accordingly in keeping with this consistent pattern across 
proficiencies and grade level. Our high achieving and English Proficient ELL’s receive instruction in flexible groups to address 
their needs . 
  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

  
        Our Freestanding ENL program is implemented in both pull out and push in models.  The pull out groups are 
homogeneous  and contain students from contiguous grade levels.  In the push in model, the ENL teacher delivers the 
service in heterogenous groups in the student's classrooms.  Our ELL students are programmed in STARS and serviced 
as described by CR 154.

 DL Polish Kindergarten program -  instruction is delivered in a self-contained model with one ENL bilingual Polish 
teacher who provides  instruction in both languages English and Polish at separate times.  Our DL is designed in the 
Half-Day variant of the 50:50 model. The class comprises of 15 ELL students and 9 English proficient students who are 
interested in learning Polish. In this DL Polish class we integrate students learn the target language through content 
areas as well as through literacy.  The primary language acquisition goal of the program is the development of grade-
level-appropriate bilingual and biliterate academic skills in both English and Polish. We provide all students in this 
class with the academically rigorous curriculum in both languages to enable the students to meet or ecceed New York 
State and City standards.  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                               We cross-referenced NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores and ENL program schedules to ensure that mandated 
minutes are provided                    to all ELL students by proficiency level.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Core content is delivered by the classroom teachers and ENL teachers.  All staff members receive ongoing training on 
scaffolding, sheltered instruction, and other forms of instruction for ELLs. This year, as outlined by CR 154, 50% of professional 
development for the ENL teachers and 15% for all other teachers will be devoted to effective instructional strategies for ELL 
students.  
        Instructional strategies for ELL students are aligned with rigorous grade-level expectations articulated by the Common 
Core Language State Standards for English language arts and mathematics.  
All ENL classes follow a carefully structured instructional approach that develops literacy skills in the four language modalities: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

speaking, listening, reading, and writing. This is accomplished through a variety of activities that include but are not limited to: 
        - read alouds 
        - shared reading, guided reading, and independent reading 
        - phonemic awareness and phonics activities 
        - shared writing, guided writing, and independent writing 
        - building of grammatical structures   
        Additionally, carefully selected scaffolds are incorporated into every lesson.  During bi-weekly common planning time 
and  Professional Learning Communities sessions, the ENL teachers and classroom teachers determine which scaffolds will 
meet individual student's needs. These scaffolds include picture supports, language experience charts, sentence and 
paragraph frames, and other supports included in the core ELA programs, CKLA and Expeditionary Learning.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Individual plans for SIFE and Long Term ELLs are developed based on gathering and analyzing student's data. 
1.  Thorough assessment of the student's needs based on data retrieved from ATS conducted by the ENL teacher(s), school 
counselor and school administrators 
2.  Additional formal and informal assessment administered by the ENL teacher, members of the RTI Team and classroom 
teachers to identify the student levels of performance and areas in need of improvement.  
3.  Based on the assessment results frequency and intensity of interventions are planned for each student. 
We differentiate instruction for all other ELL subgroups as follows: 
1.  Grouping ELL students according to their level of language acquisition including curriculum compacting 
2.  Utilizing a variety of materials appropriate for each group of students  
3.  Focusing on addressing Common Core Language Standards 
4.  Using supports included in the core programs, Core Knowledge Language Arts and Expeditionary Learning  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All teachers and paraprofessionals have access to their students' IEPs which are carefully analyzed in collaboration with the 
special education teachers and related service providers of each student. Our ELL-SWDs are programmed in general education 
and ICT classes where they have full access to the content and core curriculum. Additionally, carefully selected supports are 
implemented in the general education classroms and ENL classes. 
 Instructional strategies for ELL-SWDs are aligned with rigorous grade-level expectations articulated by the Common Core 
Language State Standards for English language arts and mathematics. The ENL teachers build on students language and literacy 
knowledge and skills that our ELLs (including ELL-SWDs) demonstrate. Taking advantage of the strengths and skills that these 
students bring to the classroom improves their acquisition of language and literacy skills in a second language.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to identify specific needs that are critical to meeting the challenge of individual differences of ELL-SWDs, we 
implement our knowledge from the rich professional development offered by the school and District Office.  In our 
instructional practices, we adapt the Universal Design for Learning strategies as well as the Depth of Knowledge questioning 
techniques. These approaches enable ELL-SWDs to access the grade-level material and provide them with an opportunity for 
developing higher-order thinking skills. For example, all students, including ELL-SWDs in grades 2-5 participate in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

heterogeneous reciprocal teaching groups in their classrooms which facilitate full access to grade-level material and boost 
their vocabulary development and reading comprehension .   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELLs who have been in the ENL program longer than 3 consecutive years and who scored at the low intermediate level on the 
NYSESLAT are one of the target subgroups for academic interventions in ELA, Social Studies, Science and math.  Analysis of 
their assessments (formative and summative) indicate that this subgroup needs language support in vocabulary development 
and writing.   ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers during weekly grade level inquiry teams' conferences on 
developing best practices and supports for these students. The strategies include but are not limited to graphic organizers, 
visual aides, dictionaries (bilingual and monolingual), charts, word families, and frontloading of the vocabulary. ENL teachers 
set goals, list strategies, and monitor students' progress.  In writing, ENL teachers usually work alongside with the classroom 
teachers to support their students in all aspects of the writing process. Our SETSS/Academic Intervention Services teacher 
further supports the needs of the identified ELL students  by providing direct instruction in their areas of weakness.  Because 
both ENL teachers and the AIS provider are bilingual Polish, they offer home language support in Polish, specifically in reading 
and text comprehension and vocabulary in all subject areas.  Additionally, we closely monitor progress of the students in the 
Kindergarten Dual Program to identify early intervwentions as needed.  Classroom  teachers use high interest lower level non-
fiction texts to work with identified targeted ELLs.  In addition, our bilingual paraprofessionals offer support to the ENL staff. 
Moreover, Bilingual Social Studies, Science, and Math glossaries, are available in several languages and translated in-house to 
Polish. These tools are used by classroom and ENL teachers to support English Language Learners, especially in upper 
grades.  Classroom teachers are trained in ENL methodologies, provide language support in all content areas by the 
implementation of flexible grouping and student partnerships.  Parent volunteers facilitate content learning for an ELL who 
speaks a low frequency first language (In the past, we used French, Polish, and Arabic speaking volunteers).  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

1.  Dual Language Polish program in Kindergarten 
2.  STEM - the enrichment program in grades K-5 that provides our students with an opportunity  to solve real world problems.  
In the STEM units of study,  Ms. Marshall integrates  science, technology, engineering, and math. The teacher is working closely 
with our Sustanability Coach, Tina Wong, to assure the alignment with the Greenpoint Eco-Schools project. 
3.  The Greenpoint Eco-Schools project supports our school in creating an environmental education program . The 
Sustainability Coach,  is leading this initiative alongside with the school leaders.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our schools offers all ELLs equal access to school academic and extracurricular programs. Each grade level has a daily schedule 
of academic and enrichment programs and activities.  All program cards and flow of the day charts are posted in the 
classrooms.  All ELLs are held to the same high standards and expectations of the school.  Therefore, if an ESL pull-out service is 
scheduled,it is done in collaboration with classroom teachers and must be approved by a supervisor to assure the least 
disruption to a child's academic learning.  All ELLs are always included in program invitation letters sent home and translated 
to Polish and Spanish.  Parents of all students are invited to Open House and Open Door events to learn about academic 
curriculum. They are informed about extracurricular programs via letters, Principal's Bulletins, and the school website.  The 
following are the programs, in addition to academic ones, that ELLs participate in: 1st and 2nd grade dance, K-5 enrichment 
program in visual arts and science, 5th grade ballroom dance and all senior activities, music with the Brooklyn Conservatory of 
music in grades K, 1, 3 and 4, class trips, school-wide Character Counts Program, and many others.  The following are 
supplemental programs that are offered this school year:  Saturday Academy for grades 3-5 (Title III and Title I funding 
sources), After School Enrichment Program with Brooklyn Conservatory of Music.  Our goal is to increase student achievement 
in ELA and math and to support enrichment programs for all students, including ELLs.  In addition, the school houses an OST

Program with The School Settlement CBO which offers after school and many ELLs and their families take advantage of this 
program. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In literacy instruction we use CKLA in grades K-2 and Expeditionary Learning in grades 3-5. Go Math is used across the grade 
levels at PS 34. The STEM program utilizes technology on a daily basis. In addition we utilize supports and scaffolds built-in for 
ELLs in the core programs as well as computers, IPads and smart boards.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ELL students use their native language freely with bilingual personnel and parent volunteers and among themselves.  They can 
express their academic needs and ask for clarification. Books in native languages are available for students to take out on loan. 
In addition, students are supported by glossaries in content areas, picture and non-picture dictionaries, and support staff.  
In the Dual Language Polish program students have an opportunity to use the target language for 50% of their school day.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required service support and resources correspond to the ELLs age and grade level work.  ENL teachers use a variety of 
instructional materials that are grade level and age appropriate.  Our anchor ELA programs (CKLA in grades K-2 and 
Expeditionary Learning in grades 3-5) have built-in instructional and assessment components for ELLs on each grade level. use 
leveled libraries for guided reading and building reading fluency.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
In literacy instruction we use CKLA in grades K-2 and Expeditionary Learning in grades 3-5. Go Math is used across the grade 
levels at PS 34. The STEM program utilizes technology on a daily basis. In addition we utilize supports and scaffolds built-in for 
ELLs in the core programs as well as computers, IPads and smart boards.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the beginning of the school year, newly enrolled ELLs are screened by either ENL licensed teachers and/or grade level 
teacher and during this time parents' questions are answered and students have an opportunity to meet 
teachers.  Additionally, when new ELLs are admited they are greeted by the Principal or AP and often a classroom teacher 
welcomes the child.  ENL teachers give a school tour to newly enrolled ELLs.  Their parents receive the Parent Handbook and 
our school's website address (the website is parent friendly and has a translation feature).  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer Polish language to ELLs in the Dual Language Polish program.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Our DL Polish Kindergarten instructional program is delivered in a self-contained model.  In this model, 
there is one teacher who provides  instruction in both languages English and Polish at separate times. The 
class comprises of 14 ELLs with mixed proficiency levels and 9 EP students.  Our DL is designed in the Half-
Day variant of the 50:50 model.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
As outlined by the District 14 leaders, our professional plan for all ELL personnel is based on the premises of reflective 
practice.   
All teachers are given opportunities to: 
- Have information on content and its classroom application 
- Have time to construct knowledge and understanding of the new information 
- Have time to implement, practice, and assess the newly learned information 
- Have time and opportunities to share and reflect on their newly acquired knowledge 
- Realign, restructure, and practice based on their reflections and professional knowledge  
ENL, classroom teachers, and cluster teachers are offered several opportunities to participate in professional development 
throughout the school year.  Our PD plan includes the development of instructional supports to ensure that the ELL students 
meet the Common Core Learning standards.  Our focus topics are as follows: 
- Universal Design for Learning principles and resources including multiple entry points approach 
- questioning techniques derived from Depth of Knowledge as a tool to increase instructional rigor 
- strategies for developing academic vocabulary (for example through reciprocal teaching) 
- scaffolding instruction for ELLs with the use of "Scaffolding Instruction for English Language Learners: Resource Guides for 
ELA and Mathematics" by Diane August and Diane Stehr Fenner 
In addition, select teachers will paricipate in professional development oferred by the District Office. Our District leaders 
provide opportunities to participate in the following study groups: 
1.  The Power of Two  (planning and implementation of high quality Dual Language program using research-based practices) 
2.  New Teacher Study Group 
3.  Teacher Leader Study Group 
Furthermore, our teachers will attend professional development oferred by DELLSS throughout the year in person and/or via 
online webinars and videos.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The following staff is involved in the articulation process and student transition from elementary to middle school:  5th grade 
teachers (E. Krakower-Larkin, L. Brown, A. Panopoulos, and J. Brahmstedt), SETSS provider, I. Borys, ENL Coordinator, 
Aleksandra Pietrusiewicz,  Principal, Carmen Asselta, Parent Coordinator, D. Kowalski, Pupil Accounting Secretary, E. Tabala. 
Our part-time   guidance counselor, Lisa Bargognone, supports the process.  Every year, we invite the parents of 5th grade 
students to participate in our own Middle School Fair where they can meet representatives from local middle schools.  Parents 
of ELLs and F-ELLs have an opportunity to participate and learn about options for their children.  If we have a first-year ELL in 
the 5th grade, the Principal guides the family through the process.  5th grade teachers take their classes on tours to the local 
middle schools and many parents of ELLs and F-Ells accompany their children. The Principal personally monitors the 
articulation process and works closely with the Pupil Accounting Secretary, 5th grade teachers, and parents.  Mrs. Asselta 
assists ELLs as they transition to middle schools and supports teachers and personnel in this process.  
ALL teachers are engaged in weekly professional development on Mondays where scaffolds and supports for ELLs are included 
on the agenda. This year, teachers have an opportunity to participate in the Professional Learning Communities that will study 
instructional practices for ELLs and SWDs.  In addition, we attend workshops offered by the Borough Field Support Center and 
participate in study groups led by the District Office specialist, Cynthia Felix.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In order to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and 
language development needs we start scheduling annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs in October.  The ENL 
teachers in collaboration with the admionistration, classroom teachers, paraprofessionals and special education providers (if 
applicable) reach out to parents in their preferred language via telephone, email and invitation letters.  (We use surveys to 
determine parents' preferred way of communication.)  Meetings are held before, during, and after school hours depending on 
the parent choice. During the meeting, each parent has an opportunity to learn about their child's academic progress in regard 
to the language development as well as ask questions about the program. Parents are accommodated with interpretation 
services as needed.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our Parent Coordinator encourages the parents to take an active role in educating our children to improve academic 
achievement of our students through meetings, workshops,  and other forms of communication.  School in-house surveys are 
provided in the most common languages spoken by the parents. Translations are provided by teachers, paraprofessionals, and 
parent volunteers. All parents, including parents of ELLs, are encouraged to actively participate in their children’s educational 
process and school activities such as assemblies, shows, workshops, Open House, Open Door, parent partnership 
program,  trips, School Leadership Teams, Parent Teacher Association, fundraisers, etc. Additionally, parents of the students in 
lower grades meet at school several times during the year to participate in special events, such as TheThanksgiving Feast 
(Kindergarten) or building ginger-bread houses (Grade One and Kindergarten). In upper grades, parents are invited to the 
Curriculum Showcase where students' projects and presentations are demonstrated to the parents on a select unit of study. All 
parents are invited to participate in Multicultural/Family Nights.  Our parents are also active participants in Kindergarten and 1        
st       Grade Orchestra. Grade Four invites parents to Poetry Café where poems are presented not only in English but other 
languages as well. Grade Five parents have the opportunity to participate in the Ballroom Dance presentation. Grade Three 
students play the recorders for the Flag Day in front of all the parents and many other guests. Parent volunteers are invited to 
work alongside with teachers in the student classroom on all grade levels.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carmen Asselta, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

According to ATS reports, currently 14.25% of PS 34 students are English Language Learners. The results from this 
year's Home Language Survey (HLIS) and information provided by the parents on the emergency cards reveal that 
many parents of our ELLs speak languages other than English at home and come from a variety of linguistic 
backgrounds (predominantly Polish but also Spanish, Chinese and Arabic and many more). Teachers and parents 
have frequently asked for assistance in facilitating oral and written communication between the school and home.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

These meetings occur before, after 
school, and every Tuesday afternoon 
(during parent involvement time). In 
addition, we also accommodate

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

P.S. 34 has a multilingual welcome poster displayed in the main office to make every visitor aware of language 
assistance services. Language I.D. guides are kept in at the security office as well as the main office. Information for 
parents on the NYC DOE's translation and interpretation services are available in 10 languages, and is kept at the 
security desk and main office. Parents' Bill of Rights are sent to the school is a variety of languages and they are 
distributed upon arrival to all parents who have indicated a preferred language other than English. All members of the 
school staff are aware of language assistance services provided by the school by using data ( ATS Reports, Blue Cards 
and Surveys), updated roster of bilingual staff and The Translation and Interpretation Unit Services.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parent surveys are distributed at the beginning of the year which gather feedback from parents on the quality and 
availability of services. During individual meetings with parents of ELLs, the ENL teachers have an opportunity to 
ascertain the needs and concerns that may be expressed. Then, the ENL teacher confers with the parent coordinator 
and/or the classroom teachers in order to discuss the needs of the parents/guardians and students. In order to gather 
feedback from parents, we are creating a focus group of multilingual and multicultural parents to discuss their needs 
and the needs of their children. We also communicate with the School Leadership Team that is represented by 
parents from a variety of linguistic backgrounds in order to improve our Translation and Interpretation plan and 
practices.
