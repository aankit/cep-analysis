Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS/MS 164’s mission is to implement a comprehensive, high quality, standards and data driven instructional program 
infused with technology, the Arts, and citizenship. We work to capitalize on the interests, talents and learning styles 
of our students and address each child’s needs academically, socially, and emotionally. Our Instructional Focus is, 
"Use formative assessment practices to improve student performance and conceptual understanding by ensuring 
there are ample opportunities for students to engage in rich discussions, tasks, and questions." Our social emotional 
focus is, "To recognize how our emotions drive teaching and learning." 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Our school is a Pre-K through 8 school located in the Kew Garden Hills section of Queens. It houses two full day Pre-K 
classes, three Kindergarten classes and 2-3 classes accordingly in Grades 1 through Grade 8. We offer accelerated 
coursework in grade 8 which include Regents classes in Earth Science, US History, Algebra, and the Proficiency Exam in 
Spanish. There are Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) classes on grades K, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. In addition, the 
school has a K/1, 3/4, 5/6, 7/8 12:1:1 special education classes.  

With 65% of our students eligible for free lunch; and 17% ENL students, we face the many challenges that other Title I 
schools face in New York City. Our most unique characteristic is the complexity of a PK-8 building. However, in spite of 
our complexity, there is a culture where students feel safe and supported, parents feel included and valued, and staff 
works tirelessly toward our continued success and improvement.  

PS/MS 164 has valuable instructional and artistic programs that enhance the cultural, academic and social/emotional 
well-being of the students. Our curriculum is steeped in the Common Core State Standards utilizing a workshop 
model. Our Instructional focus centers our vision and craft on student achievement realized through the efforts of the 
entire school community and the components of the Framework for Great Schools. 

We are long standing partners for science with Urban Advantage, Budding Scientists, the Hall of Science and in 
mathematics with the Algebra for All initiative. We are proud to continue our partnership with Inside Broadway 
through the CASA Grant for after-school arts, as well as Ballet Tech. 2016-2017 school year we have expanded our 
"Talent" programs to include Publishing and Technology. We are partnered with the Community Based Organization 
SONYC; through the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council, and have worked together to align its programs to support the 
school’s instructional goals and long-range action plans, including classes in STEM, music, and leadership. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

SWD are supported based on Individual Educational Plans; accommodations include, but are not, limited to visual 
supports, audio supports, movement breaks, technology and assisting devices, extended and modified tasks. For 
example, students in grades 3-5 need more focused instruction in reading comprehension skills and structures 
instruction to improve writing skills.  

ENL Learners are supported by needs based on their proficiency level as indicated on the NYSESLAT Exam. Supports 
include but are not limited to Imagine Learning web based system for language development, visual cues in the 
class/content setting and scaffold task which support vocabulary as needed. For example, ENL students have a specific 
need for a more structured writing support and language development program. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The 2018-19 Instructional Focus will center around the use of formative assessment practices to improve student 
performance and conceptual understanding by ensuring there are ample opportunities for students to engage in rich 
discussions, tasks, and questions. To accomplish this, Professional Learning Communities will collaborate to reflect 
upon and refine instruction to meet the needs of all learners and to develop conceptual models to explain big ideas 
and concepts in all subject areas. In addition to the Instructional Focus our school is developing a Social Emotional 
focus that will support teachers "To recognize how our emotions drive teaching and learning."  

Our staff will be focusing on Professional Development opportunities which will continue to build coherence 
throughout the building Pre K- Grade 8. Incorporating, school-wide Positive Behavior Intervention System (PBIS),

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, P.S./M.S. 164's strengths include providing a safe environment 
whereby 83% of students feel safe in both the school and in their classes and 70% of students agreed or strongly 
agreed that they have peer support for academic work. Both indicators outperformed the citywide average and 
demonstrate evidence that opportunities for collaboration are happening within the classroom in a safe environment.  

2. The priority need that will be addressed for the 2018-2019 school year will personal attention and support, as only 
61% of students responded positively, based on the date form the 2017-18 School Quality Guide. To improve in this 
area our school will continue to develop a social emotional curriculum including workshops on Growth Mindset.  

3. Beginning with Respect For All, P.S./M.S. 164 believes in having "PRIDE", which stands for positive respectful 
individuals determined everyday. We have integrated this motto into PBIS and our SEL curriculum. The schedule 
allows for selected teachers to work with small groups of students in areas of need that are grounded in SEL. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, the School Quality Guide will show a 5% increase in Personal Attention and Support through Social 
Emotional Learning opportunities in and outside of the classroom.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
To support the transition for preschool children to the elementary program, the curriculum is aligned to the CCLS and 
develops the foundational skills needed for kindergarten through hands on, experiential learning. Vertical planning 
sessions are held to build coherence between Pre-K and Kindergarten to ensure readiness of preliminary skills. 
Workshops are provided for parents to learn about elementary school readiness, and Social Worker conducts 
professional learning sessions to inform parents about social emotional skills to support the transition to 
kindergarten. Teachers will use the authentic, work sampling to monitor student growth in all the developmental 
areas and provide the information to kindergarten teachers. Teachers perform the ESI-R to target students in need of 
early intervention services. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Instructional Team, in conjunction with teacher input, determined the need to use MOSL assessments as they are 
aligned to the ELA and mathematics curricula, and provide teachers with valuable information regarding student 
growth. Grade level teacher teams collaborate to determine formative and summative assessments within each unit 
of study in all subject areas to measure student growth. Professional development is ongoing, beginning with how to 
analyze, disaggregate, and interpret State Assessment data through the Item Analysis to determine strengths and 
areas in need of improvement. Teachers used this information to reflect of previous year’s instruction and plan for the 
needs of current students on their roster. Teacher Leads provide professional development to analyze, disaggregate, 
and interpret data from formative and MOSL assessments using to identify needs of all students, including ENLs, 
students with disabilities, STH, and other subgroups to improve instruction. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/MS 164, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS/MS 164 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

To ensure that the ENL students meet the NYS Next Generation Learning Standards, develop the 
academic language necessary for content area success, and pass the required assessments for 
their grade, we will continue to provide direct instruction and support for 15 Transitioning 
ELLs,19 Expanding ELLs, and 25 FELLs (Commanding) in grades 2-5. Students were targeted 
using data from the NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell reading levels, STARS Assessment, 
student writing samples, as well as the NYS ELA and Math assessments. Our NYS ELA data 
shows that 0% of all ENL students tested at or above the state standard (level 3 or 4) and 100% 
of ELLs performed below the state standard (level 1 &2). Our grade 2-5 ELLs were determined 
to need additional support in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Additionally, our 
FELLs are included in the population to be served because, although they have tested proficient 
on the NYSESLAT, there continues to be an achievement gap between this subgroup and general 
education students. We decided to target all four modalities for these two subgroups through a 
language rich performance based program which capitalizes on the students willingness to 
perform in a theater setting. Three certified ENL teachers and two content area 
teachers (depending on student enrollment) will be hired to work with students two days a week 
for one and a half hours per day. Each teacher additionally holds a Common Branch 1-6 license 
to support content area learning. Each teacher will be responsible for different grades (1, 2, 3-4 
and 5-6). The ratio of certified ENL teachers to students will be 1:15 and each class. The 24 
sessions will begin in November and run through March from 2:30-4:00PM. Teachers will take 
attendance at the beginning of every session. Teachers will also be responsible for recording the 
parent's preferred language and making sure all notices are distributed with translated versions. 
The strengthening of the four areas of listening/speaking and reading/ writing will be realized 
through the use of theater activities and play writing. Students who are capable of reading and 
writing in their home language are allowed to do so. Language will be developed and 
strengthened  through academic conversations and fiction/nonfiction writing based on the 
Common Core State Standards and performance. Materials such as plays and children's literature 
will support language growth with access to the CCSS in the four modalities. We support the 
home language by using texts from different cultures. This enables the students who are native to 
those countries to share vocabulary and experiences with the rest of the students. Emphasis will 
be on ongoing evaluation of student performance and growth and the maintenance of tier 2 and 3 
vocabulary.  All supplemental materials including Materials for ELA and Math by Curriculum 
Associates for close reading, writing, and problem solving will support student growth and 
student achievement.  
Additionally, our grade 1-6 Entering and Emerging students will be supported at home through a 
supplemental program known as Imagine Learning. This program has embedded home language 
support; instructions and stories are read in the student's home language. Teachers monitor the 
students' use and progress through online reports of performance. We use data from these reports 
to provide additional targeted instruction and intervention.

  Professional development is provided in Math and ELA one period a week for classroom/ELA 
teachers and during team meetings and during the dedicated professional learning on Mondays. 
Ongoing professional learning will also be provided on Election and Brooklyn Queens Day and 
through teacher teams and the review of student work. Looking at our data from the 2015-
16 NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and Math assessments, we decided that our teachers need coaching 
in the areas of task writing, language development, and the CCSS and how it relates to our ENL 
and FELL population. 
Our teachers participate in Professional Learning Sessions facilitated by Instructional Leads at 
the Borough (BFSN) support specialist will provide a series of workshops supporting research-
based approaches to supporting ELL comprehension and participation using grade level complex 
text. 
After school teacher teams will have built in time on Mondays and Tuesdays from 2:30pm-
3:45pm to review student writing/output  and next steps. Every provider will hand out an agenda 
that outlines the session, as well as the session's connection to the instruction of ELLs, and will 
record the attendance of the participants.  In addition, our teachers will use the materials and 
information from the U.S. Department of Education New Comer Toolkit for Professional 
Development.   
In house Professional Development and Borough opportunities will be 
held during the mandated school day for teachers and will be of no cost to Title III;
however teachers may attend Professional Learning outside of the Borough menu if 
offered including but not limited to a National Conference to participate in best practices.

The major languages at the school are Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Bengali, and Gujurati.  We 
find that the parents of ENLs/FELLs need to be able to help their children with their school work 
as well as to understand student expectations. 
We also want parents to feel welcomed and comfortable in our PTA activities. Topics will 
include : The CCSS: What it means for you and your child,  Access to materials, translations and 
translators. Assessments students will be taking NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and Math and how 
parents can provide support.  These activities will support our Title III  goals by instructing 
ENL/FELL parents in ways to support their children and help them to be successful students. In 
addition, we will collaborate with our Parent Coordinator to plan parent literacy events and 
workshops.  We will also host a meet and greet for parents of incoming students providing 
families with important resources and information.  Finally, we will provide translators at all of 
our workshops and events so that all parents have accessibility to the information.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS/MS 164 uses a variety of assessments to assess the skills of our English Language Learners (ELL) population and guide our 
instructional planning. The formative assessments we use across all grades are checklists, exit-slips, self-checklists, and 
conferencing. In grades K-5 teachers use Fountas & Pinnell Reading Assessments to assess reading skills, including fluency, 
accuracy, and comprehension. Grade K-4 teachers also use the Teacher's College (TC) Units of Study implementing the 
Balanced Literacy Model. Grade 3-8 teachers use Stars Reading  and Math assessments which are computer-based 
assessments that assess reading comprehension and math fluency. Grade 6-8 teachers also use Expeditionary Learning and 
Code-X curricula, which incorporate text-dependent questions. Grades K-8 also use TC Writing Pathways rubrics and Stars 
Assessments. These assessments are used throughout the year to gauge student understanding and language development. 
Teachers can then adjust their lessons to meet the needs of English as a New Language(ENL) students.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

PS/MS 164 is working towards building formative assessment practices throughout the grade levels. This year our school 
instructional focus is to Use Formative Assessment Practices to improve student 
performance and  Conceptual Understanding by ensuring ample opportunities for students to engage in rich discussions, tasks, 
and questions.  Through this effort all teachers are being trained in effective formative assessment practices that will allow 
them to plan instruction to meet the needs of all students. ENL teachers are going to professional learning opportunities held 
by the Queens North Field Support Center. Teacher teams are working to analyze data, and implement strategies to make 
improvements to our teaching.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use summative assessments and baseline assessments across all grade levels. All grades use writing pathways On Demand 
Assessments in all three genre types in the beginning as a baseline and at the end as a summative assessment to 
determine growth. In grades K-4 teachers administer the Fountas & Pinnell Reading Assessments to determine independent 
reading levels and skills.  In grades 3-8 teachers administer the STARS Assessment in ELA and Math as a baseline as well as a 
mid year and end of year assessment to monitor students progress.  In grades 6-8, teachers use informational, literary, and 
argumentative writing tasks. Grades 3-8 analyze the results from the New York State English Language Arts and Math exams. 
ENL teachers analyze NYSESLAT results to monitor progress in reading, writing, speaking and listening.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, a team of teachers (the AIS team), administrators and related service providers 
meet to analyze the data.   They decide on an intervention plan for students that are performing at risk in ELA and/or 
Math.  The following programs are provided for intervention: iRead, Imagine Learning, Rewards for Grades 6-8, Leveled 
Literacy Intervention System, and Wilson.  They review data from state wide assessments as well as formative assessments to 
determine which students need intervention and decide which intervention program would be suitable for their needs.   The 
team collaborates with classroom teachers to monitor the progress of such intervention.  Also, teachers collaborate during 
common planning time on grade level and/or in vertical teacher teams  to analyze student work and data and decide on 
strategies to implement within the classroom to address student needs.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Important information is gathered, analyzed and used to make instructional decisions throughout the year.  We use several 
data sources such as, the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), NYS ELA & Math exam results, NYSESLAT, formative and summative 
assessment.  We meet the needs of our students through rigorous and standard based curriculum. If a student or a group of 
students demonstrates a need for more targeted and intensive academic support we provide that in the classroom. The ENL 
teacher and the classroom teacher decide on specific learning targets based on the students’ needs. In addition, ENL teachers 
collaborate with the content teachers to plan lessons with scaffolded supports to meet the needs of all ELLs. As referenced in 
the RtI (Response to Intervention) guide for ELLs, ENL teachers build upon the linguistic capabilities that students bring to the 
classroom and try to understand where challenges may lie. If a student is not showing sufficient progress, the RtI team is 
informed and will take steps to give the student a more intensive intervention. The student's progress is monitored during the 
intervention program.  In addition, ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to use the Common Core Language Arts 
Progressions  to design scaffolds for students based on the information gathered from assessments.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data is collected from various assessments, including the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math state exams. This data is compiled in the 
ELL Data Analysis Tool. We use it to identify student levels on the NYSESLAT, as well as notice trends based on years in the 
program, attendance, and other risk factors. This tool gives an overview of each child and informs our ELL program. 
Furthermore, we also look at data regarding the students that are at risk and/or long term ELLs. We use this information to 
plan instruction to support their needs in all modalities.  We analyze the EDAT data to determine students with high risk 
factors and analyze the reasons for those risks stated within the comment section.  ENL teachers collaborate with the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

classroom teachers and parents of those students with a risk factor of 3 or above to plan instruction that meets the needs of 
those students as well as provide a monitored plan for progress in ELA and Math.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ENL team looks at the findings from the ELL Data Analysis Tool and uses that data to make adjustments to our ENL 
program. We group students based on their level and using the ELL Data Analysis Tool take into consideration the risk factors. 
The ENL teachers use data based on the modalities (reading, writing, listening and speaking) to plan instruction. Areas of focus 
are disseminated to the content teachers during common planning time. We collaborate with our content area teachers to 
plan instruction that meets their needs within different modalities. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

There is one class in each grade designated to include all/the majority of the ELLs in that grade. In these designated 
classes, the ELLs are in heterogeneous groups. In first, second, and third grade, the designated ELL classes are taught 
by dually certified teachers (Childhood 1-6 and TESOL). The first, second, and third grade teachers in the ELL 
designated class provided 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA to Entering and Emerging students, 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes of integrated ELA or standalone ENL to the Transitioning students, 180 integrated 
ENL/ELA or other content area to the Expanding students, and 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content 
area to the Commanding students. Kindergarten-Fifth grade standalone instruction is provided by an ENL teacher in a 
pull-out model. In addition, the ENL teachers provide 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA to Entering, Emerging, 
Transitioning, and Expanding students in Kindergarten, to the students not in the designated ELL class because of 
IEPs in grades 1-3, and to the ELL students in grade 4-8 . The integrated ENL/ELA instruction in Kindergarten and 
grades 4-8 is provided in the students' ELA classroom/period in a co-teaching model. This instruction is taught to 
heterogeneous groups. Students who scored a commanding level receive 90 minutes of additional support as 
described by the alternative pathways plan. In grades 1-5, commanding students will receive the additional services 
during the ENL integrated instruction in ELA or other content area. In grades 6-8, commanding students will receive 
the additional services during small group instruction by the ELA teachers.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 
program model by carefully planning by grade. In first, second, and third grade, the designated ELL classes are taught by dually 
certified teachers (Childhood 1-6 and TESOL). These teachers provide the 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA and 180 
standalone ENL to the Entering and Emerging students, 180 integrated ENL/ELA/standalone ENL to the Transitioning students, 
180 integrated ENL/ELA or other content area to the Expanding students, and 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other 
content area to the Commanding students. The ENL teachers provide these same services to the ELLs in Kindergarten, ELLs not 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

in the designated ELL class in grades 2-3, and ELLs in grades 4-8. All standalone ENL instruction is implemented through a pull-
out model where the students in the same grade or two contiguous grades are taught by an ENL teacher. The integrated 
ENL/ELA instruction in Kindergarten (180 minutes) is provided by the ENL teacher and classroom teacher in a co-teaching 
model. This instruction is taught to homogeneous groups. In grades 3-8, the integrated ENL/ELA instruction (90/180 minutes, 
depending on proficiency levels of students in the class) is taught to heterogeneous groups through a push-in Co-teaching 
model.       
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In our Freestanding ENL program model, the core content is delivered in English and home language support varies depending 
on the proficiency level of the students. We follow a communicative approach so that students learn to communicate in social 
settings and also in academic conversations. We integrate the content in speaking activities so that students can practice 
speaking skills while learning the content. Content is also delivered through different sources (videos, posters, audio clips, 
realia) to make it comprehensible for ELLs and to accommodate for their learning styles. ENL Teachers and classroom teachers 
work together to scaffold tasks and simplify texts for students depending on their proficiency levels. ELLs are expected to 
complete the same assignments to meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards but they are given 
accommodations such as extended time, visuals, and content specific glossaries in their home language for support. Whenever 
possible, their peers who speak the same home language offer translation of the content. This year, we are incorporating the 
work of Maryann Cucchiara in our standalone instruction to teach language through content. Through the practices outlined in 
this work, students gain background knowledge for topics they are learning in their classrooms and practice specific language 
skills based on their needs. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

If incoming students have Spanish as their home language, they are administered the Spanish LAB. Also, ELLs are offered 
informal assessments in their home language by a staff member who speaks the student's home language. We also administer 
the translated versions of the math state exam to ELL students in grades 3-8 in their home language. If the test is not available 
in a language, a translator is brought in to read the exam to the student in their home language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We do not have any SIFE students. If we were to receive a SIFE student we would utilize various resources available through 
the New York State Education Department.These resources are designed to support schools in the education of Students with 
Interrupted/Inconsistent Formal Education (SIFE). Among these resources are: a SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire and 
Guidance, the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS) assessment portal (link is external)and guidance, a Writing Screener, a 
Frequently Asked Questions document, and a SIFE Identification flow chart. The SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire is an 
instrument designed to help gather more information about potential SIFE and provides the school with an opportunity to 
learn more about the student's family and home background, educational history, and literacy practices. SIFE Writing Screener 
is used to quickly identify students’ basic writing skills as another data point to assist with the screening of potential SIFE. This 
tool can be administered to a group, and students should be given a maximum of 15 minutes to complete their writing. 
Writing Screeners are available in the following languages:  Arabic, Bengali/Bangla, Chinese-Simplified, English, Haitian-Creole, 
S’gaw Karen, Maay Maay, Spanish, and Urdu. The SIFE Screening, Identification, and Placement Flow Chart is a one page flow 
chart that outlines the steps involved in identifying Students with Interrupted/Inconsistent Formal Education, as outlined in 
Part 154 of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education. Some ways to support our SIFE students academically would be 
to create a supportive environment for these students through monthly award ceremonies that highlight their strengths, 
giving students opportunities for revision of their assignments and giving them opportunities to share their culture and 
experiences. Instruction is differentiated for Newcomers depending on their proficiency level by incorporating more of their 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

home language in directions and activities. Newcomers may receive more scaffolds and longer instruction time of standalone 
ENL depending on their level. Developing ELLs receive integrated content and ENL instruction and standalone ENL instruction. 
Teachers also plan jigsaw groups to help differentiate for the needs of these students. Newcomers and Developing ELLs are 
given formulaic expressions to help them communicate in academic settings. Long term ELLs will receive additional instruction 
tailored to their individual needs with focus on increasing literacy and increasing vocabulary. We differentiate instruction for 
former ELLs by teaching them specific skills they need to improve in small groups. They also receive various testing 
accommodations (extended time, separate location, third reading of listening selections). Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of 
ENL/ESL instruction integrated with ELA or another content area as per CR Part 154.2. All ELLs and Former ELLs (for only 2 
years) will receive extended time (time and a half) as per Part 154.2 on all state tests. Students will receive translated tests in 
their home language when available and will also be provided a translator in their home language for any city/statewide test 
(if requested). If there is no translated version of the test available for a speaker of a low incidence language, the school must 
provide an oral translator to give a direct translation. Word for word bilingual glossaries are available for ENL students to use 
for the ELA state test.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL-SWD students receive all services mandated on their IEP.  Push-in teachers work closely with classroom/content area 
teachers in order to communicate areas of need and student progress.  All service providers are given an opportunity to 
familiarize themselves with each student's IEP in order to help students meet their goals through modifications and scaffolded 
entry points. Support is provided through small group instruction that focus on specific skills and strategies needed as per the 
IEP.  Summative and formative data is also analyzed in order to help target specific skills.  Classroom/content area teachers 
work closely together to modify and scaffold academic content so that the student will accelerate English language 
development.  In addition,  teachers who service SWD collaborate together regarding academic content to accommodate 
individual student learning disabilities. ELL-SWD students have access to different programs provided schoolwide. One 
program is Castle Learning which monitors the students' progress and adjusts the program according to the performance level 
the student is functioning at. All teachers have access to their students' progress and assessments. Castle Learning contains all 
of the subject areas (i.e. Math, ELA, Social Studies, Science) and are grouped by either topic, standards, and subject. Imagine 
Learning is a computer-based program that comes in 15 languages which also targets ELL-SWD students while monitoring their 
strengths and weaknesses. For example, if a student does not master a specific skill, the skill is re-taught and reviewed by the 
student with the help of the program. In grades K-3 the online program iRead is used to help students who are at risk in 
reading and to develop their foundational skills. In addition, we use the Hochman writing method and SRSD to scaffold writing 
lessons for ELL-SWD students which includes using key words to write paragraphs and using outlines to write essays. We use 
writing pathways which includes student friendly checklists that allows students to monitor their progress in writing and create 
their next steps in collaboration with teachers. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWD students receive all services mandated on their IEP.  Push-in teachers work closely with the classroom teacher in 
order to address the individual needs reflected on the IEP.  Accomodations are made in the schedule to provide an 
environment that is conductive to learning according to the student's specific IEP goals.  Students are grouped together 
according to their academic level.   ELL-SWDs are placed in environments where the intervention received will address their 
individual academic and emotional needs.  Our school looks at different criteria to place ELL-SWDs in ICT classes.  We look at 
students' performance levels in ELA, Math, Social Studies and Science.  We also review students' IEP goals, and promotional 
criteria to determine the best classroom setting for such students where they would make the most progress.  Our teachers 
consistently monitor students' progress and ensure that the IEP goals address the students' academic and emotional 
needs.  Different instructional approaches are utilized throughout the year i.e. the Hochmann writing method, graphic 
organizers, word study (root words, sufffixes, prefixes, etc.).  In addition, different websites are used in order for SWD to 
comprehend curriculum (i.e. Padlet.com, Animoto, Thinglink ).  Furthermore, we analyze students' IEP goals and students' 
progress on the NYSESLAT to modify curriculum to address students' needs within their IEP's as well as their language 
needs.  Teachers of SWD's and ELL's have access to all curriculum maps through our One Drive community files.  Teachers

meet to collaborate regularly to add differentiated tasks and scaffolds to the curriculum to address the language needs and the 
needs expressed in students' IEP's.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ENL teachers, classroom, and content area teachers will focus on strategies that will address the needs of the ENL students 
who are struggling with the language of math, math concepts, and math skills with a focus on Entering and Emerging ELLs. 
ENL teachers will collaborate with classroom and content area teachers on the instruction of skills and strategies that show 
need of improvement.  One of the programs that we use is Fundations in grades K-2 and Wilson in grades 3-8. It helps students 
with IEPs or other at-risk students with foundational reading skills. The program scaffolds the skills in order for the students to 
master the skills. This is a program that is used to target Entering and Emerging ELLs. After school programs are offered for 
extra help and for first time ELL testers.  Scaffolding techniques and differentiated instruction will be used. We use the data 
from the EDAT tool, State ELA and Math exam results, and results from classroom assessments (such as Fountas and Pinnell 
reading levels) to determine who receives this intervention.  In addition, we also use the Rewards program, a reading 
intervention program for students in grades 6-8, to strengthen their foundational skills in reading.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In our 2018 NYS ELA exam data we noticed that the percentage of students that received a level three or four decreased since 
the previous year.  For instance, in grade 3, 35% of students received a level 3/4 which decreased by 1% from the previous 
year.  In grade 4 48% received a level 3/4 which decreased by 11%.  In grade 5 the percentage remained the same at 50%.  As a 
result, we revised our Instructional Focus for this school year to reflect upon our noticings within the data.  Our Instructional 
Focus is to use formative assessments  Use Formative Assessment Practices to improve student 
performance and  Conceptual Understanding by ensuring ample opportunities for students to engage in rich discussions, tasks 
and questions.  In addition, teachers are collaborating in grades K-5 to implement the Teacher's College Units of 
Study. Therefore, we are implementing Teacher's College Writing Pathways to accurately measure student progress in writing 
throughout grades K - 8 against the standards.  In addition, the rubrics from Writing Pathways will also be aligned to our units 
and student outcomes for each unit.  The student checklists in this program will allow students to reflect on their writing and 
monitor their progress.   We are also implementing an intervention writing program called SRSD to help our students develop 
their writing skills and to provide them with helpful strategies to focus and organize their writing.  Furthermore, we are using 
iRead, a computer based reading program, to help our students strengthen their foundational reading skills.  We are also 
utilizing another computer based program called Imagine Learning with our Entering and Emerging ELL students to 
strengthen their abilities in the English Language.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have not had a bilingual program recently. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
A Title III after school program will provide our ELLs with supplemental support in ELA and Science.  Teachers will use the 
resources and materials received from the Maryann Cucchiara professional learning sessions to develop language through 
complex texts.  In addition, there are several arts programs (i.e. Inside Broadway) which are available to all students in the 
school.  SONYC is an after school program available for grade K-8 five days a week, from dismissal to 5:00 p.m. It is a 
recreational and educational program.  Some of the activities that the students participate in are music, sports and STEM 
(science, technology, engineering, mathematics and music) related. All students are encouraged to join all after school 
opportunities regardless of their language proficiency.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Classroom teachers and ENL teachers use Fundations to support ELLs in learning to read in grades K-2. We have bilingual books 
for ELLs to take home and read with their family. Each teacher uses the SMARTboard to show visuals and support ELLS with 
total physical response. Teachers put the closed captions on when showing videos to classes with ELLs. Bilingual glossaries are 
given out to support content area vocabulary. Students are seated in groups/tables to promote speaking opportunities 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

for ELLs.   In addition, every classroom has an interactive word wall that is changed each unit to increase academic vocabulary 
across the curriculum. An intervention program such as the Wilson reading program addresses the needs of students who 
need additional support in phonics, fluency and academic vocabulary, allowing for strategies such as scaffolding and extended 
time to complete tasks.  The Leveled Literacy Intervention program is utilized to provide the needed support for ELLs in reading 
and writing skills.  Entering and Emerging students utilize Imagine Learning, an online software geared towards language 
development.  Furthermore, students struggling with decoding and fluency use iRead a computer program that offers targeted 
phonics lessons based on students needs.  Our teachers also use Reading A-Z an online resource for leveled texts.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our ENL program model, the home language is supported by providing students with bilingual dictionaries. We also 
distribute content specific glossaries to the ELLs in their home language. In the elementary school, bilingual books are sent 
home so parents can read to their children. Students are allowed to complete writing tasks in their home language when they 
are in Entering and Emerging proficiency levels. They are also encouraged to speak to their peers in their home language to 
explain content material to one another. We purchased a program called Imagine Learning, this is a computer based program 
that will accommodate many students with other languages.  The program is individualized according to the student's 
proficiency level.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All instructional materials are aligned with the Common Core Standards and teachers ensure they are appropriate for the ELLs' 
grade level. Classrooms have leveled libraries and use leveled texts for support in their instruction.  Teachers monitor students 
progress in all content areas and provide instruction and materials that students need to complete all unit tasks. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share a building.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
This year our Social Emotional focus is "to recognize how our emotions drive teaching and learning."  We will be working with 
our teacher teams to reflect on our emotional intelligence. This will aid in the support of newly enrolled ELLs through their 
transition to a new school and country. ELLs who enroll throughout the school year are urged to attend various school-wide 
events.  We have an Open School Night in September where all parents are welcome to speak and ask questions to all 
classroom/content/cluster teachers in regard to instruction and any other concerns that they may have about programs 
regarding their children. The parent coordinator hosts International Night where students from all backgrounds can share 
food, clothing, dance and music from their country. The science teachers host STEM night where students are invited with 
their parents to participate in a number of STEM activities.  In addition, there are Pre-K, K and 6  th   grade orientation 
meetings open to parents regarding all aspects of student adjustment in those transitional years. Every Tuesday, all teachers 
are available to discuss and answer questions from parents regarding their children's education.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

ELLs receive Spanish instruction in Grades 6-8.  No other language electives are available at this time.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have a dual language program currently at PS/MS 164.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
One of the professional development for classroom/content teachers is the introduction to the Language Arts Progressions (K-
8). Our ENL teachers show teachers how to use the progressions to design instruction, differentiate linguistic scaffolds that 
students require at different levels, determine specific scaffolds that target the content area demands, and plan specific 
activities to develop language skills. ENL teachers will be attending a series of professional development opportunities outside 
of our building and turnkey the information to our staff. One of those professional development opportunities is a workshop 
with Maryann Cucchiara. Some of those PDs are for academic vocabulary in content areas, nuts and bolts of ENL regulations, 
and ENL strategies for beginning teachers of ELLs . We also plan to have a PD for content area teachers and paraprofessionals 
who have Entering and Emerging students to share strategies for teaching newcomer ELLs.   In addition, professional 
development was given to all staff members, teachers and paraprofessionals, explaining the English proficiency levels, the CR 
Part 154-2 (K-8) English as a New Language (ENL) units of study, and staffing requirements.  Instruction requirements were 
explained and terminology was defined as it related to instruction i.e. stand-alone/integrated.  Throughout the year, additional 
professional development will be given to all teachers and paraprofessionals regarding the regulations as it refers to specific 
regulations i.e. LPT (Language Proficiency Team) and their role in determining eligibility for ELLs. Classroom/Content area 
teachers and paraprofessionals will explore areas such as academic vocabulary, text complexity, scaffolding strategies, RTI 
(reading intervention), and other relevant ENL topics. Furthermore, our parent coordinator is attending an ongoing cycle of 
professional development focusing on parents of ELL's and obtaining the resources and information to help them and to 
strengthen parent engagement.  Our guidance counselor has attended many workshops providing information around 
assisting ELL's as they transition.  She has attended professional development provided by the Department of Education, the 
Department of Mental Health, the Jewish Board of Family Services and other NYC agencies and universities focused on helping 
our students, including ELL's, through their various transitions.  Our speech teachers have been attending meetings provided 
by District 25 and the Supervisor of Speech Services about the speech and language deficits in the ELL population.  They have 
also been attending much of the professional development provided in our school around ENL instruction, academic 
vocabulary and the CR Part 154-2.  Our assistant principal has attended various professional development provided by the 
Queens North Field Support Center and the Education Leadership Institute around CR Part 154 and Co-Teaching for ENL 
Instruction.  Our assistant principal has then provided that information to our staff, including teachers, paraprofessionals, and 
related service providers.    
All PDs incorporate areas that are aligned with the Common Core Learning Standards such as the academic vocabulary in 
content areas PD. The Language Arts Progressions PD is directly about how to support ELLs in meeting the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  Strategies are shared with classroom/content area teachers regarding how to differentiate lessons for 
ELLs as it relates to their proficiency levels.  ENL teachers will be given the opportunity to attend professional developments 
throughout the year that are provided by Queens North Field Support Center.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school plans to have at least two PDs per month on ELL-specific areas. One of the ENL teachers is part of the Professional 
Development Committee to ensure that various ELL-specifc areas are covered. Additionally, ENL teachers are sent to PDs 
once/twice a month to complete the 50% of total hours requirement. A record of all attendees are taken at each PD with an 
attendance sheet. Agendas for each PD are handed out to all in attendance. Our ENL teachers facilitate professional learning 
sessions throughout the year focusing on building academic vocabulary, and strengthening listening, reading and writing skills 
.  Within these sessions our ENL teachers share strategies and tools that can be used to scaffold instruction for our ELL

students in different content areas.  Furthermore, our ENL teachers also collaborate with content area teachers throughout 
the week to look at student work and create next steps for students that will strengthen their skills in all the modalities. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school holds annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs in the beginning of the year and on meet the teacher night to 
discuss goals for each student. Another meeting is scheduled in the middle of the year to discuss language development 
progress. Parents are also encouraged to meet with ENL teachers after they speak to their child's teacher to discuss next steps 
in their language development needs in content areas. Parents can also make appointments to speak to ENL teachers any 
Tuesday afternoon. During all meetings, parents are offered a translator (staff member or hired) and all documents they 
receive are in their preferred language or home language. Furthermore, we offer adult ESL classes two times a week to help 
our parents learn the English Language.  Our Parent Coordinator attended the ELL Specific Overview workshop that provided 
her with information on how to better communicate and serve our families of ELL students.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

During the ELL orientation meeting in the beginning of the year parents are informed of the various ways they can be more 
involved. For every PTA sponsored event, a notification is sent home in different languages asking for volunteers. Once a year 
we hold an International Night where parents of ELLs are invited to share their culture by volunteering or simply attending the 
event. 
Workshops are conducted by the Parent-Coordinator to various groups of parents informing them of programs available in our 
school.  The needs of the parents are evaluated through surveys, and during meetings, by the parent coordinator. The parent 
coordinator workshops focus on informing parents on pertinent school issues concerning their children such as standardized 
testing, homework strategies, the citywide discipline code and ELL programs. Both written and oral translation services are 
available. PTA also assists with translating to parents. Furthermore, we provide adult ESL classes twice a week to our 
parents.  Our Title III program provides a shared learning experience for parents and students where parents are invited to 
engage with students through literacy and science.   
In the beginning of the year, our Parent Coordinator provides a parent communication survey where parents express their 
preference for communication with the school.  Our Parent Coordinator also provides the parents with the Title I survey to 
express their interests in parent workshops and activities for the school year.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lisa Liatto, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and 
oral communication is the Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) complied from the Home Lnaguage 
Identification Survey (HLIS). This information is gathered during the registration process where parents/guardians 
are asked for their preferred language for written and oral communication. In addition, we generate the RPOB 
ATS report which indicated the language that is spoken at home. Finally, parents/guardians also indicate their 
preferred language for oral and written communication on the student emergency contact card.

A copy of Section III of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 regarding the obligation of the school and central office to 
provide language assistance services and where the notice can be obtained will be made available to parents in a 
covered language. The safety plan will include procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language assistance 
services are not prevented from reaching the school's administrative offices. A copy of Chancellor's Regulations A-663 
regarding translations and interpretations as well as the website needed to obtain this particular regulation as well as 
the other Chancellor's Regulations will be made available to parents in a covered language. In-house staff will be used 
for written translation and oral interpretations. Parents/staff will be used for oral interpretation during conferences 
and meetings. The Department of Education will provide an interpreter in American Sign Language. Primary language 
spoken will be determined by survey in September. Translated versions of the "Parent's Bill of Rights" are on file in the 
main office and parent coordinator's office as well as posted in the main entrance. Signage indicating the availability 
of interpretation services is posted in the major languages provided by the Department of Education. Additional signs 
that are posted in the lobby are also posted in the major languages provided by the Department of Education. A staff 
member has been assigned to coordinate translation and interpretation services for the school. The NYC Achieve - A

A survey will be sent home 2 times (Fall and Spring) a year to monitor the quality and availability of services to all 
parents/guardians who require translation and/or interpretation. We will gather the feedback on best practices in 
communicating with families through our survey and concentrate on a focus group that represents the various 
cultures and languages in our school.
