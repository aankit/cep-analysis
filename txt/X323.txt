Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify 

the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content 
standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

At the Bronx Writing Academy, we believe that education is the civil rights movement of our time. We believe that 
schools are the vehicles for transformation in communities, cities, the country and the world. At the Bronx Writing 
Academy, we believe that schools can shape communities.  

We strive to fulfill our school mission of transforming the students within our school as well as the citizens of the 
community we serve. The Bronx Writing Academy’s school mission is to develop a community of outstanding citizens, 
learners, and writers who celebrate and respect every one’s culture and voice. We strive to work hard, together, in a 
safe haven. We embrace innovation, ask challenging questions, and think critically. We work to achieve extraordinary 
things for our school, our community, and our world by making conscientious and informed decisions.

To build out strong family community ties, we continue to be a UFT Community Learning School. Through UFT 
Community Learning Schools we are able to secure partnerships with outside organizations that our students, parents 
and community members need. Through surveys we are able to intensively address the most pressing needs of our 
community. This has meant deepening our parental engagement past assemblies to GED classes, ESL classes, and 
more; focusing in on anti-gang initiatives; and providing our students with the socio-emotional counseling they need 
in order to cope with traumas and have the strength to complete academic work. We will continue to transform our 
community, providing our students and their families with the education and services they desperately need and 
deserve. 

 

Over the past year, we have worked hard to build on our structures for supportive environment and collaborative 
teachers.  Collaborative teachers are an important component in building great schools. We have a committed, 
collaborative staff willing to do whatever it takes to help our community. We have built out our core staff model to 
the highest degree and we are heavily invested in human capital. In order to foster collaboration, we have created a 
schedule that allows our teachers work in teams called pods of four core teachers who all teach the same students in 
only three sections. They meet together two times per week to discuss student academic performance, analyze 
socio-emotional needs of their shared students, and meet with students’ parents as a cohesive body. In addition to to 
pod meetings, our teachers also meet in departments an additional two times a week to develop instructional 
practice. We have one Peer Collaborative Teacher (PCTs) and three Model Teachers funded by Bronx Writing 
Academy. 

We encourage the majority of our students stay in school until 5:40pm; this extended school-day is made possible 
through our collaboration with LeAp. This partnership allows for extended learning through a curriculum provided by 
LeAp that aligns to the Common Core Standards in addition to an opportunity for students to participate in arts clubs 
and sports. Additionally, we will host a variety of after school clubs with BWA staff members. Some of them include 
Robotics, Invention Project, Regents Math practice, and ELA/Math intervention. All of these clubs are arranged by 
student need. We are also a Community Learning School, Learning Partners Plus school and a PROSE school. Being a 
Community Learning School has allowed us to develop a framework around which to truly transform the lives of the 
families we serve by organizing our efforts around our students’ emotional and physical needs, not just their 
academic needs. 

In an effort to create strong teacher retention, we have structures in place to help create a strong pipeline to induct 
new teachers. Through the New York Teaching Collaborative initiative, we have six Collaborative Coaches and five 
Partner Teachers in Residence who will be available to be hired for any vacancies in our school in Fall 2014. We have 
already staffed our school with three former partner teachers in residence. This program has helped create stable 
teaching staff. In our peer schools, principals stay an average of three years and teacher turnover rates are high. We 
have stable school leadership and low turnover in our teaching staff. This committed, collaborative staff has worked 
together to create a common academic language at our school and a culture of reflection, inter-visitation, and hard 
work. 

 

At Bronx Writing Academy, we create a supportive environment not with just our teachers and staff but with 
partnerships with outside organizations.  

Three years ago we received a federal SEIG grant through NYSED. This grant has given us the opportunity to partner 
with organizations such as Connect with Kids who help develop our student's social-emotional skills through 
documentary writing and film making and Teaching Matters who has helped to deepen teacher practice in student 
discussion and shared inquiry aligned to Danielson. Additionally, we are partnered with Camp Invention and Lego 
Robotics to help our students become 21st century learners and doers by exposing them to real-world experiences. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

This fall we will be offering these elective courses to students in an attempt to prepare them to be competitive in 
STEAM education. 

This year we will continue to partner with LeAp after school LeAp (Learning through the expanded arts program) will 
also work alongside of BWA to deepen our student's capacity in the arts and social emotional learning through the 
help and guidance of their teaching artists.  

In addition, fifty percent of our teachers will be trained in the Cornell Therapeutic Crisis Intervention System (TCIS) 
and 100 percent trained in Restorative Practices to help our teachers address the socio-emotional needs of our 
students. These methods provide a crisis prevention and intervention model that helps adults prevent, de-escalate, 
and manage crises and learn constructive ways to handle stressful or traumatic situations. With 100 percent of our 
staff trained in the method, we will be on our way to developing a common language and community of thought 
around our students’ socio-emotional needs, just as we have around their academic needs. 

 

 

 

 

 
3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

 

Our community faces overwhelming challenges. Forty-two percent of our students are considered chronically absent. 
Twenty percent of our students live in transitional housing, a statistic that has grown by 300 percent over the past five 
years. Seventeen percent of our students are over-age. Thirty percent of our students are English Language Learners 
and many newcomers to the country. Twenty percent of our students are students with disabilities. Only 37 percent 
of the students in our local high schools graduate in four years, and fewer than ten percent are prepared for college. 
These are conditions that affect not only our students but also our entire community. Reaching out to our families in 
an organized, intensive way is the only way we can have a hope at transforming our community and giving our 
students the opportunities they deserve. Becoming a Community Learning School has allowed us to organize our 
efforts to reach the entire Morrisania community and meet its pressing needs. 

 
4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the 

past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The DTSDE Tenet(s) in which your school made the most growth during the previous year and the key areas of focus 
for this school year: 

Growth Area 1: Supportive Environment 

Growth Area 2: Collaborative Teachers 

 

Area of Focus for 2018-2019 School Year: Rigorous Instruction 

 

As we go into the 2018-2019 school year, Rigorous instruction (1.2 on the Quality Review) continues to be our area of 
focus. We will be working specifically to develop cohesive practices across classrooms around rigorous instruction and 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

critical thinking. We will do this through the implementation of a new curricula in ELA and math in addition to the 
implementation of Thinking Maps across all classrooms. Our instructional focus is as follows: If teachers engage in 
learning cycles focused on planning rigorous lessons through the use of Thinking Maps, then students will become 
autonomous learners and intellectually engage with content at high levels.The two weekly department team 
meetings along with Monday Professional Learning will allow us the opportunity to plan rigorous units that 
incorporate Thinking Maps, analyze student work, refine current practices, provide feedback on colleague 
classroom instruction and reflect on successes and next steps. Through the practice of cycles of problem of practice, 
teachers will be able to improve their instructional practices.  

 

School Strengths, Accomplishments, and Challenges:  

 

Despite the challenges facing our school community, the Bronx Writing Academy team works innovatively and 
tirelessly to meet the children’s needs. On our School Snapshot we achieved "Good" standings as it relates to the 
Framework for Great Schools. In our 2016-2017 Quality Review, we received proficient in 1.1, 2.2, 1.4, 3.4, 3.1, 4.1, 
4.2, 5.1.all 6 areas of the Quality Review 1.1, 2.2 and Well-developed in areas 1.3.  

 

 

5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the 

instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards; 
provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year. 

Modify the instructional program to ensure it is evidenced based and rigorous and aligned to state academic content

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

Strengths: PBIS implementation leading to extraordinary drop in suspension rates; two guidance counselors to staff; 
numerous CBO alliances contributing to student socio-emotional growth and development 

This year, full implementation of the internationally recognized PBIS program as well as extensive teacher training in 
Therapeutic Crisis Intervention for Schools (TCIS) has supported student socio-emotional growth and health. In the 
spring we began training our staff in Restorative Practices. Our school culture is now defined by a standard set of 
behavioral expectations for both staff and students, which has led to greater consistency in discipline measures as well 
as the support of socio-emotional health of students by administrators, teachers, guidance counselors, our mediation 
center, and more service providers. As we continue into the 2018-2019 school year, we will build on those expectations 
and practices so that our neediest populations get as many services as possible.  

 

The service systems and structures we have implemented are as follows:

1. The addition of two new guidance counselors to our staff has led to improved access  

to mental health services for all students. 

2. Astor Services for Children & Families : Beginning in Fall 2014, Astor Services for Children & Families has a school-
based mental health clinic at our school. The clinic provides on-site psychotherapy for our students, as well as 
assessment and treatment planning; a combination of family, individual, and group therapy; psychiatric evaluations; 
medicine management; and psycho-education for parents. Many of our students have experienced trauma, and the 
school-based mental health clinic will provide these students the support they need in order to improve their socio-
emotional and physical development. 

4. Therapeutic Crisis Intervention System (TCIS) : At least 75% percent of our teachers will be trained in the Cornell 
TCIS. This method provides a crisis prevention and intervention model that helps adults prevent, de-escalate, and 
manage crises and learn constructive ways to handle stressful or traumatic situations. With a majority of our staff 
trained in the method, we will be on our way to developing a common language and community of thought around our 
students’ socio-emotional needs, just as we have around their academic needs. 

5. RESTORATIVE PRACTICES: Training staff in Restorative Practices through Morningside and our Restorative Practice 
Coordinator. Additional support of counselors from partnerships such as RAPP and CLS.  

 

Needs:  

Continue to decrease level 4 and 5 incidents through an behavior implementation team with a focus on our students 
with disabilities.  

A continued area of improvement at Bronx Writing Academy is attendance. Student attendance rates last year were 
89%. While this was an increase from the previous year, it continues to be a focus with the goal of getting it to raise 2 
percentage points.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified

Strengths: According to our 2016-2017 Quality Review we are proficient 4.2. Coherent teacher teams meet five times 
per week, horizontally and vertically; we offer extensive teacher leadership opportunities and have both model teachers 
and peer collaborative teachers on staff. Our staff participates in teacher rounds to observe and share best practices 
around a problem of practice and uses Mastery Connect to track and analyze data in both content and grade teams. . 

Needs: School-wide use of Mastery Connect to track and analyze data through the use of cohesive systems and 
structures to assess and evaluate student achievement; coherent school-wide student work analysis protocols.  

Teacher leaders have effectively created a culture of urgency, data analysis, and student engagement. This culture has 
been made possible by the clear, school-wide structures around common planning, looking at student work, planning 
instructional implications and collaborating for success. There has been a focus on student engagement and sharing best 
practices through the structure of teacher rounds.  

Teacher inquiry teams (both vertical and horizontal) will identify problems of practice after data is collected by Mastery 
Connect. They will specifically analyze data for all subgroups including SWDs and create a targeted plan to meet the 
needs of those students. Teachers will identify focus standards, analyze how these standards were taught and assessed 
and plan for instruction in groups. From that point teachers will learn from each other through teacher rounds and 
reflect on the planning and implementation. This cycle of learning through problems of practice will allow teachers to 
share best practices and reflect on what's working and not in the classroom.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          26 

 

Pod and grade teams will work to create Response to Intervention groups based on student need according to a variety 
of screeners. Teachers will use the Problem of Practice protocol to guide their conversations around success in these RtI 
groups. This emphasis on data has clearly led to deep personalization of learning for students; it has also led to 
increased student achievement.

Summary of Bronx Writing Academy strengths and needs (School Leader Practices and Decisions):  

Strengths: Coherent teacher team groupings; extensive teacher leadership opportunities 

Needs: Implementation of consistent, coherent instructional practices across classrooms. 

To date, our school community has collaborated by creating a team structure called Pods. Core teachers are grouped in 
teams of four, with each team consisting of one Math, one ELA, one Social Studies, and one Science teacher. This team, 
or Pod, teaches three sections of students (~80 students). This enables teachers to easily collaborate around instruction 
and behavior intervention, as well as parent contact. These teachers meet during three 46-minute periods per week; 
during these meetings, the Pod teachers focus on school-wide focus areas and share consistent evidence of 
personalization. Routines and practices are within each class, and Pod members engage in monthly inter-Pod visitations 
with feedback, reflections, and evidence of inter-visitation impact across content areas. Pod teachers also reflect on

system has helped push our progress and has led us to be ranked in the 90th percentile of all middle schools, having 
been in the 17th percentile in 2011 (before we introduced the Pod structure).  

This structure has also allowed for twice-weekly department meetings of 45 minutes each. These department meetings 
are led by teacher leaders. Teachers analyze data and share Danielson-based feedback aligned to our school's 
instructional focus and problem of practice. We have held SBO votes in which all teachers chose common planning time 
as their Circular 6 option. This has enabled teachers to meet three times per week in their Pods; additionally, this SBO 
vote has enabled teachers to meet with their department teams twice per week. During these meetings, teachers 
analyze data, share evidence of data-based personalization, and share Danielson-based feedback from inter-visitations. 

 

Teacher teams plan collaboratively two times per week. During these meetings, teachers analyze student academic and 
behavioral data and come up with interventions accordingly.  

 

In 2014-2015, we also became a Community Learning School and a PROSE school. Becoming a Community Learning 
School has provided us with a framework around which to truly transform the lives of the families we serve by 
organizing our efforts around our students’ emotional and physical needs, not just their academic needs—and by 
focusing on the engagement of our parents, not just our students. As a PROSE school, we have focused on student 
engagement as well as the engagement of our teachers in teacher rounds. This year we will continue to focus 
specifically on shared decision making as a school. Our development of strong teacher teams and teacher leaders who 
uphold the collaborative structures in our school.  

The leader has put these structures in place and will continue to monitor their success through the use of learning walks 
and protocols. This year there will be a focus on our students with disabilities to ensure we are meeting their needs and 
progressing both behaviorally and academically. All of these programs continue to support our vision of building a 
collaborative environment with student achievement at the center. This year we will continue to build out our 
instructional core with a focus on building teacher capacity. We will achieve this end by implementing an intervisitation 
practice. This will increase the level of instruction in the building and hold all members accountable for providing 
Danielson aligned feedback.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

22% of 
students 
are in 
temporary 
housing 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

Because of the high percentage of students who are in temporary housing, we have been assigned by the DOE a 
liaison to help us support this population. We will provide after school services for these students through LeAp and 
academic intervention. Our school will have an emergency fund to use for students in temporary housing. This fund 
will be used to provide uniforms, supplies, and books for students in temporary housing. Glasses will be provided free 
of charger through Hellen Keller. Additionally, our in school clinic will provide physicals and immunizations for those 
who need. Our partnership with Astor will allow us to provide mental health services for students in need. We have 
secured funding to bring in a Restorative Justice Coordinator and additional social workers through Counseling in 
Schools. Finally, all staff members will be trained in Therapeutic Crisis Intervention to be able to support any student 
in crisis.  

 

Part B: FOR NON-TITLE I SCHOOLS

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The Bronx Writing Academy works very hard to create teacher teams that collaboratively work together to write 
curricula and assessments, monitor and track student progress through data analyses, provide individualized 
learning and advisories, and to build school-wide structures and protocols that build a strong community. 
Therefore we have established the following practices:  

Recruitment & Assignments:  

1. Clear, specific, licensing requirements, roles and responsibilities for opening positions are posted 

2. A Hiring Committee comprised of teachers, administrators, parents and staff is created. 

3. Using a specific rubric , the committee reviews résumés to analyze qualifications and determine candidates who 
will move on to a group interview. 

4. Group Interview: 4-6 Candidates selected are seen at the same time and asked to work as a team to problem-solve 
and issue around student progress, data analyses, collaboration and/or classroom management. 

5. The Committee again uses the rubric to narrow the list of candidates for one on one interviews . 

6. The rubrics are consulted again and a discussion about results and recommendations ensues. 

7. We invite the finalists to teach a demonstration Lesson.  

8. An offer is made to the top candidate. If it is accepted letters of apologies are sent to the remaining candidates 

 

Retention and Support:

- New teachers are paired with a mentor in their own subject area 

- Weekly visits, planning and discussions around excellent practices occur 

- Mentors make suggestions about other resources available, including colleagues and Professional Development 

- Bi-weekly Department meetings are built into teacher schedules and held to support all teachers about our common 
vision and expectations for instruction. 

- Teacher team meetings (pods) are built into teacher schedules and held 3X per week to promote shared structures 
and protocols for working with a shared group of students. 

- Teachers identify students who may be struggling academically, socially or emotionally. They formulate personalized 
plans and the support each other in monitoring the students’ progress. 

- Plans are adjusted as needed 

 

Collaborative Coaches and Model Teachers support teachers by:  

- Visiting classes and providing specific, targeted feedback. 

- Co-planning lessons 

- Co-teaching 

- Modeling 

- Providing resources to help with teacher development 

- providing Professional Development in all areas of Instruction, including, but not limited to, Domains 2 and 3 of the

School-wide use of teacher created benchmark assessments that are aligned to state tests and MoSL assessments 
ensures that teachers are engaged in use of appropriate assessments throughout the year. Each year teams come 
together to revise internal assessments and determine the best tools necessary for assessing and gathering data on 
students. All departments have been trained in the use of Mastery Connect, a platform for uploading and analyzing

assessment data. Teacher teams work collaboratively to engage in data analysis and discussion of data and re-teach 
strategies in an ongoing data analysis cycle, using a department-wide data analysis protocol. All students are also 
assessed on the iReady and the WADE and WIST assessment. This data is analyzed by the Instructional Leadership 
Team and used in teacher team (pod) meetings to adjust instruction pod by pod. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 09X323, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

The Bronx Writing Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional

  ELL   students at the Bronx Writing Academy need additional time on task beyond the regular 
school day. There is a constant flow of newcomers as well as students with interrupted and 
inconsistent formal education (SIFE). 
  
Students will receive ENL instructional after school for one and a half hours, two days a week. 
The sessions will focus on language acquisition through building basic vocabulary skills through 
a program by Robert Marzano that works to build Tier 1 Vocabulary. Additionally they will 
spend two days of the week focusing on math skills. All classes will be taught in English, with 
scaffolds provided in Spanish. We will be using both Language Power, Rosetta Stone, and iready 
as programs to support the instruction. Rosetta Stone will also be used with students during an 
intervention period. Reading Plus will be used as an independent reading tool in English 
Language Arts. And Language Power will be implemented during ENL instruction. Student 
attendance and record will be maintained and monitored by the teachers delivering the 
instructions. Students will be grouped based on NYSESLAT scores and their ELL proficiency 
levels. Classes will have a 1:30 ratio of teacher to student.   
  
In Math during the day, students will focus on developing analytic mathematical skills. The 
program will focus on developing students' skills around analyzing, creating, and solving 
mathematical word problems. Teachers will focus on mathematical vocabulary and word 
problem creation using evidence in logical arguments. Students will also engage in discussions 
and use of evidence in word problems. This will build speaking, listening, writing, and reading 
skills and will be reinforced after school. 
  
In ELA, students will focus on speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills by reading and 
discussing books on their reading levels, as well as through analysis of passages and activities in 
the Language Power and NYCDOE SIFE curricula. 
  
 
The duration of the program will be March through May . We have planned 14 weeks for the 
program ( two per week, for one hour and a half per session). The cost will be: 28 session x 1.5 
hours x 55.23 x 4 teachers = $9,278.64. The remaining funds will be spent in the following 
manner: PD = $1, 610 used for PD to unpack the programs being implemented; $3,215 used to 
purchase supplies for the program (Language Power books); $1607 used for Parent education 
about how to support ELLs at home.  
  
This program program will serve 90 students. Students will be grouped by grade level and 
English ability, with more recent immigrants grouped separately from students who have been in 
the country for a longer period of time. 
  
Two of the participating teachers are certified in bilingual educaton. These two teachers will 
work with the beginning Spanish-speaking ELLs to raise their language proficiency, as identified

by theirs NYSESLAT scores. This will include SIFE. Two teachers are certified in ESL 
instruction. One is a certified Math teacher, and one is a certified ELA teacher. These groupings 
will be determined by NYSESLAT scores. Intermediate NYSESLAT scores and above 1.5 
proficiency rating will cause students to be designated to ESL teachers. Advanced students with 
above 1.5 proficiency ratings will be designated to the ELA teacher. The Math teacher is also 
certified in bilingual education, and he will work with the lowest-performing students (below 1.5 
proficiency).

Begin description here:            
   Many teachers of   ELLs   at the Bronx Writing Academy use The Sheltered Instruction 
Observation Protocol (SIOP) Model. It is a research-based and validated instructional model that 
has been proven effective in addressing the academic needs of immigrants throughout the United 
States. Teachers of ELLs will meet bi-weekly from October - May to align instruction. Those 
who are trained in the SIOP model and our ELL Liaison will lead the professional learning. This 
program is at no cost to the program as these meetings will occur during our school day on 
Tuesday afternoon. 
  
The SIOP Model consists of eight interrelated components:  
  
•         Lesson Preparation: Teachers are taught planning strategies for specifically engaging 
immigrant students.  
  
•         Building Background:  Teachers' background knowledge of immigrant instruction is 
broadened. 
  
•         Strategies:  Teachers are introduced to specific in-class strategies that target immigrant 
students. 
  
•         Practice/Application:  Teachers are given opportunities to practice and apply their 
knowledge in the classroom and engage in follow up work with a staff developer. 
  
•         Lesson Delivery:  Teachers learn implementation techniques that dramatically increase the 
effectiveness of lesson delivery, which directly impacts students. 
  
•         Review/Assessment: Teachers meet as a department to review and assess the work done 
and their progress in each area.  
  
Teachers will meet and revise unit plans and lesson plans across all grades.  This will ensure that 
ELL students have effective language and content objectives in every lesson.  They will also use 
this time to analyze student data and student work in an effort to identify the trends across the

Part C: Professional Development  
school.  This will lead to more targeted instruction for our immigrant students. Additionally, we 
have partnered with the DOE for Short Cycle Evaluations of computer based ELL programs.  
  
Teachers will also meet as a professional learning community to receive specific learning in how 
to teach students immigrating to America at varying levels of ability. Our school-wide 
professional development plan includes strategies in how to get our students to use language in 
discussion; teaching our students academic vocabulary; cognitive engagement through multiple 
points of entry; flexible grouping; tiered lessons; and more. This PD will occur on Tuesday 
afternoons, beginning in February and continuing until May, with a ELL coach from Teaching 
Matters who will be responsible for all sign-in sheets and agendas that she will submit to staff. 
This is at no cost to the program.  
  
PD will continue to be provided to teachers teaching in the Title III program, focused on contents 
implemented in this program. Specifically, teachers will receive PD and common planning time 
around the SIFE curriculum, as well as PD on SIOP strategies. 
  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact

Begin description here:            
  
  
As a Community Learning School, we have sent out parent surveys to assess our community's 
needs. In analyzing the data provided by these surveys, we have found that parents would like 
support and guidance around the following: citizenship, English as a new language, computer 
literacy, and job/resume building. Our school focuses heavily on blended learning through the 
use of computers and website platforms for instruction. We will use our special parent 
conferences as well as other parent engagement meetings to ensure that our parents have the 
skills they need to help their children, as well as the skills they need to succeed at their own 
goals. 
 
   
  
A representative from FACE provides weekly Saturday ESL classes for parents of our students 
and members of the community at no cost to Title III. ESL and bilingual Teachers will provide 
the parent workshops on various evenings to educate parents on how to support our ELLs twice a 
month. Our resource coordinator and parent coordinator will be involved with the Parent 
Engagement component of the plan, which will involve information specifically for immigrant 
parents. Though the focus of these additional parent conferences will be helping our immigrant 
parents to help their children in school and test preparation, our parent coordinator will also 
provide information and resources specifically for the parents themselves. Our parent coordinator 
will maintain all records of participation in all events and language preferred.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 
BWA uses formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments used to guide instructional planning include: 
NYSESLAT exam data is used to ensure homeroom assignment for ELLs. Data is shared with content teachers to facilitate 
instructional grouping and conversation in pods (homeroom teams.)  It is also used to flag students who have not made 
progress/growth from previous years to target during RTI instruction.  (For example five 8th grade students have not moved 
up in proficiency. They have been highlighted to their content teachers and will be grouped during RTI to review strategies to 
support vocabulary building and literacy. Four students also identified in the 7th grade will get similar type of 
support.)  Students meet with ENL teachers to discuss their proficiency and breakdown of modalities to craft overall goals for 
the school year. 
TELL (Test of English Language Learning) by Pearson will be used throughout the school year as a baseline language 
assessment and continuous progress monitoring for entering, emerging, and transitioning students. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

iReady Reading and Math diagnostic data (September 2017) is used to create RTI groups.  Entering and emerging students will 
receive direct ENL instruction during this time. Students will receive direct instruction with the Math teacher on a rotating 
basis based on this diagnostic data as well as classroom formative assessments. 
Formative assessments used during instruction are tied to specific content standards or domains. Teachers use “Looking at 
Student Work” protocol in department meetings to identify misunderstandings and plan strategies and scaffolds for 
reteaching. 
Interim assessments are created in content teams and modified based on the population served (ENL, ICT, etc.)  Assessments 
are given on 4-6 week intervals and are reviewed in department teams and with students to determine areas of additional 
support.   
Department teams identified specific “problems of practice” based on collaborative review of student formative and 
summative assessments and used the “Teacher Round” protocol to share and build practice and strategies around supporting 
ENL students and ICT students (all teachers in our school teach either one or both of these subgroups.) 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Grade and content teams meet weekly to analyze student data and discuss trends, and action plan next steps. These common 
planning meetings are built into the schedules of all teachers.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need: 
ELL baseline is given at the beginning of each year. Prior year and the baseline determined student classes and instructional 
small groups. 
Each marking period, students and parents receive progress reports detailing performance task,  interim exams, and classroom 
assessment data.  These summative assessments are modified for language and content. 
Teachers track progress for formative and summative assessments against identified standards and domains using  Mastery 
Connect. Mastery Connect is used to log specific formative assessments, interim assessments, certain performance task 
criterion and others based on agreements within department teams.      
Students will complete the Fall and Spring English Language Learner Benchmark Assessment. 
Students who receive Native Language Arts will take the Home Language Arts (HLA) in Spanish when available. 
Students who may be SIFE are given the NYSED Multilingual Screener 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Structures in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered: 
The RTI period schoolwide is where key findings from summative data review is revisited for additional instruction since 
students are placed in small groups and support is given by all teachers.  Student groups are modified if needed based on the 
specific goals identified by the ELA or Math department teams.  Decisions are also specific to each pod based on the needs of 
the specific students identified. Specific domains in iReady for Reading and Math are identified for additional instructional 
practice and assessment for each student based on their performance on the assessment and on the recommendation of their 
content teacher. 
The Pod meetings structure is where summative data is gathered and analyzed.  Teams are able to determine specific 
standards that need additional focus and plan for changes to RTI groups;  create interdisciplinary scaffolds to support the 
students; conference with students on specific areas of concern and/or create additional support time such as lunch study 
hall/ peer tutoring. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
ENL students will be engaged in same grade-level curriculum as their English dominant peers with scaffolds provided in terms 
of pacing/instructional strategies/ language acquisition based on their English proficiency levels. 
Students who score at “Entering” or “Emerging” will receive stand-alone English language instruction during the RTI block (1st

language;  understanding of functional language, as well as the forms of English used in a variety of social and academic 
situations.  Students will engage in instructional practices to strengthen their reception (listening and reading) and production 
(speaking and writing) of standard English.   
Students will also have the opportunity in these homogeneous groups to voice questions, concerns, and opinions about their 
experiences in learning a new language as well as being in a new school, city, and country. 
Students who score at “Entering,” “Emerging,” “Transitioning,” and “Expanding” will be heterogeneously grouped in 
classrooms.  ENL teachers will push-in to co-teach during the ELA period to support language acquisition. 
“Commanding” proficiency students will be in the ‘04” homerooms and receive support through instructional strategies and 
scaffolds by their content teachers.  Any concern about specific students will be presented to the ENL teacher who co-teaches 
with the ELA teacher in that team. 
Students identified as SIFE and who are Spanish-speaking will be pulled-out during RTI to receive support in literacy and Math 
with the Native Language Arts teacher. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
ENL teachers create and update a spreadsheet called “ENL Data Profile 2017-2018” and share it with all teachers and support 
staff who work with the ENL students. That spreadsheet is a compilation of ATS reports as well as anecdotal data based on 
student IEP modifications, findings from iReady diagnostic, and anecdotal information family, medical, academic highlights, 
behavior and attendance concerns, student interests, etc  based on conferences with students, parents, and other 
teachers/staff. This tool was created to look holistically at student data not only standardized test scores (NYSESLAT, Math, 
and ELA.) 
 
Math and ELA department teams are also specifically analyzing exam data to determine instructional supports necessary 
around key standards. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

All teachers share data, instructional resources and assessments through the Google platform set up under the school’s 
domain.  Periodic meetings during the Tuesday pd time are also set up for all teachers who support ENL students to meet to 
share best practices, look at student data, and coplan with their department pairs. ENL teachers will share data from the EDAT 
in order to modify instructional programs for ELLs. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ENL students will be engaged in same grade-level curriculum as their English dominant peers with scaffolds provided 
in terms of pacing/instructional strategies/ language acquisition based on their English proficiency levels. 
Students who score at “Entering” or “Emerging” will receive stand-alone English language instruction during the RTI 
block (1st period of the day.)   
English instruction during the “stand-alone” period will involve building the students’ basic vocabulary and general 
academic language;  understanding of functional language, as well as the forms of English used in a variety of social 
and academic situations.  Students will engage in instructional practices to strengthen their reception (listening and 
reading) and production (speaking and writing) of standard English.   
Students will also have the opportunity in these homogeneous groups to voice questions, concerns, and opinions 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

about their experiences in learning a new language as well as being in a new school, city, and country. 
Students who score at “Entering,” “Emerging,” “Transitioning,” and “Expanding” will be heterogeneously grouped in 
classrooms.  ENL teachers will push-in to co-teach during the ELA period to support language acquisition. 
“Commanding” proficiency students will be in the ‘04” homerooms and receive support through instructional 
strategies and scaffolds by their content teachers.  Any concern about specific students will be presented to the ENL 
teacher who co-teaches with the ELA teacher in that team. 
 
The integrated model is being implemented by pairing an ENL teacher with the ELA teacher in each grade.  Teachers 
engage in a variety of co-teaching models based on both the objective of the lesson and/or the specific needs of the 
students against those goals. ENL students are heterogeneously grouped within each of the two ENL homerooms per 
grade.  Grouping within the classroom is also dependent on the objective for the day. ENL teachers are programmed 
to attend the pod meetings for the respective grades they support as well as the weekly ELA department meetings. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Block programming ensures that mandated service time is met.  
Students identified as SIFE and who are Spanish-speaking will be pulled-out during RTI to receive support in literacy and Math 
with the Native Language Arts teacher. 
 
Mandated service time is delivered to students as follows: 
Entering and Emerging students receive 180 minutes stand-alone ESL during the daily RTI block.  They also get 300 minutes of 
integrated support during ELA with the Transitioning and Expanding students.   Spanish-speaking Entering, Emerging, and 
Transitioning students receive 180 minutes of NLA weekly.  SIFE students receive additional support from the NLA 
teacher.   Students in self-contained and ICT settings are placed based on their IEPs and are serviced as needed at the 
prompting of the SETTs and IEP teachers. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Students will engage with instructional materials that are age and instructionally appropriate and of quality comparable to 
those provided to their peers while still building their content and/or language knowledge. 
Content teachers in Math, Science, and Social Studies will incorporate language objectives and instructional strategies and 
scaffolds to support language development in their instruction.  Students will be assessed for content in their content classes 
and for language using progress monitoring. 
Students native language will be a resource to support students as they grow academically  using native language content 
glossaries and content reading; technological based support tools (i.e. Google Translate; content specific web sources; etc.) as 
well as peers to support building their content and academic skills.  Students will be encouraged to continue to develop their 
native language literacy by the incorporation of a native language library that students can access to borrow books for 
additional independent reading. 
Spanish-speaking students in the “Entering,” “Emerging,”  and “Transitioning,” proficiency levels will receive native language 
literacy support by the Native Language Arts teacher.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  Progress monitoring for language development will occur as a year-long process.  Initial assessment will be based on a 
baseline assessment.  Fall and Spring benchmark assessments will be given using the Pearson periodic assessment available 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

through the DOE. Additionally, The Bronx Writing Academy (BWA) administers formative assessments to all students in 6-week 
cycles.  The assessments are created in home languages where applicable. We order the appropriate number of state tests for 
the languages represented in the school.  We reach out to the office of translation where necessary for languages not covered. 
NLA teachers also frequently assess their students on skills related to those students are studying in ELA classes, to ensure that 
students are staying on track with the skills for which they are cognitively, but not linguistically, ready. Assessing students' 
comfort with these skills in their native languages ensures that they are appropriately evaluated in their native languages even 
more frequently.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
All Spanish-speaking ELLs who are in the entering, emerging, and transitioning proficiency levels get Spanish NLA four times a 
week.  From within these students, any identified as SIFE, get additional support from the NLA teacher (7th graders are pulled 
every day during the RTI block and 8th graders are pulled out during some Social Studies periods and are building literacy 
through Spanish-language Social Studies content). 
 
Newcomer ELLs are part of the stand-alone ENL period during the morning RTI block.  They are also part of the “Morning 
Meeting” group with Entering and Emerging ELLs to create an environment where they are able to share experiences of 
recently arriving to our school and/or city; the struggles of learning English; and learn ways of growing in social/emotional 
dialogue, interactions, and reflections. 
 
Developing ELLs have been identified to their respective pods to celebrate their progress along the proficiencies and to make 
sure that their growth continues based on the strategies taught in the integrated ELA period and across the other content 
areas.   
 
Long Term ELLs have been identified to their respective pods as students to review for grouping during RTI and for a deeper 
analysis of their diagnostic data as well as for conferencing with during review of progress reports.  They focus of support is to 
build vocabulary and literacy strategies as well as shore up students writing stamina and skills. 
 
Former ELLs remain in the pod with current ELLs to ensure that the strategies and metacognitive skills  the content teachers 
are using with ELLs continue to serve as support if needed for commanding students.  ENL teachers have also notified content 
teachers in pods where there are no ELLs if any student in their classes are former ELLs to ensure that they receive any 
additional support.  ENL teachers continue to be a resource for those teachers if necessary.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Students with IEPs will be placed in homerooms and instructional settings that adhere to the mandates of the IEP. 
Students who may not need ENL support but only language support based on cognitive/learning needs not language 
acquisition will be presented to the Language Proficiency Team to determine if the ENL designation should be removed. 
Students who need ENL support will be identified by their core teachers and IEP teacher and based on a meeting with the ENL 
teachers; support will be identified and determined. 
 
ENL teachers meet with SETTS and paraprofessionals supporting ELL-SWDs as needed to provide native language material at 
lower reading levels and share strategies to ensure that the students are engaged in grade appropriate content with as many 
supports as possible.  Specific students of concern are raised in communication between the SETTs and IEP teacher and the 
ENL teachers.  Scaffolds have been created for specific students based on their particular IEP needs in conjunction with the ELA 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

teacher, ENL teacher, SETTS teacher and the student’s particular paraprofessional.  The scaffold created a structure for the 
student to follow in all content classes to ensure each of the language modalities was practiced in each lesson. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our pod structure supports flexible scheduling and grouping to ensure that ELL-SWDs achieve their IEP goals and attain English 
proficiency within the least restrictive environment. There are two pods in every grade that follow a similar schedule to allow 
students the opportunity to be flexibly grouped. Additionally, our school-wide morning intervention blocks creates the space 
for all students to receive targeted instruction based on their needs. ELL students' IEPs are reviewed annually with parents and 
teachers. Our School Implementation Team also meets to ensure all students are making progress and program adjustments 
do not need to be made.  In all our reviews we ensure that the student is placed in the least restrictive environment Teachers 
of these students meet weekly to collaborate and ensure that the students are receiving the appropriate interventions.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Intervention is offered in reading and math during RTI period every day for all students.  Students are grouped by 
newcomer/entering/emerging status for ENL stand-alone support and the remaining students are grouped for literacy based 
on their proficiency levels and for Math based on their iReady diagnostic.  Native-language material is gathered and shared 
with content teachers through the Google platform.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our implementation of RtI school wide five days per week, with ELLs broken into groups based on NYSESLAT data, will improve 
the instruction for ELLs. For these students, we are determining the best programs to use that focus on reading and writing 
language acquisition. This also includes the explicit teaching of sounds and letters. Our ELLs will be reassessed on six-week 
cycles. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/a 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students in our building are invited to participate in LeAp after school program.. Students stay in school until 6pm. We will 
have monthly celebrations to showcase the many cultures in our building and celebrate the work students are doing. They are 
afforded equal access to all programs.  After-school and Saturday school programs are designed based on the needs identified 
within each pod and department (ELA and Math.)  Saturday Academy begins in the Winter with support leading to the ELA, 
Math, and NYSESLAT state exams. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our school offers 1:1 computer-to-student access. All ELLs are offered differentiated, technology-based instruction. We have 
iReady, Rosetta Stone, Just Words WILSON reading program, REWARDS, which we are using to support our ELLs.  Elements of 
the SIOP model are being incorporated into classroom instruction.  Additional professional development around other 
elements of SIOP will be considered as options for this school year. “ 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All Spanish-speaking ELLs who are in the entering, emerging, and transitioning proficiency levels get Spanish NLA for 45 
minutes four times a week.  From within these students, any identified as SIFE, get additional support from the NLA teacher 
(7th graders are pulled every day during the RTI block and 8th graders are pulled out during some Social Studies periods and 
are building literacy through Spanish-language Social Studies content). 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 

ELLS' ages and grade levels are taken into account during their initial placement interview. All required services and resources 
support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels based on the needs identified during the initial interview. ELLs follow 
the common core aligned curriculum for all core subjects: ELA is Code X, Math is Algebra For All, Social Studies is Passport, and 
Science follows Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The ENL class modifies core class curriculum to support their 
comprehension and improves their skills in the New York Common Core Bilingual Standards. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our LeAp after school program is a combined program for both public schools in the building. The hope is to also coordinate 
PD across schools to ensure we meet the needs and share resources for all students.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs are supported by their ENL teacher and pod teachers in understanding the dynamics of the school and all 
support staff (parent coordinator, guidance counselor, restorative practices coordinator, deans, etc.) Students engage in 
“Morning Meeting” and monthly assemblies to build community with peers.   
 
8th grade students receive high school selection orientation for students and for parents.  Students are taken to high school 
fairs, schools are brought in to speak to students in class, and teachers and the guidance counselors help students and parents 
with completing the high school selection process. 
 
Parent coordinator and community schools liaison host workshops and fairs for parents throughout the school year based on 
parent surveys 
 
ELL families will be invited to an orientation on family night orienting parents and guardians to services we provide. 
Throughout the year, we host ESL classes for adults, GED programs, and parent nights based on surveys parents take indicating 
their needs. We also host a variety of school-wide cultural celebrations that parents/guardians are invited to attend.   
 
People involved:  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The language elective offered in our school is Spanish (8  th   grade only). 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All ELL personnel participate in professional development focused on language acquisition, instructional strategies for ELLs in 
the classroom and targeted intervention to support the needs of all learners. ENL teachers will attend QTELtraining and 
turnkey training to staff in bi-weekly ELL meetings and ELA department meetings.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

 

ELL data is reviewed in weekly instructional leadership team meetings and well as Thursday department data analysis 
meetings.   ENL Teachers Joani Ramirez and Kamero Neblett will be responsible for facilitating ELL professional development 
monthly on Tuesdays, beginning in October and continuing all year.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school exceeds the professional development requirements for all teachers. All ELL teachers engage in ELL-specific 
professional development three times per week (45 minutes each time) as they meet in grade teams. The grade team 
meetings are groups by ELL and non-ELL teachers. Thus, ELL teachers meet three times per week with their ELL-specific grade 
teams to analyze ELL data and share best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction 
for ELLs. During Tuesdays, every other week, ENL teachers will provide PD for teachers of ELLS around best practices for ELL 
instruction. s 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parents of ELLs are invited to the school to meet with grade teams and discuss goals of the program, language development 
progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Our school invites 
parents for more than just the DOE-mandated meetings. As a Community Learning School and through our extended day 
program, we invite parents to participate in programs and meetings throughout the year. Parents are invited to our thrice-
weekly grade team meetings, which are broken into ELL and non-ELL grade teams. During these meetings, parents are invited 
to discuss goals, language development progress, and language needs. In this way, the school provides annual individual 
meetings with parents of ELLs. 
The ENL teachers will create a survey to identify dates and areas of focus  for the “Annual individual ELL One-on-One 
meetings.”  The survey is necessary to ensure that parents understand the difference between these meetings and 
Parent/Teacher conferences and quarterly progress report meetings.  One consideration is that the meetings be held quarterly 
by grade to support the specific needs and promotional criteria for each grade. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
ELL parents are involved in grade team activities. Because grade teams are broken down by ELL and non-ELL groups, parents of 
ELLs are specifically targeted by ELL grade teams. As a Community Learning School, we also offer services for ELL parents 
including ESL classes and technology literacy classes.  ELL parents are involved in the family nights, parent teacher conferences, 
field trips and student celebrations hosted by the ELL teachers.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lauren Hasson, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Over 25% of our parents have identified Spanish as their primary language. This has indicated to us that every 
written notice must be in both English and Spanish and that every meeting requires spanish translation. During 
registration, non-English speaking parents are provided with a home identification survey in their native language. 
We document the languages that are present in our school and work with the DOE translation services using the 
DOE Translation & Interpretation Unit as needed. The unit is used for translation of assessments analysis and 
progress reports. Continued collection of data informs the school of those parents/guardians who are in needs of 
written translation and oral interpretation. In collaboration with the UFT Community Learning Schools Initiative, 
we have sent out several surveys over the course of the past school year, and we plan to continue this practice in 
the coming years. We regularly update our knowledge of languages parents speak and analyze the data in the 
weekly Instructional Leadership Team meetings. We utilize multiple ways to collect data and convene to discuss 
our shared knowledge weekly.

At the beginning of the year we will have a professional development on the Chancellor's Regulation A-663. We will 
make all staff aware of how we will communicate with parents and families in addition to posting resources in our 
main office and having brochures available.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services

information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school surveyed all parents to assess language needs. The school will identify crucial documents that need to be 
translated at least 30 days in advance, to ensure that all necessary documents are translated and available. The school 
will create a schedule of all meetings and ensure that translation is available. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school makes use of the parent survey as well as self-created surveys and surveys created in conjunction with the 
UFT Community Learning Schools Initiative. Parents also have access to our school website, where they can provide 
feedback and take surveys. The four meetings our school has every week, during which parents can meet with every 
single teacher of their children, allow our parents ample opportunity to provide feedback, as well.
