Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 60’s Mission Statement  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

P.S. 60 recognizes that each child is an individual and respects their individual needs. PS 60 fosters a safe, caring, and 
supportive environment; and focuses on the social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development of each child. 
Student’s academic success is fostered by positive relationships with peers, staff, and parents. We strive to have our 
parents, teachers, and community members actively involved in our students’ learning. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

PS 60’s Vision Statement  

P.S. 60 will create a safe and structured environment where students and staff, along with parents and other 
stakeholders come together as a community of life-long learners. Our school will foster individual differences and 
allow all children access to learning. We will work together to support students with authentic learning experiences. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 60 is a diverse school with 832 students. To reach all students, we use Teacher's College in ELA and Exploratory 
Math. In order to implement Teacher’s College, PS 60 received funding from the PTA. This funding allowed for 
teachers to go to Teacher’s College for staff development. In addition, the principal attended workshops that 
supported administrators with the knowledge needed to nurture and support this new program. In addition, teachers 
receive professional development from Core Collaborative and National Teachers Network with a focus on 
mathematics. Teachers are changing their instructional practice to focus on implementing a conceptual understanding 
for students. Also, for the 2018-2019 school year we have departmentalized our 5th grade. PS 60 is implementing 
Algebra for All. PS 60 is also partnering with Playworks. This program is designed for organize recess. In order to meet 
students social emotional growth, it is important for students learn how to socialize during school play. Playworks 
provides staff developers to work with PS 60 staff members and students on how to implement different play 
stations. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 60 has diverse learners. We have a large population of special education students. PS 60 currently has the Horizon 
Program (8:1:1), 12:1:1 classes on grades K-4 and 12:1 classes on grades 3-5. The focus for our special education 
classes is small group instruction. In addition, flexible programming allows us to move students to the least restrictive 
environment.  

We have 58 ELL students, comprised of 7 Entering, 3 Emerging, 7 Transitioning, 18 Expanding, and 23 Commanding. 
Our ELL teacher services the children in small groups through pull out and push in programming.  

We have the Gifted and Talented program. Currently we have over 60 students who attend our gifted and talented 
program in grades 2, 3, and 4.  

To meet the needs of all these diverse learners, teachers communicate student’s needs with parents and service 
providers continually so that all stakeholders are involved in improving student achievement. Small group instruction 
is a huge part of learning at PS 60. Students participate in small groups throughout the day to focus in on their 
educational needs. 

PS 60's instructional focus this year is using formative assessment in order for students to become independent 
learners. This will allow students to engage in rigorous instruction.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

This year PS 60 made progress in all areas of the Framework for Great Schools. This school year our focus was to 
engage all students in high level discussions and higher order thinking skills through close reading and read aloud. 
Teachers participated in book clubs once a week. They read Notes and Notices and Socratic Circles. Teachers 
implemented what they learned and shared best practices. During the school year, supervisors supported staff, 
students, and the community by conducting workshops and modeling lessons.  

For the 2018-2019, PS 60 will continue to be a Teacher’s College Project School. The staff will work with Teacher’s 
College staff developers to implement reading and writing units of study. The staff developers will continue to visit

our school and model lessons for teachers. In addition to implementing Teacher's College literacy program, teachers 
have aligned all of the skills and strategies in each unit of study to the Common Core Learning Standards.  

Teachers will continue meeting each week, to look at student work as well as engage in Inquiry. By doing this they are 
able to work together collaboratively to revise their units of study and their instructional practice.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the 2017-2018 New York City Quality Guide, 98% of teachers feel that they are implementing rigorous 
instruction in literacy and 94% feel this way with math.  

In an effort to improve student achievement in mathematics, teachers will engage students in an exploratory 
approach in Math. Teachers are participating in professional development on the subject to ensure instruction is 
differentiated and hands-on. As indicated on the 2017-2018 New York State Math Assessment, currently, 62% of 
students at PS 60 are at a level 1 and level 2 in mathematics, 38% of students are proficient This data reveals a need 
for a conceptual understanding of mathematical skills. We will do that by increasing student instruction and the use of 
exploratory learning to deepen understanding. Students will continue to be expected to explain their thinking in 
mathematics both verbally and written. 

Students in grades K through 5 will increase their math level and mathematical skills through hands-on and 
differentiated math activities. To achieve these goals, the following will be implemented: 

 

 
 

Students in grades K-5 will engage in exploratory mathematical activities that are student led and promote 
mathematical discourse. Students will model mathematical problems, question each others thinking, lead 
discussions, and give helpful feedback to each other. The teachers will facilitate these discussions. 
Students in grades K-5 will work in collaborative groups according to soft and hard data. 
Students will participate in Test Prep classes after school and on weekends to help achieve this goal. 

In an effort to improve student achievement in Literacy, teachers will build student comprehension, writing skills and 
overall skills in communication. As indicated on the 2017-2018 New York State English Language Arts Assessment, 
currently, 54% of students are reading at level 1 and level 2, while 46% of students are proficient. Students need 
advanced levels of literacy to perform their jobs, run their household, act as citizens and conduct their personal lives. 
According to the Common Core Reading Instructional Shift in ELA/Literacy, students need to read a true balance of 
informational and literary texts.  

Students in grades K through 5 will increase their reading levels by participating in strategy groups and guided reading 
groups. They will practice their individual goals as well as use authentic strategies to further their comprehension of 
varied texts. To achieve these goals, the following will be implemented: 

 

 

Students in grades K-1 will engage in small groups focusing on strategies that revolve around their individual 
goals that are acquired from running records and guided reading data. 
Students in grades 2-5 will engage in strategy groups that revolve around their individual goals that are pulled 
from their pre assessments in reading. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2017-2018 New York City Quality Guide, 96% of teachers feel that they collaborate on a regular 
basis.  

After reviewing student's May 2018 running records, 8% of all students are reading at a level 1. In addition, 20% of all 
students are reading at a level 2. As a result of teacher teams focusing on best practices related to guided reading and 
student conferring 65% of students in grades 3-5 will demonstrate grade level proficiency as measured by Teacher's 
College Running Records. Based on this, PS 60 will continue working with Teacher's College staff developers and Core 
Collaborative to work together to revise and create lessons that support our struggling learners.  

Through grade impact team meetings, instructional teams and professional development, teachers will be working 
collaboratively to develop and revise lessons that fully engage students in literary conversations and mathematical 
practices. These discussions include citing text evidence, distinguishing major and minor details, expressing opinions, 
making supporting arguments, and use mathematical reasoning. Teachers will engage in professional development 
around planning literacy lessons and math lessons using focused standards. By using focused standards for each unit 
of study in literacy and math, students will become fluent. By focusing on these areas, students will increase their 
comprehension and math skills. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of all teacher teams' collaboratively focusing on best teaching practices, as measured by New 
York State Assessments, students will increase their proficiency levels by 5% in ELA and Math as compared to 2018 State 
Assessments.

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2017-2018 New York City Quality Guide, 94% of teachers feel the principal has effective instructional 
leadership, 90% of teachers feel there is program coherence, and 90% of parents feel there is inclusive principal 
leadership. 

Effective leaders have high expectations of their staff and students. Teachers will set smart goals for themselves 
based on their Measure Of Teacher Practice (MOTP) from the previous year. This instructional goal will be supported 
by administrators and will allow staff to grow and develop professionally.  

As indicated on the 2017-2018 Advance reports, 15% of all teachers have been rated developing on their instructional 
practice. 

Administration and teachers meet after all observations to discuss growth and next steps. Administrators will track 
teacher feedback by using a chart and meet twice a week to discuss feedback and next steps. These discussions are 
held as a means to improve pedagogical practices and student achievement. Inter-visitations and professional 
development are utilized to support teachers and improve their practices. 

Teachers are able to set goals for themselves and reflect upon those goals. In addition, the school's strengths are 
supporting teachers with best instructional practice. Teachers need to continue to improve their content knowledge 
with the support of the leaders in their building. Teachers will track their professional growth by documenting all the 
professional development they attend for their goal and the schools goals. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Recruitment: 

  Partner with CSI – student teachers – serves to identify aspiring and potentially highly effective teachers.  
  Conduct rigorous interviews, and when possible, require demonstration lessons to ensuring the hiring of 

highly qualified and talented personnel 

Retention: 

  Experienced teachers serve as a mentors to new, untenured, and inexperienced teachers. 
  All teachers on each grade, have a common preparation/planning period one day per week – teachers use this 
time to make curricular adjustments as need and co-plan throughout the week. New teachers use this time to 
meet with experienced staff members on their grade to assist in planning. 
Scheduled 6th preparation period for teachers to participate in inquiry work (Impact Teams). Teachers look at 
pre and post assessments to meet the needs of all the students in their class.  
Support 

 
  Through the adoption of the CCLS-aligned Teachers College and Eureka Math curricula and related 

 

professional development specifically geared toward the effective implementation of these curricula in our 
classrooms, we have been able to support our teachers in the initial roll out of these rigorous programs. 
Dozens of teachers attended professional development over the summer to begin preparing for such, and a 
team of twelve teachers regularly attend curriculum team sessions and subsequently turnkey the important 
learnings at upcoming school-based staff development days.  
Staff development is: ongoing throughout the year, sometimes supported by outside consultants, conducted 
through the turn-keying of information from teachers who attend PD workshops, sometimes led by the 
administration, aligned to the schools' instructional focus, and is conducted regularly throughout the year 
during our Monday afternoon professional development, common planning periods during the week, and on 
staff development days.  
Shared with teachers a lesson planning template that is aligned to the Danielson framework – this template 
includes a piece for reflection so teachers can thoughtfully ponder how best to refine their lesson for the 
future to better meet the needs of their students or deliver the content in more engaging manner, etc. 

 

 

  Utilized Monday and Tuesday for professional learning community meetings/teacher team meetings where 

teachers engage in inquiry work and monitoring the gaps and trends in alignment with the CCLS – we are also 
using this time to begin planning math lesson aligned to the CCLS.

  Teachers turn-key every Monday afternoon information they acquired from professional development. 
 

Send numerous staff members to various professional development workshops (including Teachers College 
and Core Collaborative) with the expectation that those attending will turnkey important and relevant 
information to their colleagues. 

  Conduct periodic Danielson study groups in which teachers discuss how specific components of the Danielson 

framework apply to their grade-level work and the curriculum. 

 

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
 Staff development is: ongoing throughout the year, sometimes supported by outside consultants, conducted 
through the turn-keying of information from teachers here who attend PD workshops, sometimes led by the 
administration, aligned to the citywide instructional expectations, at times, conducted as a "lunch and learn", and 
takes place regularly throughout the year during our Monday and Tuesday afternoons professional learning 
community meetings, common planning periods during the week, and on staff development days. In addition, 
teachers attend 25 days at Teacher’s College and Teacher’s College staff developers visit PS 60 20x for professional 
development. 

 We attempt to build capacity in our efforts in the following ways: 

 -6 th preparation period inquiry meetings: look for trends in analyzing data, create areas of concern, develop lessons 
and group students based on need. 

 Staff developers from Teachers College work with K-2 teachers 10x and 3-5 teachers 10x in the 2015-2016 school 
year. 

 PLCs are led by grade leaders and focus on looking a student work, grade-wide trends  

 Allocated per session funding for an afterschool instructional team in which the principal, supervisors, and grade 
leaders meet regularly to ensure that as a school, we are focused on implementing the citywide instructional 
expectations, which include conducting inquiry work, gaining a deep understanding of the Danielson framework, 
developing/identifying uniform assessments to serve as the basis for inquiry work and data-driven instruction, and 
implementing/modifying curricula that is challenging for all students yet still provides ample opportunities for success 

 Supervisor sets up schedule for administration of Performance Series three times throughout the year – teachers 
can access data to drive their instruction 

 Teachers share best practices during PLCs relating to conferencing notes 

 Teachers are provided with data gathering templates as suggested methods of recording data from formal/informal 
assessments to adjust instruction and as the basis for flexible grouping/re-teaching/differentiation 

 Purchased both the Teachers College Literacy curriculum and Eureka Math program as these curricula are fully 
aligned to CCLS and address the key shifts, instructional supports, and rigorous assessments demanded by the 
Common Core

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State,

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 



Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 60, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

PS 60's Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by PS 60.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

 

PS 60 will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Based on 2018 NYSESLAT and current NYSITELL scores, 31% of our ELLs are on the EN/EM level; 19% 
are on the TR level, and 50% are at the EX level.   Of the  ELLs tested in 2018, 6 students scored at a Level 1 
and 2 students scored at a Level 2 on the ELA.  Out of this number of test takers, 4 are ELL-
SWD students.  Our school focus is to continue to improve communication skills by fostering peer 
conversations with small group talk on a variety of topics and genres as well as improve different types of 
writing such as narratives, argumentative writing, and research.   
For our Title III supplemental program, our Kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade and newcomers of all 
grades will be invited to participate in an interactive after-school program.  Students will be exposed to all 
modalities of language through the use of several supplemental programs including National 
Geographic/Cengage's Reach program, BrainPop, Award Reading and various games.  Through the use of big 
books, charts, and realia, students will be encouraged to participate in group discussions and in shared writing 
activities.  These materials and programs are supplemental and and are not used in our daily program.  This af
ter-school program will lead to more oral conversations and independent writing.  This program focuses on 
science and social studies topics and concepts.   
After looking at our recent ELA scores, very few ELLs score a 2 or higher.  During the 2018-19 school year, 
we will purchase Get Set Reading NY from Continental to use in our after school program.  These materials 
are aligned to the Common Core Standards and focus on non fiction texts and strategies.  In addition, we will 
continue to use the Lego Education Story Starter program. This highly engaging, interactive program meets 
Common Core and State Standards.  The students enjoyed this program and were actively engaged in creating 
different scenes, storytelling with partners and writing their stories. Using Legos as a springboard for 
creativity, this program strengthens literacy skills by enhancing speaking, listening, reading, writing and 
comprehension skills.  Students will continue to create stories by using their imagination and language; work 
collaboratively;  and document their stories with different types of writing such as interviews, articles, and 
reports.  Students will use the Story Visualizer software by creating and writing their stories on laptops with 
the option of using pre-existing templates.  The Story Starter program covers many different topics such as 
fairy tales, communities and space exploration.   
We are inviting all of our ELL students on all proficiency levels from grades K-5 to participate in this Title 
III after school program.  The program will take place every Thursday from 2:25 pm - 3:55 pm beginning in 
October 2018 and ending in May 2019.     
All instruction will be in English. 
The ENL teacher, Mrs. Kaplan will conduct the program.   
In order to provide home language support, students will be encouraged to "buddy up" with other students 
speaking the same language.  Students will then have the opportunity to speak in their native language with 
their peers.  Entering and emerging students already fluent in their native language are encouraged to respond 
and/or write in their native language as they continue to acquire English literacy skills.  We plan on 
purchasing additional bilingual books to expand our existing bilingual library. Currently, our bilingual library 
contains books in Spanish, Albanian, Arabic, Chinese, Urdu, Italian, Hebrew, Polish and Portuguese. In 
addition to adding more books in these languages, we also plan on adding books in Chinese and Russian to 
accommodate our newly enrolled students who speak those languages at home. 
The 3rd, 4th and 5th graders will have the opportunity to go to one of Disney's Broadway shows in the spring 
of 2019.  They will participate in an interactive pre-theater workshop in which they perform a skit based on 
the show they will be attending.  After the show, we will participate in a talk-back whereby the students will

Attendance records will be maintained for each session and kept in the ENL teacher's blue binder. 
Notification about the Title III programs will be sent home in the parents' preferred languages.  Descriptions 
of the programs will also be discussed during the Parent Orientation meetings.  All information will be posted

Other dates to be determined based on SIBFSC ELL PD calendar.      
PD will be provided during the allocated Monday PD time of 2:25 - 3:40 or as indicated above.   
Classroom teachers of ELLs will be given the choice to participate in our after-school ELL Book 
Club.  The book club will be led by the ENL teacher, Mrs. Kaplan.  This year, the Book Club 
will read and discuss Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning, Second Edition by Pauline 
Gibbons.  This 10-week book club is scheduled on Mondays from 3:45-4:45 from November 5,

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
PS 60 always encourages parent involvement.  Due to the Common Core Learning Standards, the 
implementation of Teacher College strategies, the Eureka math program, and current social 
issues, we are assisting parents to help their children academically and socially at home. Our 
Parent Coordinator conducts a parent survey at the beginning of every school year asking what 
types of support they would like or need. The majority of parents asked for workshops to gain 
insight into what is happening in the classrooms.  Classroom teachers will provide many of the 
workshops using the same terminology used in the classroom. This is extremely helpful for our 
ELL parents in order for them to become familiar with the everyday language their children are 
learning and conversing within the school.  As a result, a variety of parent workshops will be 
offered every month throughout the school year. At the request of the parents, most of the 
workshops will be held during the school day.  All parents including our ELL parents are always 
invited to attend.  All workshop notifications are sent home and posted on the school's 
website.  All postings on the school's website can be translated into the parents' preferred 
languages. Bilingual paraprofessionals and/or outside translators will be available as indicated by 
parent request for all workshops.  
For all parents including our ELL parents, the following Parent Engagement activities will take

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  
PS 60 follows the Teachers College Reading and Writing Curriculum.  Our school uses a variety of assessment tools to assess 
the early literacy skills of our ELLs.  Grades K- 5 uses Running Records to assess reading fluency and comprehension.  Our Fall, 
2018 Running Record assessment begins in October 2018.  Grades 2-5 use Ed Performance. All teachers are using the 
Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Assessment.  These assessments help determine fluency and comprehension levels, 
which result in creating individual goals for each student and monthly classroom goals. All teachers identify specific student 
needs through TC Assessment Pro to align instruction accordingly.  Teachers use this data when they meet during inquiry time 
to determine their small group instruction and mini-lessons.  This data also helps determine which strategies need to be 
modified or implemented to provide multiple entry points.  The data also indicate what level students are reading.  This 
enables teachers to meet students needs through guided reading and small group instruction.  This also helps students with 
self-reflection and setting goals in each content area. Mrs. Kaplan, the ENL teacher uses this data to determine reading 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

fluency, accuracy, and comprehension to plan stand-alone or small group ENL instruction.  Our school evaluates the success of 
our ELL's based on how many students advance proficiency levels based on the NYSESLAT, show progress based on the last 
two years of the NYSESLAT, and achieve proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  The ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) helps us analyze this 
data.  Using this tool provides information including NYSESLAT data progress and proficiency; provides a list of at-risk students 
and guidance support;  provides modality strengths and weaknesses; provides a comparison between ELLs and non-ELLs on 
NYS content area exams.  We also evaluate the success of our ELLs based on students scores on the content area tests such as 
the English Language Arts exam, NYS Math test, and 4th grade Science test.   
   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The TCRWP running record assessment is given three times a year in September, January and June.  The September and June 
assessments are used as the MOSL.  The last running record is administered by the classroom teacher and graded by a 
different teacher to ensure validity.  All classroom teachers review the data acquired from the MOSL determines student 
progress from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.  Classroom teachers work as teams to review the data and 
collaborate with related providers including Mrs. Kaplan, the ENL teacher.  Information from the NYSESLAT including 
proficiency levels and students' language abilities is shared with the classroom teachers.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Teachers create pre and post assessments after each unit of study in reading, writing, and math.  Rubrics are used to ensure 
consistent and valid scores for all students across the grades, including ELLs.  Informal On Demand writing pieces are used as 
pre-assessments and compared to their final writing pieces.  Data from these assessments enable us to determine where 
additional help may be needed and how Title III funded supplemental programs are created.  Success criteria are generated for 
students to self-monitor their understanding of a lesson in order to complete their assignment. Pre-assessments guide 
instructional planning for the upcoming unit, whereas post assessments guide further small-group instruction if needed.  Other 
informal assessments that teachers use to identify targeted students are writing prompts, informal class assessments, 
conferencing, exit slips, and observations.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been reviewed, classroom interventions include focused small-group instruction and guided 
reading groups to address areas of concern.  Students create their own goals to focus on areas they would like to improve. 
Classroom teachers make RtI recommendations for further support.  Classroom teachers inform related providers including 
Mrs. Kaplan, the ENL teacher of this data to support the ELLs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Informal assessments help determine if there is a language acquisition issue or a learning disability issue. Other factors taken 
into consideration are the number of years of ENL instruction the child received, English and home language literacy, cultural 
differences, teacher recommendations, parent requests, student work, and if necessary, a bilingual evaluation.  RtI will also 
inform teachers of other issues besides language acquisition.  In order to guide instruction for ELLs within the RtI framework, 
we screen all students including ELLs with our beginning year assessments, such as TC Running Records, Oral Language 
Proficiency Checklist, Ed Performance and Sight Word Inventories.  SIFE students are given the LENS.  All classroom teachers 
use the TCRWP assessments.  The ENL teacher and classroom teachers use the NYSITELL, Spanish LAB and NYSESLAT results to 
indicate whether an ELL student needs Tier 1 RtI along with continued ENL services.   RtI support includes additional small 
group instruction with the classroom teacher and/or small group instruction with the Academic Intervention Support (AIS) 
teacher and/or participating in the Orton-Gillingham program.     
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

**The data will be updated in September to reflect the 2018 scores.** 
The NYSITELL and NYSESLAT will be used to determine ENL program delivery and the number of mandated minutes of ENL 
instruction per week.   As per CR-Part 154-2,  Entering ELLs are receiving a total of 360 minutes (2 units) of ENL instruction per 
week: 1 unit of stand-alone ENL and 1 unit of Integrated ENL.  Emerging students will also receive 2 units of ENL instruction: a 
minimum of .5 units of standalone instruction, .5 units of integrated instruction and 1 unit of either standalone or integrated 
instruction.  Transitioning students will receive a total of 1 unit of ENL instruction: .5 unit of integrated and either .5 addition 
integrated or standalone instruction.  Expanding students will receive a total of 1 unit of integrated ENL 
instruction.  Commanding students will receive a total of .5 units of integrated instruction. Currently, we have 45 active 
ELLs and 16 former ELLs.  Based on the results of the 2017 NYSESLAT and the latest NYSITELL scores, the number of students 
that make up our ELL population consists of the following proficiency levels including our current Kindergarten (out of 45 
students): 
The breakdown by grade is as follows (out of current 63 students): 
 
1 
 
The goal this year is for our current Expanding students to achieve the Commanding level on the 2018 NYSESLAT and to 
increase their performance levels on the ELA and NYS Math exams.  The EDAT will disseminate this information and analyze a 
variety of factors such as home language, grade level, years of ELL service, ELA/math performance and progress, NYSESLAT 
proficiency and progress, attendance, age, credit accumulation, holdover status, SIFE status, and disability 
classification.  Looking at our EDAT school summary report, 21.4% scored at the Commanding level.  11 students advanced 1 
proficiency level; 3 students advanced 2 proficiency levels; 2 students advanced 3 proficiency levels, and 13 students remained 
at the same proficiency levels.  No students regressed proficiency levels.  The EDAT report also shows that only 1 student 
scored at or below the 25th growth percentile and scored a level 1 or 2 on the ELA and Math.  The NYSESLAT shows that the 
reading modality is our ELLs greatest area of weakness in our upper grades, whereas as 2nd grade ELLs showed a weakness in 
the writing modality.                       
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL integrated and stand-alone schedule will reflect all students' proficiency levels based on the 2017-18 NYSESLAT and 
the NYSITELL for new students to meet the mandated number of minutes in an ENL program and type of delivery.  Each 
student will be scheduled according to these mandates as per CR-Part 154-2.  Mrs. Kaplan, the ENL teacher, will coordinate 
with the classroom teachers to implement appropriate strategies and lessons to meet the needs of all ELLs.  Mrs. Kaplan will 
also continue to incorporate Orton-Gillingham strategies to use in the ENL stand-alone classroom.  Title III after-school 
programs such as Lego Story Starter and Get Set Reading NY will continue to address the needs of our ELLs in the content areas 
with the focus on literacy skills. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In order to meet CR Part 154.2 mandates, students are grouped according to their NYSESLAT/NYSITELL proficiency 
levels.  In all grades, all Entering and Emerging students will receive 180 minutes of Integrated 
heterogeneous instruction in the general education classroom per grade. They will also receive 180 minutes of stand-
alone heterogeneous, un-graded instruction in the ENL classroom.  Transitioning students will receive either 180 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

minutes of heterogeneously integrated instruction in the general education classroom or a combination of 90 minutes 
heterogeneously integrated instruction and 90 minutes of heterogeneous un-graded stand-alone instruction in the 
ENL classroom. Expanding students will receive 180 minutes or 1 unit of heterogeneous ENL instruction in the general 
education classroom.  Commanding students will receive 90 minutes of integrated heterogeneous instruction in the 
general education classroom by grade level.  All integrated instruction is grouped by grade.  The ENL teacher, Mrs. 
Kaplan is dually licensed in BOTH K-12 TESOL and K-8 Common Branches.  
 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Currently, we do not have 15 parents in two contiguous grades requesting a Bilingual or Dual Language program. 
However, as per Aspira Consent Decree, once we have the sufficient number of parents requesting these programs, 
we will contact the DoE for grant guidelines and regulations.     

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Currently, we do not have 15 parents in two contiguous grades requesting a Bilingual or Dual Language program. 
However, as per Aspira Consent Decree, once we have the sufficient number of parents requesting these programs, 
we will contact the DoE for grant guidelines and regulations.        

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided by the ENL teacher, Mrs. Kaplan, 
according to the proficiency levels of the students by following the CR Part 154-2 requirements.  The RLAT report indicates the 
proficiency levels based on the results of the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL.  EN and EM students receive 360 minutes of ENL 
instruction through the content areas of literacy, math, social studies, and science.  TR and EX students receive 180 minutes of 
ENL instruction through the content areas. CM ELLs will receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction through the content areas.  All 
General education ELLs (if classroom max limits allow) are placed in the same classroom by grade in order to accommodate 
integrated ELL support.   
Home Language Arts support is delivered through our bilingual paras, translation dictionaries, and native language libraries. 
Wherever possible, students are paired with other students speaking the same native language. Content is age/grade/ 
culturally appropriate.  Our book of the month for each month this year focuses on empathy and the ability to understand 
another person's feelings.  Upper-grade newcomers are encouraged to respond in their native language until they are 
comfortable responding in English.    
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Our school’s ENL program encompasses an academic discipline designed to allow students to acquire English language 
proficiencies, and meet the Next Generation Learning Standards.  Students receive all instruction in English, with Native 
Language support.  Our ENL program tailors the needs of our ELL students and promotes academic rigor through the 
implementation of differentiated instruction and scaffolding.  The students are seen by an ENL teacher dually licensed in K-12 
TESOL and K-8 Common Branches.  Mandated Stand-Alone ENL instructional time is delivered in a print-rich and inviting 
classroom.  The classroom provides evidence of rigorous instruction with student work prominently displayed as well as word 
walls, charts, maps, and posters. In addition to the ENL instructional materials and resources, content area instruction will also 
include a variety of strategies including SIOP to make content comprehensible for all ELL students.  In addition to the ENL 
instructional materials and resources, content area instruction will also include a variety of strategies to make content 
comprehensible for all ELL students. Cengage/National Geographic’s REACH Program provides an engaging, interactive 
program for ELLs that are aligned to the CCLS.  Scaffolds are embedded in the program to help move each student to a higher 
level of independent learning.  Learning A-Z with the enhanced ELL component is another engaging resource providing high-
interest reading materials leveled to the student’s ability with an emphasis on vocabulary development. Mandated integrated 
ELL support is delivered in a collaborative effort by the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher for each grade.  The ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

teacher works with classroom teacher teams to plan lessons and strategies for the ELL students in all content areas.  Whereas 
the classroom teacher focuses on content, the ENL teacher focuses on language strategies, comprehension and vocabulary 
development.higher level, independent learning.  Learning A-Z with the enhanced ELL component is another engaging

students in all content areas.  Whereas the classroom teacher focuses on content, the ENL teacher focuses on language 
strategies, comprehension and vocabulary development. 
 
ELA instruction in the general education classes is provided by Teachers College Reading and Writing Project.  Instructional 
implications for ELLs will include the level of text complexity, explicit vocabulary mini-lessons, the repetitiveness of texts and 
supplemental lessons about the English language.   Our school also uses the Orton-Gillingham approach to decoding words and 
improve reading and writing skills.  Math instruction is based on the Common Core Learning Standards.  Students use a 
constructiveness approach to develop conceptual understanding.   This is done through student-led discussions, use of 
manipulatives, gallery walks, peer review, and feedback.  Small group instruction is provided for extra support by both the 
classroom and ENL teacher.  Our social studies and science curriculum follow the NYS Scope and Sequence, incorporating the 
Next Generation Learning Standards. Harcourt Science New York City edition is used for all students in all grades.  ELL 
strategies and scaffolding techniques are embedded within this program.   Instructional approaches include the use of ENL 
methodologies such as, Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP), Quality Teaching for English Language Learners 
(QTEL) strategies, Total Physical Response (TPR) methods, Orton-Gillingham, and Lilly Wong Fillmore’s Deconstructing 
Sentences which provide additional support with comprehensible background and vocabulary.   Students engage in various 
oral language games and activities such as Mix and Mingle, Conga Line and 4 Corners.  Most activities are structured to 
promote collaborative learning and to foster language growth by listening and speaking with one another.  A leveled library is 
maintained to provide instructional and independent reading based on the student’s running records.  Native language 
libraries, bilingual paraprofessionals, and translation dictionaries support ELLs in their native languages. The Google Translate 
app and the Say Hi app helps provide quick translations of written material.  Classroom teachers of ELLs and the ENL teacher 
use iPods for instant access to translation apps and images.  YouTube videos are shown to promote fluency and 
comprehension of stories, academic content or reinforcement of material learned and video aloud mini-lessons. Videos also 
provide visuals and background of new or unknown content.  Upper grade students who can read and write in their native 
language are encouraged to use their native language for oral and/or written responses.  In the ENL classroom, children are 
also encouraged to share their culture, special holidays and family experiences.  This provides a springboard for various 
reading and writing activities which are aligned with the Next Generation Learning Standards.            
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Throughout the school year, as newly registered Spanish speaking students are identified as ELLs, they are given the Spanish 
LAB. ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language through the use of translated state tests (if available), the use of 
translators or bilingual dictionaries.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

        a.  At present, we do not have any students identified as SIFE.  However, should a SIFE student enroll in our school (after 
the SIFE identification process is completed), their needs will be addressed through more individualized instruction, visual 
materials, scaffolding strategies and peer grouping with students speaking the same language.  We will research for any 
available SIFE grants.  A SIFE library has been established in our school library with a variety of content area books including 
social studies and science.  Students will also participate in small group learning using the Orton-Gillingham approach. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

        b. Differentiated instruction will be adapted to address the newcomers.  Newcomers will receive more small group 
instruction utilizing more visual/aural strategies, realia, and meaningful context.  If possible, newcomers will be paired with an 
advanced or English proficient student who speaks the same native language.  Cengage/National Geographic’s Reach Program 
will offer a variety of fiction and non-fiction texts, graphic organizers, interactive language/vocabulary activities, sight word 
mini-books and other valuable resources to increase our newcomers' language acquisition.  Technological interactive activities 
such as Award Reading, Discovery Education, Starfall and other educational websites will be utilized.  Identified second graders 
receive AIS small group instruction in reading and writing.  Newcomers in grades K-5, along with all current and former ELLs 
will be invited to participate in our Title III after-school programs to further increase language and content area skills. The ENL 
teacher, Mrs. Kaplan will also utilize the Orton-Gillingham approach to help with decoding strategies.  Various oral language 
activities including turn and talks, games and interactive vocabulary development will also be incorporated in the stand alone 
program. 
  
        c.  4-6 year ELLs will continue to receive rigorous instruction in all language modalities as described above. Data from the 
NYSESLAT, ELA, State Math Tests as well as other formal assessments are analyzed to determine small group and 
differentiated instruction for these students.  The trend in the last few years show that writing is an area of weakness for our 
4-6 year ELLs.  Writing will be a focal point in ENL instruction as well as in the General Ed classroom.  The ENL teacher will work 
individually with the students to continue working on writing pieces. Graphic organizers, repeated readings of selected texts, 
the repetitiveness of new vocabulary, and small group work will be used.  Dr. Lily Wong Fillmore’s Deconstructing Sentences 
will be a useful strategy to help our 4-6 year ELLs take apart complex sentences to comprehend their meaning.   
  
        d. Currently, we do not have long-term ELLs.  However, previous trends show that most long-term ELLs are proficient in 
oral language but are still struggling with reading and writing.  Strategies described for 4-6 year ELLs will continue to be 
used.  More metacognitive tasks, and anticipatory guides will be used in reading and writing activities.   
  
        e. Former ELLs will continue to receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL for two years after they exit the ENL program using 
ENL methodologies, strategies and small group instruction.  F-ELLs will receive 90 minutes of small group instruction up until 
January, 2019.  If progress is not shown, those identified students will receive 90 minutes of Intergrated ENL instruction.  All F-
ELLs will continue to receive ELL test modifications on all standardized tests for two years after achieving the Commanding 
level on the NYSESLAT.  All former ELLs are also invited and encouraged to participate in our Title III after-school programs 
which focus on reading, writing and preparing for the State tests.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  
        All ELLs use the same ELA program, TCRWP, and Math program, Eureka, as the general education students.  Word work is 
designed using the Orton-Gillingham approach for all grades on a daily basis.  These programs provide differentiated strategies 
for ELLs and ELL-SWDs and focus on grammar, phonics, and vocabulary.  Scaffolded instruction strategies are included as well 
by providing additional graphic organizers, and close reading of texts to gain comprehension.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs will 
provide more modeling, clarification through questioning and draw upon prior experiences to help gain understanding.  ELL-
SWDs assigned alternate placement paraprofessionals as per their IEPs get additional one-on-one guidance.  Visuals and 
interactive media also help in the progression of language development and help engage our ELL-SWDs.  All classrooms have 
access to laptops and iPads.  Various language programs and apps are used to help accelerate English language proficiency 
such as BrainPop, ABC Magic, FunBrain, Flashcards and Picture Dictionaries. 
  
         
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  
        Our ELL-SWD’s are re-evaluated according to their IEPs.  Once the re-evaluation is complete, the School Based Support 
Team meets to discuss the best and least-restrictive environment for the student.  The team reviews each student and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

determination of an ICT or self-contained recommendation is case specific.  Typically, students who are less than two years 
below grade level and are capable of receiving remediation will be placed into an ICT class. The bilingual evaluation, medical 
and neurological diagnoses as well as level of deficiency determine where the child will be placed.  A collaborative team of 
classroom teachers, special ed teachers, and service providers meet in the beginning of the school year to work out a flexible 
schedule in order for the students to receive all IEP mandated services.  Copies of all schedules are available should any 
necessary schedule changes occur.  As per the Special Education Reform, ELL-SWDs who are meeting or exceeding their IEP 
goals or meeting or exceeding standards in a particular content area will be mainstreamed into a general education class 
during that content area instruction time.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
  
Our ultimate goal is to increase proficiency levels for all of our ELLs.  All content areas will apply differentiated instruction 
through scaffolding, bridging and modeling for all ELL subgroups.   Articulation between the ENL teacher, classroom teacher, 
and cluster teachers will target the needs of the student.  During the Monday, Professional Development time, the ENL teacher 
will work with the classroom teachers on planning, looking at student work and RtI strategies for the ELLs.  Targeted 
intervention services for ELA, Science and Social Studies include close reading groups, multiple entry points using a variety of 
questioning techniques, use of prior knowledge and prior experiences, sentence frames for writing, Fundations, and Lily Wong 
Fillmore's Deconstructing Sentences.  The Eureka math program also provides multiple entry points for learning with various 
strategies to solve a math problem.  Title III supplemental programs will also provide small group instruction in ELA, math 
problem solving and science for all ELL subgroups.   All instruction will be in English with bilingual word cards, dictionaries and 
pictures.  Academic Intervention Services (AIS) such as Orton-Gillingham will be recommended for Developing ELLs who may 
require more support in reading and writing.  ELL-SWD’s will receive additional services such as Speech, OT and PT as per their 
IEP’s. 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 
Based on our ELLs ELA test scores, we plan to purchase the Get Set for Reading NY materials for our ELLs in grades 3 -5 to use 
in our Title III program.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

  
We do not have a bilingual program. 
   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are given equal access to ALL school programs.  We invite all of our ELLs and former ELLs in grades K-5 through written 
notification to participate in our Title III after-school programs to further their language skills and increase vocabulary.  This 
program will be offered on Thursdays beginning October 4 and ending May 30, 2019.   
 
Our Kindergarten, 1st grade, 2nd grade and newcomers of all grades will be invited to participate in an interactive after-school 
program.  Students will be exposed to all modalities of language through the use of several different programs including 
National Geographic/Cengage's Reach program, BrainPop, Award Reading and various games.  Through the use of big books, 
charts, and realia, students will be encouraged to participate in group discussions and in shared writing activities.  This will lead 
to more independent writing.  This program focuses on science and social studies topics and concepts.   
After looking at our recent ELA scores, very few ELLs score a 2 or higher.  During the 2018-19 school year, we will purchase Get 
Set Reading NY from Continental to use in our after school program.  These materials are aligned to the Common Core 
Standards and focus on non fiction texts and strategies.  In addition, we will continue to use the Lego Education Story Starter 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

program. This highly engaging, interactive program meets Common Core and State Standards.  The students enjoyed this 
program and were actively engaged in creating different scenes, storytelling with partners and writing their stories. Using 
Legos as a springboard for creativity, this program strengthens literacy skills by enhancing speaking, listening, reading, writing 
and comprehension skills.  Students will continue to create stories by using their imagination and language; work 
collaboratively;  and document their stories with different types of writing such as interviews, articles, and reports.  Students 
will use the Story Visualizer software by creating and writing their stories on laptops with the option of using pre-existing 
templates.  The Story Starter program covers many different topics such as fairy tales, communities and space exploration.   
For all of these supplemental programs, letters inviting the students are sent home, posted on our school’s website and 
attached in the Parent Coordinator's email blasts.  All written notification is sent in the parents' preferred languages.  All 
school programs are posted on our school's website, the Parent Coordinator's page and on the ENL Teacher's page.  The 
website can be translated into over 100 languages.  Mrs. Bonanno, our principal, sends out a weekly message to all of our 
parents through our telephone messaging system about our events and activities.  Our Parent Coordinator, Mrs. Pellegrino, 
sends out a weekly or bi-weekly email blast informing all parents of all school events and activities. 
 
Parents of ELLs will be invited to attend a new workshop titled, Navigating the PS 60 Website on October 10 - daytime and 
October 15 - evening.  As all of our important information is posted on our website, we would like the parents to be familiar 
with the website and how to stay informed of all of our school events and classroom activities.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
P.S. 60 implements a variety of programs and materials for grades K-5, including small-group instruction for ELLs. TCRWP is 
used for all students for ELA instruction.   Eureka Math using the constructivist approach is used for all students for Math 
instruction.  Both program include supports for ELLs including scaffolding strategies and multiple entry points.  Our Art 
program follows the Blue Print for the Arts.  P.S. 60's  ELL instructional plan aligns to the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  The major skill areas of listening, speaking, reading and writing and critical areas in thinking are focused 
upon.  There is an emphasis on the concepts of cross-cultural/multi-cultural understanding and responsibility.  ENL also 
prepares our ELLs to understand and use English in various contexts. Social and academic English instruction is provided 
through the use of ENL methodologies and scaffolding. Cengage/National Geographic’s Reach program for grades K-1 provides 
active learning using rich fiction and non-fiction texts in all content areas.  The Reach program provides culturally diverse 
academic content that supports our ELLs diverse backgrounds.  Award Reading developed by The Sunshine Group, provides a 
highly interactive and engaging reading program that integrates technology across all content areas.  Students will use laptops, 
texts and authentic materials to develop language and comprehension skills.  Newcomers, year 4-6 ELLs and special education 
ELLs alike all receive this instruction. In ENL, lessons are created based on engaging, rich, quality texts to increase vocabulary, 
language and reading comprehension.  To supplement the ENL program,  additional materials include visual language cards, 
electronic reading cards, poems, short stories, big books, bilingual books in various languages, bilingual dictionaries and multi-
cultural books.  All of our regular classroom utilize SmartBoards for all content areas providing visually and aurally stimulating 
interactive lessons and activities.  All teachers have access to iPads and laptops to further technological and interactive 
learning.  Other technology infused programs include Learning A-Z, online bilingual dictionaries and games.  The Google 
Translate and Say Hi apps are used to quickly translate written text and/or short stories.  All general education teachers of 
ELLs are equipped with iPods loaded with the translation apps in order to immediately translate oral communication 
effectively.  
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

  
In order to support the students’ various native languages, bilingual and native language books are available in the school 
library and the ENL classroom.  Bilingual paraprofessionals are available to provide additional support. Those students who can 
read and/or write in their native language are encouraged to do so until they become more comfortable in reading and writing 
in English.  Our bilingual paraprofessionals will assist in translating the students’ writing pieces in order to be assessed. 
Accommodations will also be made to partner the student with another student who speaks the same language. 
   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  
All required services and resources support and correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels.  ELLs are grouped at their grade level 
with one classroom teacher to enable integrated ENL service. For any standalone ENL services, ELLs will be grouped by grade 
with no more than a two-grade span per group.  The ENL teacher scaffolds and differentiates for individual learners using 
rigorous, grade-level texts. All ELLs are expected to demonstrate grade-level content-area learning at their proficiency 
level.  All programs are designed to meet grade level Common Core learning standards.  Age appropriate material is available 
as low-level/high interest texts, especially with the Reach and Learning A-Z interactive programs.   
   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
PS 60 does not share a building.  
 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
  
To assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year, our Parent Coordinator, Mrs. 
Pellegrino,  provides a parent orientation for all incoming Kindergarten students every June.  This meeting provides parents 
and students an opportunity to visit classrooms and meet classroom teachers, providers, the Guidance Counselor and the ENL 
teacher.  As new ELLs enroll throughout the year, the ENL Teacher and Parent Coordinator offer Parent Orientation meetings 
to the parents.  If class size allows, we try to place the new ELL in a class with other children who speak the same 
language.  Throughout the year, new eligible ELL students are identified through the Home Language Identification Survey 
(HLIS) and are administered the NYSITELL within 10 days of registration.  If eligible, based on the scores, the new ELL is placed 
in an appropriate grade-level group in the ENL program and programmed into STARS. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At this time, we do not offer any language electives to ELLs other than English.     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

  
Currently, we do not have 15 parents in two contiguous grades requesting a Bilingual or Dual Language 
program. However, as per Aspira Consent Decree, once we have the sufficient number of parents 
requesting these programs, we will contact the DoE for grant guidelines and regulations.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
During Monday and Tuesday professional development, teachers will be participating in book clubs focusing on higher level 
questions and discussion.  In addition, teachers will engage in 10 professional development visits from Teacher's College staff 
developers.  Also, teachers will be able to go Teacher's College and attend in-house workshops based on best teaching 
practices in ELA. 
  
The ENL teacher, Mrs. Kaplan will continue to attend workshops provided by the Staten Island Borough Field Support Center. 
These workshops support new initiatives and mandates that ELL teachers have to follow in order to serve ELL students.  Mrs. 
Kaplan will turn-key these workshops to teachers of ELLs on a monthly basis.  Planned PD for the 2018-19 school year will 
include topics yet to be determined.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The school meets the required professional development hours by conducting in-house professional development from 
Teacher's College and sending teachers to Teacher's College.  Each time a teacher attends professional development, agendas 
and attendance are kept in a binder.  Hours are tracked to ensure that 15% of professional development is dedicated to 
language acquisition and 50% of the ENL teacher's professional development is focused on language acquisition in alignment 
with content area instruction and co-teaching strategies. 
 
Mrs. Kaplan will also conduct an ELL teacher book club.  The book club will begin in November, 2018 and run for 8 
sessions.  The book, entitled, Scaffolding Language, Scaffolding Learning, Second Edition by Pauline Gibbons will focus on 
various strategies and techniques that classroom teachers can provide to their ELLs. 
 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to parent-teacher conferences, quarterly meetings, and initial parent orientations, parents will be invited to 
participate individually with their child for an annual meeting to address the goals of the program, their child’s language 
development progress, their child’s English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all 
content areas. Pertinent staff will be invited to attend these individual parent meetings with the ENL teacher.  Qualified 
interpreters/translators will be available or the services of the Interpretation/Translation unit will be utilized, if needed. For 
parents who cannot attend, efforts will be made to have them participate in a phone conference. These meetings may take 
place on Tuesdays during the dedicated time for parental involvement. All conferences, in school and by phone as well as any 
outreach with ELL parents will be recorded in ILOG on ATS. Hard copies will be kept in the ENL teacher’s Parent 
Communication Log.   
 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parent workshops will be provided throughout the year.  A strong connection between the school and all of our parents

Coordinator will host meetings throughout the year to foster the parent/school connection.  Parent orientations will take place 
periodically to inform parents about the ESL curriculum, standards, assessments and expectations.  The Department of 
Education’s Translation Unit will continue to provide written translation services so that parents will be notified of school 
information and events in their native languages.  Our PS 60 website also contains school information.  The website offers a 
drop-down menu of over 100 different languages for parents to choose from in order to translate the information.  Many 
teachers, including the ENL teacher, use Class Dojo as another way to correspond with parents.  Title III funds will be utilized 
for parent events throughout the year, including our annual ESL International Tea and Bilingual Storytelling events. These 
exciting events bring the parents, students, and teachers together to celebrate the cultural diversity in our school. All parents 
are invited to our annual Dance Festival, Mother/Son Art Nights, Father/Daughter Dance Nights, Movie Nights, the 3rd grade 
International Dance, 4th and 5th grade concerts and PTA events.  All parents are also invited to attend all monthly PTA 
meetings, attend Open School week, meet with teachers during individual Parent meetings and at Parent Teacher 
Conferences.  Bilingual paras are available at all parent functions. All parents are invited to attend all workshops.  The

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Donna Bonanno, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Upon registration, parents of first time entrants to PS 60 indicate their preferred method of oral and written 
communication on Part III of the HLIS and a separate Parent Preferred Language form. This information is inputted 
into ATS through the QADM screen. This information is also written on our student emergency cards. We also 
have Language Identification Posters posted throughout our school building. ‘I Speak’ brochures and Language 
cards are available to parents. We use the RAPL and RCPL reports on ATS to determine the parents’ preferred 
language for both oral and written communication. In the beginning of the new school year, as we receive the 
new completed emergency cards, the preferred languages will be updated in ATS. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

The data above shows that we do not have any languages that represent at least a 10% population of our school, 
nor represent at least 20 families requesting the same language other than English.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Our school's automated phone system will reach every family in the event of a school emergency. The school will use

the emergency, we will call our remaining bilingual parents through Language Line over the phone services. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The LAC and ENL teacher will provide information regarding the available Translation and Interpretation services with 
all staff members via e-mail and staff/team meetings. The ENL teacher works closely with the staff by providing links 
to the available translated resources on the NYC DoE Intranet; provides the Language Line phone number and DBN 
information for oral translated services; provides a list of the parents' preferred languages to each classroom teacher; 
provides the language guides to the staff and is available to assist with translation issues as needed.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The multilingual Welcome Poster is displayed in the lobby. The Parents' Guide to Language Access and Language ID 
cards are available at the security desk, main office and parent coordinator's office. Our school will fulfill parental 
notification requirements by providing written and oral communication in the parent's preferred language by utilizing 
the DoE's Translation Unit, Language Line, and if necessary, our bilingual paraprofessionals. Parents are also made 
aware of their right to receive information in their native language at our PTA meetings held every month.  

 

Our PS 60 website provides all pertinent school information such as parent teacher conference dates, a calendar of 
events, testing dates, parent workshops, after school programs, classroom information such as homework, tests and 
projects, school notifications, grade newsletters, parent coordinator information and photos of past events. The ENL 
teacher, Mrs. Kaplan updates the ENL Classroom page on a regular basis. All of this information can be translated into 
over 100 languages. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to gather feedback from parents, our parent coordinator conducts surveys, holds parent workshops and 
communicates with parents on the quality and availability of language services our school provides. Surveys will be 
translated through the DoE's Translation unit or through Google Translate in the parents preferred languages. The ENL 
Classroom page on our school website includes a link to the DoE's Translation and Interpretation page directing 
parents to leave feedback or comments about the language services they are receiving. Parents are always 
encouraged to contact the ENL teacher, Parent Coordinator or other staff members either by phone, email or 
messaging apps with translations such as Class Dojo. To further improve language services, we are training the staff 
how to access the archived translated documents on the DoE's intranet site and how to request documents for 
translation from the Translation Unit. The staff will all have access to Language Line in order to communicate with 
parents orally over the phone. Parents are always asked if they would like a bilingual translator during face to face 
meetings with teachers and staff. If so, a bilingual paraprofessional will be present or the Language Line interpreters 
will be called.
