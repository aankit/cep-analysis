Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of the Public School 9- Teunis G. Bergen is to teach our students how to maximize their potential 
through a constructivist model of instruction. We believe in servicing the Whole Child through strong partnerships 
as we aim to create a community of lifelong learners who are highly motivated for success. We emphasize high 
standards, professional development and the individual needs of each student. We strive to involve our parents, 
community-based organizations and the community at large in the education of our children.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
PS 9 is a Whole Child, STEAM school located in the historic brownstone Brooklyn neighborhood of Prospect Heights. 
Our diverse school is nestled directly northwest of the beautiful Prospect Park and shares our neighborhood with 
the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, Brooklyn Public Library, and Brooklyn Museum of Art. Our many strengths come 
from focusing on the Whole Child; ensuring that each child is Healthy, Safe, Engaged, Supported, and Challenged as 
outlined within the guidelines of our partnership with ASCD and the Whole Child Network. Each year our school 
partners with a number of institutions in an effort to provide our students and staff with enriched experiences and 
opportunities in science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics. We use these opportunities as part of 
our School-Wide Enrichment Program. We are a Teachers College Reading and Writing Project school and an 
OmniLearn School. Through Teachers College our teachers work within cohorts with our two consultants. All of the 
work we do with Teachers College is aligned to the common core standards and the OmniLearn component is 
aligned with the NGSS; allowing us to provide our students with rigorous, authentic instruction that provides 
support as it challenges them. Our classrooms become as Lab-sites, allowing the teachers to practice their craft 
while the consultants and their peers coach into their lessons. We study our children’s reading and writing with a 
focused lens. The main goal of our partnerships with Teachers College and OmniLearn is to engage in active 
learning of English Language Arts and Science and Math respectively, while conducting inquiry on how children 
learn. We know that in order to improve student learning and achievement, teacher practice must be 
strengthened; especially in the areas where students show a deficit. 

We have designed our Arts partnerships for our student population so that each grade is aligned to both a specific 
Arts organization, with either social studies or science as the focus. Our students in Pre-K receive visual arts from 
Studio In a School. The work is aligned to their social studies curriculum as much as possible. Students in 
Kindergarten receive visual arts from Studio In a School, with an alignment to their social studies curriculum. 
Students in Grades 1 and 2 receive visual arts/movement from Marquis Studio, and their work is aligned to their 
science curriculum. Students in Grades 3, 4 and 5 receive visual arts from the Guggenheim Museum, with an 
alignment to their social studies curriculum. Students in Grades 1-3 participate in the Musical Theater Program with 
Marquis Studio. Additionally, our students in grades 2-5 are given the opportunity to be a part of the Noel Pointer 
String Orchestra, and students in Grade 2 are given the opportunity to take part in the swim program associated 
with NYC Parks and Recreation. Our students in Grades K-5 are given the opportunity to be a part of the NYC 
Mighty Milers and Road Runners Program. Students in Grade 3 are given invited to audition for and become a part 
of the Ballet Tech Dance Program. Students in Grade 5 all engage in ballroom dancing with the Dancing Classrooms 
Program. Students in Grade 4 engage in the Trout in the Classroom Program and are given the opportunity to be a 
part of the trout release trip.  

Being a part of the Learning Partners Program during the years 2014-2018 provided us with a sharper and even 
more focused lens for studying how students learn in small groups. During our years with LPP, we partnered with 
Public School 321 and six other schools. We focused primarily on targeted small group instruction in reading and 
math as we looked closely at the level of transference within our teachers' instructional models. We reviewed our 
methods for checking for understanding in order to help us measure our students' levels of transference. . We 
engaged in various school visits to the host school (K321) and to the other partner schools. We looked closely at the 
impact of small groups during reading and we also looked at the impact of using data to inform targeted 
instruction. Teacher partnerships among the schools were formed and collaboratively they discussed and executed 
lessons. We gave each other meaningful feedback during this process. The work was alive and authentic, and 
provided us all with a lot of information on our practices, of planning and preparation. Our core group of LPP 
teachers disseminated throughout our school all of the information we studied and collected during our inquiry 
work within the LPP program. One vital piece of the work we did with K321 was to study the impact of their literacy 
tool; the conferring book on their students’ progress. Our teachers engaged in inquiry with the conferring book and 
after documenting their work, they were able to provide our staff with information and models of the conferring 
notebook. As the school year progressed the rich work that was being done within the LPP program was evident 
across all of our classrooms. Our teacher teams were implementing the best practices that were being shared by 
their peers, and our school was engaging in a lot more intra-visitations across the grades/classrooms. Our school

engaged in an LPP video that is now being shown city-wide in an effort to share the work that were we able to 
successfully accomplish with our host and partner schools. 

As we embark on the new 2018-2019 school year we will be deepening our focus on targeted, small group instruction. 
We will be utilizing the Danielson Framework, the DOK framework, Universal Design for Learning Framework, along 
with our membership in the Cahns Fellows Program, to provide us with the necessary tools and best practices to do 
this work. We will collectively engage in action research to study how we can use the vehicles of collaboration and 
trust to ensure that our students' work in small groups is having a positive impact on their progress. We will formulate 
lab-sites both in ELA and Mathematics and work with our grade teams as well as our Teachers College consultants, 
and our Math team to bring this work alive for our staff. We will utilize our Model Teachers and our subject 
facilitators to spread the knowledge and research across all of our classrooms. The work will be scaffold and 
differentiated to fit the needs of each group. All teachers will engage in this action research to enable us all to make 
the necessary shifts in our practice. Teachers will provide students with direct instruction in writing, using precise 
models, along with shared and interactive writing. They will closely monitor their practices and the feedback that is 
provided to students in order to collect data for our research. We will use these practices to study the patterns and 
trends as they are evident across each classroom and each grade.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Over the years we have looked closely at our student achievement trends. Close analysis of this continues reveal 
that there is a need to ensure that our Special Needs populations as well as our English Language Learners and the 
students in our bottom 1/3 and quadrants 1 and 2 were in need of an appropriate instructional model; one that 
would provide an entry point for learning to each of them. We discovered that there continues to be a need for a 
higher level of transference of knowledge between the teachers’ instruction and the students’ abilities. As a result 
of this revelation, we collectively came together and decided to use the Learning Partners Program model school-
wide in an effort to help us facilitate a more appropriate and supportive structure for our student population. We 
decided that we would begin by looking closely at the work we did with students during small group instruction; 
specifically in reading. We also selected a Special Needs class to conduct action research and inquiry around the 
volume of writing that was transferring from teacher to students. We looked at our planning of lesson; our 
execution of instruction; our pacing/time management; the way we gathered information/data on each student, 
and the impact of the data we were gathering. We utilized the information within the Danielson Framework 
components 1a, 1e, 3b, 3c, and 3d to help us provide professional development for our staff as we engaged in our 
cycles of inquiry around small group instruction. We used Danielson Framework component 4e to ensure that as 
the staff receive professional development, they used it to plan and execute appropriate differentiated lessons to 
meet the needs of each student. We analyzed our students’ progress or lack thereof against each benchmark to 
measure the level of student growth. We closely analyzed running records and on demand writing to also measure 
student growth.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school has made the most progress thus far in the areas of Strong Family-Community Ties and Trust. We are 
proficient in the areas of Collaborative Teachers, a Supportive Environment, and an Effective School Leadership. We 
are currently planning for and working to improve in the area of Rigorous Instruction as we continue to work on 
implementing and utilizing all of the strands within the common core standards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In 2017, our school was re branded as a STEAM school in an effort to provide more rigor across the entire school. We 
realized that our sub groups of students in specials needs, ELL, and African American boys, were in need of varied 
entry points into the instructional models. STEAM appeared to be the most popular framework since it provided the 
students with a rich curriculum for inquiry and exploration. Students would be given the opportunity to work 
alongside our science consultants, Omni Learn as well as with their science cluster teachers and their classroom 
teachers. They would be given the content knowledge and the lab experiences of engaging in many science 
experiences. Students would conduct real life experiments in the lab as they engage in discourse throughout the year. 

Providing our students with high order questions and the time to engage in rich discourse would be our priorities 
since these best practices would allow our children to become better thinkers as they explore various topics in 
science. Teachers would communicate with our consultants and align the work in an effort to provide our students 
with a comprehensive science curriculum and experience. Our technology teacher would infuse both technology and 
engineering into her instructional model. Students would engage in a variety of technology and engineering activities. 
Coding would be used to push our students' thinking and creativity. 

Our parents will be invited to share in many of our experiences. Our annual STEAM night would provide an 
environment of collaboration and family engagement to promote student growth as well as parent/family awareness. 
Our parent coordinator will continue to engage families in reading and literature on a weekly basis during the parent 
engagement sessions. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

1.  Commencing in September 2018 and continuing until June 2019, 100% of our teachers and students will engage 

in STEAM enriched activities within our STEAM lab. We will deepen our instructional core in order for our 
students to show a 10% increase in both Math and ELA by year end.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

1. Our research-based instructional programs , professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed to impact 
change would be:  

● Teachers will be provided with professional development in 
both English Language Arts and Mathematics. Teachers in Grades 
K-2 will engage in various cycles of learning in English Language 
Arts through our Teachers College Consultant. The teachers will 
study both reading and writing within labsites across each grade.  

Math will be targeted within our school and through our Math 
team, Online Resources and Teachers Manuals. Exemplars Online 
Resources and Engaged NY /Eureka Resources online. Math 
facilitators will attend professional development and provide 
enriched workshops for their colleagues.  

 

 

● We will partner with OMNI Learn in an effort to provide our 
students with a curriculum that is aligned to Science, Technology, 
Engineering, Art and Mathematics.  

 

* Engage in cycles of professional literature study so that the 
staff can benefit from the latest research and best practices in 
small group instruction, differentiation and rigor. We will study 
the book: DIY Literacy: Teaching Tools, Differentiation, Rigor and 
Independence, by Katie Roberts & Maggie Beattie Roberts. 
Reading Projects Reimagined, by Dan Feigelsen. Writing 
Strategies Book, by Jenn Seravallo.

* Our math facilitators will open up their classrooms as labsites 
and to help us deepen the work we will be engaging in with 
targeted instruction. Provide yearlong professional development 
for our teachers, utilizing various formats and cohorts so that the 
support is prescribed according to the teacher’s needs and so 
that the impact is real and transference is occurring for our staff 
and students.  

* Use our Model teachers, our Mentors and Subject Facilitators 
to provide support for those teachers in need of support.  

● Provide and foster an environment for intra-visitations across 
the school. Provide teachers with a protocol for meeting and for 
looking at student work so that their meetings and planning time 
are structured and meaningful for a larger impact on student 
progress. 

● Provide an appropriately structured planning calendar for the 
school so that meeting times are arranged, and predictable in an 
effort for better time management among all constituents

subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, STH):  

● Engaging in Action research/Data Inquiry to collect and study 
data in an effort to look at the impact of our planning and 
preparation practices across each grade; specifically within the 
Special Needs classrooms and within the ELL teacher classroom. 
Teachers will look closely at their lesson planning and execution 
along with their direct teaching and models being used to move 
student progress. 

● Provide opportunities for Grade Teams to create and use tool 
kits and other teacher resources to reteach and/or provide 
explicit models for the students. 

● Continue our work on targeted, small group instruction. As we 
establish lab-sites across the Lower and Upper Grades in an 
effort to share Best Practices among the staff.  

● Provide various parent workshops throughout the year for 
parents and caregivers. Provide parents with literature and 
surveys to be knowledgeable about the impact of the support we 
are providing. Continue providing our parents with our bi-
monthly curriculum letters. Continue providing parents with 
opportunities to be actively engaged in our school day via special 
school programs and activities. 

Provide a calendar of activities for parents during the Parent 
Engagement time.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In 2011, our school was selected nationally as one of the 10 schools to be inducted into the ASCD Whole Child 
Network of schools. Our extensive training over the past years has allowed us to study, implement and be driven by 
five Tenets which center around the belief that students should come to an environment where they are SAFE, 
HEALTHY, ENGAGED, SUPPORTED, and CHALLENGED. Our discovery of Brainpower and it's approach to providing 
students and families with support in the five tenets has allowed us to embrace it as we align these great works. We 
will use Brainpower to strengthen the work we continue to do within the five tenets. We have been able to 
continuously create an environment that is child centered, family oriented, and risk free for staff.  

Using the Tenets of SAFE, ENGAGED, SUPPORTED and CHALLENGED, we have been able to align our academic 
programs throughout the school so that they are in the best interest of our students. Our work is driven by the Tenets 
and allows us to incorporate a social and emotional program which is fundamental in helping us service Each child. 
Brain Power Approach, along with the Bucket Book Approach have allowed us to provide our students with a SAFE 
and Risk-Free environment; one in which they are able to thrive. Our entire staff has been trained in these two 
approaches and there is a common language which is spoken among us all. We understand that in order to be able to 
build a strong foundation for our students, we must first address the social and emotional needs of Each child. We 
have been able to provide support and enhance each of our classrooms through movement, counseling, conflict 
resolution and our Brain Power/Bucket Book common language. Our school has maintained a 0% on all student 
suspensions over the last four years. Our attendance rate has maintained around 96% each year, and our student 
progress across the entire school has been increasing in both ELA and Mathematics each year.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Commencing in September 2018 100% of our staff will engage in training and implementation of Brain Power in an

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Embed the Brainpower approach within our Whole Child tenets 
of healthy, safe, engaged, supported and challenged. Provide 
many opportunities for our Whole Child core committee to be 
trained in an effort to support this work. Allow the Whole Child 
team members to create various subcommittees to support each 
of the 5 tenets. Use this system to involve as many staff 
members as possible in an effort to align and incorporate our 
guidelines and expectations as we infuse Brainpower within the 
Tenets and throughout our school. 

Provide workshops and training for our parent body and our 
consultants in an effort to accumulate them to the new 
Brainpower approach and to the 5 Tenets and our social and 
emotional programs that are embedded within them. Also 
provide our parent body with workshops on how we are using a 
variety of teaching models and frameworks to provide prescribed 
instruction for all.  

Have our grade teams analyze the impact of Brainpower on their 
students' outcomes  

Use the Inquiry Team on each grade level to continue studying 
our students’ performance. Analyze the students’ trends and 
study the impact of our instructional models. A great focus will 
be given to data analysis across each grade. Parents will be kept 
abreast of the data via progress reports that will be given in-
between the time span for report cards.  

Family engagement will be mapped out on a yearly calendar and 
presented to parents at the beginning of the school year. 
Teacher teams will provide parents with memos, curriculum 
letters, data reports via progress reports, and workshops in an 
effort to keep them informed about student progress, etc. We 
will also provide parents with workshops on how we are aligning 
Brainpower within the five Tenets of the Whole Child approach 
we will show how the work is all intertwined and aligned in an 
effort for better communication and understanding among all 
constituencies.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and our school. This work is evident 
through the work they have engaged in all year long with the Learning Partners Program and the work they have done 
within their Teachers Team. Our teachers use instructional practices and strategies that are created from work that is 
customized during Grade Team and Vertical Team collaborations. Each Grade team of teachers is provided with two 
days during the week for planning. The teachers organize this work around our annual units of study, their daily 
lesson plans, and our student data (both hard and soft.) Our teachers work hard to meet the established student goals 
and to promote high levels of student engagement and inquiry. They provide coherent, appropriately aligned 
Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS)-based instruction that focuses primarily on small group instruction, which is 
targeted in order to provide our students with multiple points of entry for learning and achieving targeted goals for 
all.  

Teachers continue to create a safe environment using the indicators as outlined in our Safe Tenet under the Whole 
Child guidelines. These guidelines enable us to foster an environment that is responsive to students ’ varied needs. 
Teacher teams are able to tailor their work and focus on both the academic as well as the social and emotional areas 
for each student. Our goal is to provide students with high rigorous levels of engagement that are supportive for 
transference and a strong social and emotional structure where our Common Language is embedded and supported 
for all.  

Our Professional Development, including our work with the Learning Partners Program, which has now morphed into 
the Cahn Fellows has been an integral part of teacher planning. Our PD time is structured, purposeful and is driven by 
protocols which serve as the building blocks for our productivity. Professional development is provided by our various 
consultants, our Grade teams of teachers, our Subject Facilitators, our Support Staff and the administration. It takes 
place in cycles and covers topics inclusive enough to fit the needs of our Teacher Teams (grade and content level,) 
Para-Professionals and our Cluster Teachers. This year our teachers were placed in cohorts according to their needs 
for PD in ELA. A lot of the topics that were covered throughout the year dealt with the needs of the staff and the 
needs as they were outlined within our students’ outcomes/data and classroom practices. As we venture into the 
2018/19 school year, we intend to use the following to create our PD plan. We intend to: analyze our teachers End of 
year Advance reports, our school's report card, and our students' state and MOSL assessment results. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Each month we will check and monitor progress across all of our classrooms during our visits, and via our data profile 
spread sheet. We will meet during Grade Conferences and address various instructional patterns and trends. We will 
conduct instructional walk-throughs with our subject facilitators. These classrooms visits will allow us to view 
instruction, student engagement and find evidence of our five core foci (checking for understanding, conferring, small 
group work, use of rubrics and checklists, and higher order questions /discussions.) Our Grade Conferences will 
consist of a segment for looking at student work, as well as discussions about any social/emotional issues. Our parent 
collaboration will be monitored using attendance rosters from parent engagement sessions. Adjustments will be 
made across each area as needed. In February we will check our progress via student Mid-term data. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
In February our student Mid-terms will help us determine our progress. Mid-Year staff One-on-One chats will also

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As outlined in our Quality Review report and the results from our ASCD and AIR surveys, the administrative team at 
our school leads by example. There is a strong structure that is supportive and nurturing to all within our diverse 
school community. Our school follows the five Tenets (SAFE, HEALTHY, ENGAGED, SUPPORTED, And CHALLENGED) 
within the Whole Child Approach to set clear expectations and to lead the staff, students and their parents. According 
to our various findings, our leadership is: inclusive, opened to teacher/staff/parents input, and provides the school 
with a coherent program that continues to build rigorous and standard based curricula. This model is a work in 
progress and will continue to focus on creating and establishing a structure that supports multiple entry points of 
learning for all students. The administrative Team expects lessons to be challenging and engaging with precise models 
for students to follow. There is a clear expectation for all students to be engaged in high order thinking; providing the 
necessary scaffolds and support needed for success. 

An analysis of our students’ outcomes clearly indicates that there is a need for more professional development in the 
focus area of using student data to drive our small group instruction. There is also a need for more structured “Grand 
Conversations.” Our students are not engaging in enough Accountable Talk which is necessary to assess their 
understanding across each subject matter. Another finding was the school’s limited use of Universal Design for 
Learning which would allow each student to receive instruction in their learning modality. This practice would allow us 
to challenge all students, especially our students who perform way above their benchmarks. It would also allow us to 
provide a strong supportive instructional model for the other sub groups of students as we work to push them 
towards their full potential. Students would be provided with opportunities to engage in higher order thinking tasks 
and discussions. Finally it was revealed that our school needed a stronger system and structure for providing 
meaningful feedback to students across each grade. We found that this practice was evident in some of our 
classrooms; however there is a great need for consistency across the school. It is our goal to provide teachers with 
professional development in a school-wide system for looking at student work; using rubrics and checklists to inform 
students about clear expectations, and also providing students with concrete feedback to push their thinking about 
their work, in an effort to provide them with more success 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
1. By June 2019, teachers will show an increase in their MOTP ratings in components 3b (Questioning and Discussion) 
and 3d (Assessment) to ensure that there is a strong emphasis on the use of rubrics, checklists and meaningful teacher 
feedback.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our school works hard to provide a welcoming environment for families and it also takes advantage of the many 
community resources as a way to enrich the life of the entire school community. Using our five Tenets: SAFE, HEALTY, 
ENGAGED, SUPPORTED CHALLENGED we ensure that everyone who is a part of or who visits our school are with love 
and respect. We have opened our doors to our parents and the community so that they can become a part of the 
village that supports our children. Our Parent Coordinator is instrumental in reaching out to our parents and to our 
community at large. We provide parents with information through varied forms of communication. We utilize our 
school’s website which is maintained by the parents and our Parent Coordinator. Many teachers create and maintain 
their individual class websites. We send messages home via backpacks, and via our school messenger system. Our 
school year of activities is inclusive of many community businesses and institutions, and this is deliberately done to 
ensure that there is a rich School-wide Enrichment Program for all. Due to our family and community outreach, our 
numerous programs and our relatively new Dual Language Program in Spanish, our student population continues to 
grow and expand each year. Our students are seen skipping and running to school in the morning because they are 
happy and excited to be at school with their peers. Our suspension rate has been at a 0% for the last three years, and 
our attendance rate continues to hover around 97%. Families within the diverse school community are extremely 
involved and continue to “buy into” the community school. 

Our school continues to focus on being child centered and inclusive of all. We continue to take pride in our diverse 
community and in our highly active parent body. We believe in ensuring that students come prepared on a daily basis 
to be Safe, Healthy, Engaged, Supported and Challenged. We utilize the indicators within each of these Tenets to 
create a school culture that is conducive to learning, sportsmanship, team spirit, and one that is sustainable.  

Our efforts to communicate high expectations to all and to create programs that are innovative and enriched are 
evident through our Dual Language (Spanish) Program which services students in Grades Pre-K-Grade 4. Our extensive 
Arts/School-Wide Enrichment Program which provides various forms of art enrichment for our students. Our Social 
and Emotional Approach which is done through our partnership with Nurtured Heart. Our partnership with Playworks 
which provides our students with leadership development, support in organized play and conflict resolution, and 
finally though the strong partnerships we have with our parents, which can be seen through the numerous parent 
involvement committees and activities/events.  

Our monthly calendar is used as a tool to keep everyone aware of the numerous monthly events and opportunities to 
be involved in our school. Our parents are instrumental in conducting and spear-heading various activities across the 
school. There is a parent lead Spanish class that is taught by one of our native Spanish speaking parents. This class is 
used to bridge the gap between the two languages in our Dual language program. The goal is to provide parents with 
enough support in the Spanish language in an effort for them to be able to provide more support to their children at 
home. Our school’s Wellness Committee is co-chaired by a parent and our Guidance Counselor. This committee has 
been instrumental in providing the entire school with information and suggested guidelines for eating healthier foods 
and providing healthier snacks to our children. Our parents serve as class parents and meet on a monthly basis with 
the Parent Coordinator. This serves as great support to the students and the teachers. It also fosters an environment 
for collaboration among parents and staff. Our Garden Committee, Movie Night Committee and Fund Raising

committees are all facilitated by parents. Our parents can be seen volunteering throughout the entire school, and the 
Open Door Policy that serves as the Principal’s “Welcome Mat” has been instrumental in attracting our parents and 
families; allowing them to feel welcome, at home and a part of our school family. The principal’s events such as 
Breakfast and Dinner with the Principal are used as a way for our families to meet with the administrative staff and 
provide a risk free environment for discussing issues. Our SLT committee is also another place where parents are able 
to engage in the decision making for the school. Our parents serve as ambassadors to the school by serving on the 
School tour Committee where they actively assist in conducting school tours during the months of October –May. It is 
our goal to hire a community coordinator who will work collaboratively with our Parent Coordinator in an effort to 
provide a welcoming main office which serves as the parents “First Point of entry.” 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be an increase in the number of parents and community members who have a more in depth 
understanding of the five Whole Child tenets: healthy safe engaged supported and challenged. Our Core team will 
provide information at various parent functions in order to strengthen our School-wide awareness of The Whole Child.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K009, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

[The Teunis G. Bergen/P.S. 9] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At P.S.9 we use the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project assessments for literacy.  These assessments evaluate 
students knowledge of phonics, spelling patterns, sight words, reading levels, etc.  We also use assessments from Fundations 
and teacher created assessments for ELL's.   These assessments provide more detailed information about alphabet recognition 
(lower and upper case),  the ability to write the letters of the alphabet, knowledge of letter sounds and how many words a 
child knows in English.   These assessments are given in addition to the LAB-R test which is given to all potential ELL's.  We use 
all of the information from these assessments to group students and set goals for instruction for each child.       
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our ENL program based upon student progress and achievement.  We have found student 
portfolio's to be the best measure of student progress  since the NYSESLAT scores simply indicate whether or not a student is 
reading and writing on grade level.  Teacher's College running records with leveled reading passages allow us to track 
growth  in reading and  pinpoint the skills and lessons that students need.  We use teacher assessments to monitor concepts 
that were recently taught and we have found that these assessments measure student progress in more detail.  We also use 
portfolios to reflect authentic activities that students have been learning in the classroom and to provide a multidimensional 
perspective of student growth over time.  The NYSESLAT  is a good indicator of English language development and growth for 
the modalities of listening and speaking.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Data gathered from the NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, ELA and Math,  informal assessments and portfolios drives instruction for ELLs at 
P.S.9.   English language learners are pulled-outby the ENL teacher to work in small groups according to their level of English 
proficiency.  Differentiation if used to tailor insturction to each students individual needs.   At P.S.9,  we view the native 
language of English language learners as an educational asset that will ultimately support their English language success.  Our 
Response to Intervention process begins with an initial screening during registration when a student enters our school for the 
first time.  A Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is completed and parents and students are interviewed by the ENL 
teacher to get more information about the students' background and educational history.  This interview reveals factors that 
could influence the students' English language learning process such as first language proficiency, immigation patterns, 
socioeconomic status and culture.  Once it is determined that a student is an English Language Learner,  the NYSITELL  is 
administered to determine whether or not he/she requires the support of ENL services.  The data from this examination guides 
further assessments to develop a full profile of the student as a speaker, reader and writer.  Further assessments, both formal 
and informal, allow us to determine exactly what type of language and academic support a student requires and to create 
small groupings, accordingly.  Both our formal and informal assessments are on-going and this data drives the way that 
students are grouped for instruction.  Our student groupings are flexible, dynamic and constantly evolving based on 
assessment data.  ELL's are monitored to assess their progress on the continnum of learning language, litereacy skills and 
competencies and grade level benchmarks.  Both the classroom and ENL teacher monitor student progress in a systematic 
process to impact student achievement.  Data is gathered throughout the year from our technology program for ELL's (Imagine 
Learning English), running records and other informal assessments.  The partnership between  the classroom teacher and 
language support services is especially important for ELLs which have been determined to be at risk.  Together, we determine 
whether a student is struggling because of language acquistition or whether further testing is required to test for a learning 
disability (LD).  This prevents us from making the unfortunate error of placing English language learners (ELLs) into special 
education because  language acquisition has been misinterpreted as a learning or language disability. Intensive, targeted 
intervention is provided to support ELLs who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills and/or competencies 
measured.  At P.S.9, we only utilize strategies that are research-based with for entire student population including ELLs.        
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
This year we have 14 ELLs at the Entering level of English proficiency on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT.  Four of our ELLs are 
Emerging.  Two ELLs are Transitioning.  And finally, ten ELLs are Expanding. Therefore, nearly fifty percent of the English 
language learners at P.S.9 are beginners at learning the English language.  Consequently, oral language development, learning 
letters and numbers,  phonics and beginning reading and writing skills are major goals for most of our ELL's.   This year, we do 
not have many ELL's in the upper grades because they have tested out of ENL.  They have become Proficient in all modalities of 
the English language and no longer require ENL support.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 The English as a New Language (ENL) program at P.S. 9 is a freestanding pull out/push-in program with a total of 26 
students that receive services.  We do not have any intergrated or standalone ENL classess.  Students are grouped 
homogeneously  within grade bands and according to what skills the child needs to learn.  The teacher servicing this 
program, Ms. S. Hayward, is certified in teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.  Instruction is given 
exclusively in English using ENL methodology in order to foster proficiency and competency in the four modalities of 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We currently have 8  Dual Language Spanish classes on Pre-K through Third Grade.  Each class is taught by one teacher 
for the entire day.  The teachers for each class deliver instruction in English for half the day and Spanish for half the 
day.  Students in Dual Language classes are grouped heterogeneously, as they are at various levels of English and 
Spanish proficiency.  The principal, Ms. S. D’Avilar, and the assistant principal, Ms. E. Velazquez, provide supervisory 
support to all programs.     

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                                The ENL and Dual Language teachers ensure that mandated minutes are met in each instructional 
program.  In the ENL Program, English Language Learners (ELLs) from kindergarten to grade five are grouped according to their 
level of English language proficiency and grade level.   Entering (Beginner) and Emerging (Lower Intermediate) ELL’s receive 
360 minutes or 2 units of support each week.  Transitioning (Intermediate) and Expanding (Advanced) ELLs receive 180 
minutes or 1 unit of support each week.  Commanding (Proficient) ELLs must continue to receive services for 2 years and the 
required 90 minutes of instruction each week.  Home language arts support is offered through various activities  including a 
multilingual library, bilingual books and our technology program, 'Imagine Learning English', which instructs students in their 
native language.  ELL's in Dual Language classes also receive instruction as mandated by NYS CR Part 154.  Students in ENL and 
Dual Language receive ELA instruction each day in Reading and Writing blocks with classroom teachers and therefore they 
surpass the required 180 weekly minutes of ELA instruction.  Our Dual Language classes provide ELLSs with instruction in their 
home language of Spanish as classes are taught with a 1\2 day in English and a 1/2 day in Spanish.   All ELL's receive additional 
minutes and support in both English and their home language through our instructional technology program, 'Imagine 
Learning English', which is in addition to their regular instructional blocks.  The required minutes are reflected on the schedule 
for the ENL teacher and on class schedules for DL.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

                 In ENL, all of the content areas are explored through oral language development, Guided Reading, Shared Reading, 
Independent Reading, Word Study and Writing activities in English.  Materials used include Fundations letter and sound cards, 
Month-By-Month Phonics activities, magnetice letter tile tablets, guided reading books and books from leveled 
libraries.  Instruction includes songs, games and Total Physical Response (TPR) activites to facilitate learning the English 
language.  Students read a lot of informational texts as mandated by the Common Core Standards and these texts cover a lot 
of social studies, science and math content.   The ENL teacher also provides progress reports and assessments to classroom 
teachers of ELLs.  This maintains a level of consistency between the classroom and ENL instruction and integrates language and 
content.   Classroom teachers also differentiate for their English language learners.   Students also study in the content areas 
with their classroom teachers who employ visuals, gestures, slower speech and an emphasis on vocabulary to make content 
comprehensible to English language learners. The workshop model of the Balanced Literacy Program is used as an umbrella 
approach to foster a variety of ENL instructional strategies that promote communicative and linguistic competence and 
academic proficiency.  Such strategies include Cooperative Learning, which encourages interactive student participation and 
promotes social and academic language skills.  
      In Dual Language classes, the content areas are explored throughout the day through a variety of programs and 
curriculum.  The school utilizes 50 minute blocks across seven teaching periods per day.  Dual language teachers teach lessons 
in the content areas using both the English and Spanish languages.  For example, students will listen to a math lesson in English 
one day and then Spanish the next day.    
      Our instruction in ENL and Dual Language classrooms prepares students to meet the demands of Common Core 
Standards  by helping students to build a strong academic foundation in both the native and second languages.  Students are 
taught the most essential vocabulary and language functions to understand  tasks.  Teachers use visuals when introducing new 
words and concepts and build background knowledge.  All of this supports students academic achievement and the challenges 
of reading complex and informational text. 
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                Children are identified as English Language Learners using the New York State NYSITELL.  ELL's who are native Spanish 
speakers are also given the Spanish LAB to assess their abilities in their native language.  ELL's in our Dual Language classes are 
given regular assessments (teacher created) in both Spanish and English.    El Sistema de Observacion de la Lecto-escritura (EL 
SOL) will be used for further evaluation next year in Grades K - 3 in Dual Language classrooms.  This will measure Spanish 
bilingual student progress in literacy.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

At P.S.9 we differentiate instruction for our ELL subgroups.   One-on-one conferencing is a best practice used throughout the 
school to research each student and plan academically.  Students are grouped by ability and each group is taught a different 
lesson daily, according to the needs of each group of students.   
a.  Students with interrupted formal education (SIFE’s) are usually working far below grade level standards, even in their native 
languages.  Therefore, these students receive additional time and support beyond the mandated instructional minutes.  They 
also receive more support in the content areas since they tend to be lagging academically in all subjects.   
b.  Newcomers (in U.S. schools for less than 3 years) also receive additional time and support beyond the mandated 
instructional minutes.  Total Physical Response activities are used in order to accelerate language acquisition through the use 
of the kinesthetic sensory system. The Natural Approach in which meaningful context is stressed and students strive for 
communicative fluency is also used as an instructional strategy.  In addition, the Language Experience Approach is used 
allowing language to be acquired by relating it to the experiences and interests of students.   
c.  Guided Reading is an essential component in our literacy program and it is used extensively to support ELL's receiving 
service for 4 years and longer.   The structure of Guided Reading lessons offers ELL's the support that they need to explore and 
discuss a wide variety of topics and content while building vocabulary.   In addition, these students practice learned strategies 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

within texts on their reading level.  The Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach is used as a vehicle to provide 
content-based ENL instruction for students at the intermediate, advanced and transitional levels.  Each of these strategies is 
used as a tool to promote linguistic and academic excellence leading to the increase of State assessment scores for English 
Language Learners. 
d.    Currently, we do not have any long-term ELLs (completed 6+ years).  However, the school has support systems in place to 
help students who may need additional academic intervention.  Small group work and differentiation are best practices 
employed by teachers throughout the building to target each students individual needs.  We have also found that most long-
term ELLs requirea focused approach to  vocabulary development in order to comprehend complex texts.  Developing reading 
skills is especially important for long-term ELLs  to support academic achievement across all subject areas.  
e.  Former ELLs (in years 1 and 2 after testing proficient) are still monitored for academic success.  The ENL and classroom 
teachers continue to monitor progress and collaborate to support struggling students.  Former ELLs receive the mandated 
testing modifications on state exams.   Going forward new regulations require that former ELLs continue to receive services for 
at least 2 years following the school year in which a student is exited from ELL status (90 minutes per week).   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 At the present time, we do not have any students with disabilities who are English language learners at P.S. 9.  However, the 
school has several systems in place to investigate the needs of any ELL-SWD who enters the school.  These systems include 
Parent Orientations and  staff meetings that therapists, social workers, psychologists, special education and  ELL personnel 
attend.  Any ELL-SWD attending P.S.9 would receive instructional strategies and grade level materials appropriate for that 
student and according to their individual needs. We would also provide access to academic content areas and accelerate 
English language development using supports unique to that individual, if necessary.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  Though we do not currently have any ELL-SWDs at P.S.9, we are prepared for such a student to enter our school.  Our 
contingency plan is to form a team composed mainly of support staff to accommodate the needs of the child.  School 
personnel on this team would include teachers, social workers, school psychologists, nurses, speech, occupational and physical 
therapists.  Curriculum, instruction, and scheduling will be adjusted, if necessary, to meet the needs of such students.  The 
students' IEP is the guiding document for such a process.  Students in regular and special education are not segregated and 
students with disabilities would be fully integrated into the school community through flexible scheduling.  Our goal would be 
to keep the student in the least restrictive environment and to make this student feel as welcome and comfortable in our 
school as possible, while meeting their academic needs.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our technology program, 'Imagine Learning English!' is a great intervention for our English language learners.  Students are 
taught oral language, reading and writing skills across content areas in this program.  It also offers directions with native 
language support.  All students who are at the Entering, Emerging and Transitional levels of English proficiency d`o work in this 
program.  A license is purchased for each student so that they can be tracked individually with pre and post assessments for 
each skill that is taught.   Several staff members also provide support services to English language learners at P.S.9.  All Ells may 
receive academic intervention services in addition to ENL support.  For example,  first grade ELLs are a part of the 'Reading 
Recovery' and 'Reading Rescue' programs administered by staff members at the school.  ELLs are supported by classroom 
teachers through small group work throughout the day.    One of our main intervention programs  is a Saturday Academy to 
prepare ELL's for the NY state exams.  The Saturday Academy provides additional support and instruction in ELA and Math on 
alternating Saturdays.  We differentiate math instruction for ELL's by reading about math extensively, building strong math 
vocabularies and practicing math word problems.  As mandated by the Common Core Standards, students read a lot of 
informational text that supports social studies and science content.  The students in ENL are instructed in English but 
supported in their native language with Arabic and Bengali books from the teacher's library.   In addition to ENL services, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

support services include Academic Enrichment, Speech, Adaptive Physical Education, School Nurses, Psychologists, Social 
Workers, Counseling, Occupational and Physical Therapy.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 This upcoming school year, the ENL program will hold a multicultural book fair.  We hope to make a strong connection 
between parents of ELL's and our school community through this event.  The purpose of this book fair is to get both students 
and parents more excited about literacy.  Parents who have come from other countries will see books that reflect their culture, 
language and traditions.  We hope that they will purchase some of these books and be excited about reading them with their 
children.  The book fair will also feature leveled reading material alongside multicultural books.  This way, students have the 
opportunity to acquire an abundance of reading material on the appropriate reading levels for their homes.  For many 
students, this will be the beginning of a home library that we hope students and parents will continue to grow and build 
upon.      
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not have any programs or services being discontinued for ELL's.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 All ELL's are afforded equal access to both supplemental and after school programs. Supplemental services include Studio in A 
School, Guggenheim Arts, Ballroom Dancing, Playworks,  the Noel Pointer violin program, Swim for Life and Cookshop 
programs, to name a few.  After school programs include NYJTL (a tennis and homework support program) and NJ PACC which 
offers various sports and recreational activites after school.  We also have partnerships with various cultural institutions in our 
neighborhood including the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, the Brooklyn Public Library, Prospect Park and the Brooklyn 
Museum.  School calenders, letters and information regarding extracurricular activities are translated into each students' 
language to facilitate communication between home and school.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Instructional materials used to support ELL’s include materials for the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing project, Guided 
Reading materials, big books for Shared Reading, Fundations notebooks and letter tiles and Words Their Way activity 
books.  We use several technology programs including ‘Imagine Learning English’, ‘Rosetta Stone’ and ‘Math Blaster’.  "Imagine 
Learning English' measures and tracks students progress so that instruction is tailored to each students needs.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is provided in ENL and Dual Language classes through multicultural libraries which includes books in 
Bengali, Arabic and Spanish.  Students also use the technology program 'Imagine Learning English' which teaches students 
English while providing directions and support in each students' native language.  Students can work on the computer both in 
ENL class and in their classrooms.   In the Dual Language Program the native language is supported through the use of our 
50/50 Model taught by one teacher. For 50% of the day everyday the class is in the native language “mode” where only their 
native language is spoken.  All subjects taught during this time are taught in the native language. All materials used during this 
time are either in the native language or in both languages.  Everything throughout the learning environment is labeled in both 
languages. Everything labeled in English is labeled in blue and everything in the native language is labeled in red.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

  ELL's receiving required services are supported with resources that correspond to their ages and grade levels.     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Instructional materials used to support ELL’s include materials for the Teacher’s College Reading and Writing project, Guided 
Reading materials, big books for Shared Reading, Fundations notebooks and letter tiles and Words Their Way activity 
books.  We use several technology programs including ‘Imagine Learning English’, ‘Rosetta Stone’ and ‘Math Blaster’.  "Imagine 
Learning English' measures and tracks students progress so that instruction is tailored to each students needs.

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
P.S.9 holds Parent Orientations for incoming students.  There is also a special Open House and School Tour prior to the first day 
of school to assist newly enrolled ELL’s.  Parents and English language learners meet with the Parent Coordinator, teachers and 
staff.  ELL’s learn about the layout of the building and how to find their classrooms, the cafeteria and rest rooms. Parents 
receive information about translation services to assist them during the school year.  These activities help English language 
learners to adjust to their new school environment before the first day of school.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At P.S.9 we have a Spanish as a foreign language program that is offered to ELL's as well as the general student body.  
      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a. How much time (%) is the target language used for EP’s and ELL’s in each grade? 
In our Dual Language Program the target language (Spanish) is used 50% of the time for both the ELL’s 
and the EP students.  Fifty percent of each day is spoken and taught in the target language.  For example, 
a sample student schedule would show 2 weeks where Spanish is taught in the morning and English is 
taught in the afternoon.  Then for the next 2 weeks the languages would be reversed.  English is taught in 
the morning and Spanish is taught in the afternoon.  We do this for continuity so that children are 
immersed in a language and subject for a 2 week period before switching to the alternate 
language.  Teachers use Fountas and Pinelland Rigby PM leveled books to assess progress in reading.  We 
will begin to administer the ELE this year. 
  
b. How much of the instructional day are EP’s and ELL’s integrated? What content areas are taught 
separately? 
 Our Dual Language programs are taught by one teacher in each class for the full day.  Therefore EP’s and 
ELL’s are integrated 100% of the instructional day. All subject areas are taught simultaneously to EP’s and 
ELL’s followed by small group instruction to give additional support when necessary.  
  
c. How is language separated for instruction (time, subject, teacher, theme)? 
Language is integrated into each instructional day. With 50% of each day spoken in the target language 
and  50% of each day taught in English.   Language instruction is not separated but rather integrated into 
each day.  
  
d. What Dual Language model is used (side by side, self contained, other)? 
The Dual Language model used at P.S. 9 is a self-contained classroom with a 50/50 model. Fifty percent of 
the time the target language is utilized in the classroom and 50% of the time the English language is used 
in the classroom.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

  
e. Is emergent literacy taught in child’s native language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at 
the same time (simultaneous)?  
Since our Dual Language model is 50/50 and taught by one teacher in each classroom, emergent literacy 
is taught simultaneously in both languages. Students are taught literacy in their native language in 
conjunction with teaching literacy in English as well.      
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1.      All pedagogical staff participates in professional development several times a month.  The ENL Teacher participates in 
trainings offered to school staff across all subject areas to stay abreast of changes to the curriculum and  grade level 
benchmarks.  The ENL teacher is also supported by workshops through the Department of Educations Office of English 
Language Learners (OELL).  These workshops support the ENL teacher in all facets of  instruction from data analysis to 
designing curriculum.  The ENL and Dual Language teachers also attend NYSABE (New York State Association for Bilingual 
Education), an  Annual Conference which helps schools to formulate quality programs in bilingual education. 
2.      Classroom teachers of ELL’s receive professional development for English language learners through Teacher’s College, 
staff meetings, the New Teacher’s Breakfast and ‘Lunch n’ Learns’.   Topics to be addressed regarding English Language 
Learners include, but are not limited to, the identification process of ELLs, legal mandates in regard to services provided to ELLs 
in general and special education, assessment procedures for ELL’s, the role of the teacher and other support staff, strategies 
and methodologies to differentiate instruction and support ELL learners in the regular classroom setting, cultural awareness, 
and assessment procedures for ELLs.   Professional development also focuses on building in scaffolds to create access to the 
Common Core for ELLs. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
3.        The school counselor, Ms. K. Shaw, and parent coordinator, Ms. Jacob, assist ELL’s throughout the process as they 
transition from elementary to middle school.  They ensure that important documents are translated into the students’ home 
language and that translators are available, if needed. They also maintain an open-door policy if parents have questions or 
concerns.  The guidance counselor, Ms. Shaw,  has attended a UFT workshop that addressed helping all sub-groups, including 
ELLs go through the articulaton process.  
4.        We keep agendas and records of all professional developnent workshops attended by teachers.  Going forward, we 
will  increase the number of ELL-specific workshops held in-house so that these workshops represent 15% of our teachers total 
professional development.  The ENL teacher  will be attending calendar days at Teacher's College to meet the 50% goal of ELL-
specific professional development.   This information will be turn-keyed to staff, particularly teachers of ELLs, at the school.  All 
teachers, other than those who hold ESL and bilingual licenses, are required to attend 7.5 hours of ELL training (10 hours for 
special education teachers).  This workshop educates teachers about the unique make-up of the student population in NYC 
Public Schools.  It also introduces teachers to legal mandates, support services and instructional practices for English language 
learners. Teachers sign in and attendance is recorded at every PD session where teachers are trained about English language 
learners.  These attendance records are kept on file in the ENL office in our building.   The ENL teacher will keep records of ELL-
specific professional development that is provided to teachers both in-house and through Teacher's College.  The Assistant 
Prinicipal, Ms. E. Velazquez, meets monthly with DL teachers for topics ranging from scheduling to best practices and agendas 
are kept from these meetings.   DL and ENL teachers also attend the NYSABE and DL Symposium conferences.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S.9 will provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development 
prpogress, language proficiency assessment results and language development needs in the content areas.  These individual 
meetings will be planned on Tuesdays afternoons which are reserved for parent meetings in our building.  Meetings will be 
held with the ENL and Dual Language teachers.  Translators will be provided as necessary and meetings will be planned 
throughout the year so that parents have the opportunity to get several updates on their child's progress.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

At P.S.9, our parents( including parents of ELLs) are involved in our school community through volunteering, the Parent-
Teacher Association (PTA), and the School Leadership Team (SLT).  Both the PTA and the School Leadership Team meet once a 
month.  The PTA helps parents become involved in their children’s education, support school life and activities, share ideas and 
enrich their school community.   The SLT determines the structure for school-based planning and shared decision 
making.  These school-based organizations are open to all parent and guardians of children currently attending P.S.9, including 
parents of English language learners.  The Parent Coordinator holds several workshops each year to inform parents about 
topics like promotional policies, ELA testing, and strengthening literacy.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sandra D'avilar, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Coordinator? Yes/No  

 

(*Primary) 

 

   

 
* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Gathering data to access language preferences of the parent community for both written translation and oral 
interpretation begins with parents at registration. Both parents and children are interviewed and the Home 
Language Identification Survey (HLIS) is discussed during the registration process. The HLIS has 2 questions that 
parents must answer regarding their preference for written communication and oral communication with the 
school. This information is then entered by the school secretary into ATS and a report is generated for the Parent 
Coordinator. The Parent Coordinator uses this information to get documents translated into the parents preferred 
language. These documents include the Parent Handbook, the yearly school calendar, the monthly school 
calendar and many other documents.

language. These languages 
are Arabic, Bengali, 
Spanish and Haitian Creole.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.

meetings occur in September and 
throughout the school year. Parent-
teacher conferences occur in 
November and March. Curriculum 
Night occurs in September. We will 
also have individual meetings with 
parents of ELLs on Tuesdays 
throughout the year since Tuesday 
afternoons are designated for parent 
meetings throughout our building.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Welcome Poster's are at the main entrance of our school in various languages including the preferred languages 
indicated on Home Language Surveys completed by parents at registration. There are also Language ID Guides at the 
security desk and in our main office. Office staff use these guides, if necessary, to determine which language a parent 
speaks and to get a translator who speaks that language. Office staff will also call the ENL teacher to assist the parent 
and obtain translation assistance. We provide each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who 
require language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities and the Parents' 
Guide to Language Access. The Bill of Parent Right and Responsibilities explains their rights to translation and 
interpretation services. These documents are given to parents at registration if they indicate a preferred language 
other than English on the Home Language Survey. We keep translated versions of the documents available.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school uses the Parent Survey to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services.
