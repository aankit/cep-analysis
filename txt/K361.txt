Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 361 will educate each scholar by providing a positive, challenging and enriched learning environment that 
enables each student to become a lifelong learner and compassionate individuals who care about themselves and 
others.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Public School 361 is located in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. In September 2018 PS 361 will be a Pre K-5 
school, with the addition of the students and staff of PS 269.  

 

The many Community Based Organizations we partner with play an important role in the education pathways for our 
students. They share responsibility for helping our students develop socially, emotionally, and physically. PS 269 has 
had a long-standing partnership with the community-based organization, Camba/Beacon and Ps 361 will continue 
with this partnership. Camba’s Beacon Center at P.S. 361 serves a hub for families to access integrated and 
comprehensive services, including after-school for middle school youth, summer camp, summer jobs, and other 
educational and recreational activities. Our school is open to the community until evening on weekdays and on 
Saturdays. Evening and Saturday activities feature karate, chess, soccer, robotics, academic tutoring, English for 
Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) classes, as well as GED courses for adults. The Beacon Center at P.S. 361 also 
features a middle school club model where many of our prior students choose a basketball program, dance classes, 
media/technology workshops and other clubs that deepen learning by combining practice in academic and 
communication skills with popular activities. Our Beacon 269 program broadens the horizons of young people, 
strengthens their social, emotional and basic academic skills and provides a safe place where families can gain new 
skills together. We also partner with other organizations such as Chionesu Bakari, Asphalt Green, /New York Road 
Runners, h and The New York Founding Inc:Dental Services in effort to support our school’s ongoing focus on 
developing students' academic and personal behaviors so that they are equipped with learning habits and skills that 
support academic readiness and include non-cognitive, socio-emotional qualities that support resiliency, and 
college/career persistence. We strongly believe that community-based learning engages students for success and 
citizenship and accentuates the need for a rigorous and intentional effort to engage all students in learning. 

 

Character Education:  

At PS 361 our Core Values is at the heart of everything that we do at the school. Once a month a core value is 
highlighted through the book of the month, songs, conversations, writings and monthly assemblies.. Our core values 
include: Courage, Loyalty, Justice, Respect, Hope, Honesty, Responsibility and Love. This school year, we will also 
receive support from a Response to Intervention Coach. Response to Intervention integrates assessment and 
intervention within a multi‐level prevention system to maximize student achievement academically and socially.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

23% ENL- To support our ENL population, teachers of ENL students will be afforded learning opportunities on 
language acquisition. Scaffolds in Instruction will be aligned to the student's language acquisition stage. Effective 
researched based strategies will be used to support student learning. 
25% SWD- To support students with disabilities, scaffolds in instruction will incorporated in effort to meet students at 
their entry points. Vocabulary will be emphasized and the the teachers will incorporate the principles of UDL to 
support student achievement. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school community made the most progress in Rigorous Instruction. After analyzing, math observations and end of 
year conferences with our teachers, most felt that had grown in their understanding of math content knowledge. 
Teachers expressed their appreciation of slowing down the lessons, allowing for student think time and building their 
lessons from the knowledge of the students and not the next page in the "teacher's guide."  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

For the 2018-2019 school year our areas of focus include: 

*Assessment in Instruction-checks for understanding throughout the lesson 

*Continued enhancement of math content knowledge for both teachers and administrators 

*Language acquisition for ELL's and Early Childhood learners 

*All students will participate in a social emotional curriculum 

*Increased parent participation in at least two school community events

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Conduct a comprehensive assessment of your school’s academic program: 

Mathematics 

K-2 Students are engaged in curriculum from Eureka Math and Context for Learning. 3-5 students are in curriculum 
from Ready. New York State Math Exam results indicate: 34% performing on or above grade level. 

 

Literacy 

All students in K-5 follow the workshop model in reading and writing. Teachers in K-2 follow the Units of Study from 
Teacher's College and 3-5 follow the Units of the Ready Curriculum. New York State Math exam results indicate: 31% 
performing on or above grade level. 

Summarize your school's strengths relative to this framework element: 

*Data collection is systematic in all grades K-5. Adminstration and teachers have easy access to the data and are able 
to notice trends and patterns among classed and grades. 

*Curriculum is aligned to the standards, allowing entry points for all students, including ELL's and SWD's. 

*Observations conducted by adminstration is ongoing, both informal and formally. Feedback given to teachers are 
timely and actionable . 

What is the priority needs that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework Element: 

*Alignment of 2nd and 3rd grade curriculum ( F&P results from June 2018 indicate that 40% of the students were 
reading on grade level, receiving a level 3 or 4 or basic comprehension and a level 2 on beyond the text 
comprehension. Third Grade students who took the Iready Diagnostic Reading Exam scored well below average in 
phonemic awareness strand. Research is indicating a link between phonemic awareness and reading comprehension 
in harder to read texts.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

*Alignment of teaching points (learning objectives)with assessments with checks for understanding throughout the 
lesson using multiple strategies. 

*School wide focus from grades K-5 on CCSS Reading Strand (.6) Assessing how point of view shapes the content and 
style of text.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
School's strengths relative to this Framework Element 

1. Our school's strength as it relates to this framework is related to our Character Education. Each month every 
classroom celebrates the core value of the month with one class from each grade performing for their peers. Parents 
are excited to see their children perform in school and incorporate the core values into their daily lives at home.  

According to the 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot: 95% of parents say that they are satisfied with the education 
their child received this year, and 90% parents say that this school offers a wide enough variety of courses, 
extracurricular activities, and services to keep their child interested in school.  

Priority Needs 

2. According to the School Quality Snapshot only 62% teachers say that adults at this school teach students how to 
advocate for themselves. 

Policies, Practices and Structures: 

The monthly habits and core values are as follows:

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all students will participate in social emotional curriculum/core value and attendance assemblies to 
increase student engagement in school as evidenced by a 2.5% increase in school-wide attendance.  

Class Dojo 

By now all teachers should have their Class Dojo up and running. This means that students should be entered on to 
the system and parents should have already received the invitation to join your class.  

 

Core Values/Habits of Mind 

Each month we will have an assembly to celebrate the core value and habits of mind for the month (with the 
exception of September) September and October will be a joint assembly on November 1st and November 2nd. The 
assembly schedule will be as follows. On the first Thursday of the month, kindergarten assembly will be at 9:00 am 
and 1st grade at 10:00 am. On the following day, the first Friday of the month, Grades 2 and 3 will have their assembly 
at 9:00 am and Grades 4 and 5 at 10:00 am. 

 

The assembly is a celebration of the conclusion of the month in which students will receive a character award, perfect 
attendance awards, and class dojo awards (class with the highest points on the grade). Additionally, classes will be 
expected to perform a song, dance or skit that is based on the core value of the month. Each class must perform twice 
this school year. A schedule will be posted today in the main office where you can sign up for the month you would 
like to perform with your class. Selection is on a first come, first serve basis, which means that, once someone from 
your grade has chosen that month you can no longer select that month. Self-contained classes must perform with a 
larger class.  

 

Stanford Harmony 

We will continue to utilize Stanford Harmony school-wide. The schedule for utilizing the curriculum is as follows. 

Character Education will take place during the morning meeting block 8:25 am – 8:45 am. Two times a week utilize a 
meetup card and two times a week utilize a buddy up card. The remaining day can be used for you to address current 
issues in your classroom or another meet up card. 

Once a week you must conduct a Stanford Harmony Lesson provided in the curriculum. 

Kindergarten-Grade 2: Conduct a lesson once a week  

Grades 3-5: Conduct one lesson on Wednesday

Student Council 

Student council will be comprised of students from grades 2 to 5. The selection and election process will begin in 
October. An email will follow with additional information. 

 

Peer Mediation 

Current fifth and fourth grade students that have been trained as peer mediators. Peer mediation is conducted during 
the lunch periods only. A schedule will be posted in the cafeteria of when each student will be “on duty” as a peer 
mediator. Students who served as mediators last year will receive a refresher course during their lunch period and 
begin mediation in October. Third grade students will be selected and trained beginning in November. Third grade 
students will attend training once a week during their lunch period. They will be officially trained by Respect for all 
week in February. Third grade teachers please begin to think about who would make a good peer mediator from your 
class, you may consult with their previous teachers. 

 

Bullying Prevention Month (October) 

October is National Bullying Prevention Month. During this month teachers will be provided with cyber bullying 
lessons that must be conducted by October 19th. The curriculum that you must follow is attached. Please complete 
the lesson that is indicated below: 

Grade Lesson

5 Talking Safely Online 

 

Third, fourth and fifth grade students will be participating in our annual Stomp Out Bullying Walk classes may use 
their RCCP time in October to work with their class on bullying lessons and preparation for the walk. All teachers 
should work with their classes to make a chant, sing a song, make a slogan, rap, or present a dance. Please encourage 
your students to be creative, keeping in mind that they must also be appropriate. Feel free to have students create 
signs as well. At the end of the Anti-Bullying Walk one class will receive a reward. The reward will go to the class who 
displays a cohesive anti-bullying message. Some factors that will contribute to your class being chosen are originality, 
a cohesive message, and all members participating. Please submit your song, chant, or other creative idea to Ms. 
Pagan following the neighborhood walk. Even if your class does not receive a reward we would like to post your song 
or chant in the hallways to serve as a yearlong reminder that P.S. 361 has zero tolerance for bullies. Please be advised 
that in order for students to participate they must have their neighborhood walking slip. Ensure that you collect all of 
your neighborhood walking slips from your students.

88% of teachers say that teachers at this school work together to design instructional programs. The 2016-2017 
Quality Review indicator PS 361 received a good rating in the category of teacher development and evaluated. The 
2018-2019 school schedule allows for teachers to plan among the grade at three or more times during the week. 

Priority Needs: 

As the merger of two schools there will be opportunity for vertical teams, inquiry teams, enl teams that span across 
grades and subject areas. PS 361 will conduct an inquiry cyle based on the results of the ELA State Exam and analysis 
of student repsonses on the May 2018 Fountas and Pinnell Assessment.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs.

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 361 East Flatbush Early Childhood School, in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS 361 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

  # and types of certified teachers 


Begin description here:            
  
The program design will consist of groups as follows: Entering/Emerging grades 1-2, 
Entering/Emerging grades 3-5, Transitioning/ Expanding grades 1-2, Transitioning/Expanding 3-
5.  The program will begin in November 2018 and end in June 2019.  All students will meet on 
Saturday from 8:00am-12:00pm.  Students will meet for one session a week for a total of 25 
sessions over the course of the program.    Program attendance will be taken by participating 
teachers and maintained on file with the participating ENL teacher.  Parents will be notified of 
the program and updates with their child's attendance in the program via a letter that will be 
translated into parents preferred languages.   
The plan for this program is to provide targeted supplemental instruction in speaking, listening, 
reading and writing.  Students will receive supplemental instruction in an effort to target and 
improve specific modality proficiency per student for adequate yearly progress.  Instructional 
materials, distinct from those used for daily instruction, will be purchased.  Since this is the only 
Saturday program, we will need to hire a supervisor.  Language development will be taught 
using staff developed thematic ELA units aligned with the Common Core State Standards and 
scaffolds will be provided at each proficiency level to address the individual needs of the 
students in the program.  In addition, the units will include language objectives from purchased 
NYSESLAT preparation materials, such as "Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT" by 
Annatasio and Associates, Inc. and will target the four modalities of ENL instruction - listening, 
speaking, reading and writing.   
One certified ENL teacher will work with five common branch teachers to provide 
Speaking/Listening/Reading/Writing instruction. The ENL teacher will co-teach and co-plan 
with each of the common branch teachers. The ENL teacher will spend 60 minutes each Saturday 
after the program ends to plan and provide professional development on how to integrate ENL 
methodologies with content instruction.  

Part C: Professional Development  
Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as 
other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.

Begin description here:            
 
The rationale for professional learning for Title III program teachers is to acquaint them with the 
expectations and goals of the program and to meet through the duration of the twenty-five weeks 
to assess progress in language acquisition and apply alternative instructional methodologies as 
needed.

Part C: Professional Development  
Topic 1: Building a Positive Learning Environment Rationale: Building relationships, resources 
to be used in the ENL classroom and establishing routines. 
Topic 2: Scaffolding for English language Learners - Part I Rationale: To provide an overview of 
scaffolding methodologies for integrated instruction in all modalities of learning English as a 
New Language  
Topic 3: Teaching Beginning ELL Rationale: Key elements of curriculum and daily instruction 
for entering ELLs  
Topic 4: Scaffolding for English language Learners - Part II Rationale: To implement scaffolding 
of language instruction based on ENL proficiency level 
Topic 5: Teaching Intermediate ELL Rationale: To assess the successes of implemented 
scaffolding strategies based on ENL level of proficiency  
Topic 6: Teaching ELLs in the Content Areas Rationale: To mainstream the ELL students into 
classrooms through teaching social studies and science 
 
Topic 7: Using learning Games in the ENL Classroom - Part I Rationale: To scaffold teaching 
Tier II and Tier III vocabulary to classrooms with mixed language proficiency groups 
Topic 8: Using learning Games in the ENL Classroom - Part II Rationale: To assess the success 
of implementing Tier II and Tier III vocabulary to classrooms with mixed language proficiency 
groups 
All records (agendas, sign in sheets, handouts, etc.) will be maintained by the ENL teacher.  The 
professional learning provided to teachers is intended to enhance teacher practice, thereby 
improving student progress.  
 
  

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The early literacy skills of all PS 361students, including ELLs, are assessed through the Fountas & Pinnell Benchmark 
Assessment System which is administered formally four times per year.  Based on initial benchmark assessments given in 
September 2014, all of the first and second grade ELLs were performing below grade level standards in reading (level E for 
grade 1 and level I/J for grade 2).  Of the twenty- five kindergarten students enrolled at the time, 7 students knew no letters 
and sounds, 9 knew some letters and sounds and 8 knew all letters and sounds.  F&P Data for 2015-2016 is currently being 
collected.  Once collected and analyzed, this data will be utilized when planning lessons that coincide with the units of study in 
each curriculum area in an effort to provide differentiated instruction that addresses the needs of a wide range of learners by 
providing "multiple pathways" in the teaching and learning process.  Running records will be used to help identify the reading 
difficulties of individual students or monitor progress at regular intervals.  During small group reading instruction, students will

receive targeted instruction based on their area(s) of need (ie phonemic awareness, phonics, comprehension, vocabulary and 
fluency).          
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Program success is measured by the number of students meeting annual measurable achievement objectives for English 
Language Learners set forth by the State Education Department.  NYSESLAT data is reviewed to determine whether or not 
students are moving through the language proficiency levels.  The administrative cabinet and ENL staff look for trends in 
scores to determine how effective current instructional approaches are for our ELLs .  Data is utilized to assist teachers in 
making modifications to the core instructional program, as well as, plan targeted interventions for specific groups of students.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 361 implements the RtI framework.  When looking at data as a whole, the administrative cabinet (Principal, Assistant 
Principal, RtI Coordinator, Instructional Coach, AIS Provider) and ENL staff look at the the effectiveness of the core 
instructional programs for ELLs first.  If a large number of ELL students in a particular class or grade are making minimal 
progress and/or are underperforming, teachers focus on improving core instruction so that its targeted to student needs.  The 
instructional coach will provide in-class support to teachers, where necessary.  If most English Language Learners are making 
adequate progress in a class or grade, the next step would be to look at specific students of concern and tailor supports to 
address his/her needs (i.e. Tier 1, Tier 2 or 3 interventions).   Individual student progress is monitored by the classroom and 
ENL teachers over a period of time and a referral made to the RtI team, if necessary.            
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
NYSESLAT data patterns from the past two years indicate that students are making small gains in English language 
development.  Of the 33 students for which we currently have comparable NYSESLAT data, 5 students attained proficiency, 11 
students advanced one proficiency level, 15 maintained the same proficiency level and 2 students regressed.  It was noted that 
PS 361 students do not typically attain English language proficiency until they have received one or more years of ENL 
service.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

PS 361 offers two organizational models of English Language instruction for English Language Learners at this time: 
Kindergarten   
and grade one ELLs are grouped together by grade.  Grade two students are heterogeneously grouped (mixed 
proficiency levels)  
in regular classroom settings.  All ENL students receive the required units of study in stand alone ENL and integrated 
ENL instruction  
based on their proficiency levels as outlined in CR Part 154-2.  Special education students are placed in programs as 
per their  
Individualized Education Plan (IEP) recommendations and receive ENL services via a pull-out model.            

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              PS 361 will continue to need at least two licensed ENL teachers on staff full time to ensure that the amount of 
ENL instruction students 
receive is aligned with the CR Part 154 requirements for English Language Learners.  Students who perform at the entering and 
emerging levels of proficiency on the NYSITELL or NYSESLAT receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction and 180 minutes of 
ENL/ELA instruction weekly, totaling 360 minutes of instruction.  Students who are at the transitioning and expanding level 
receive 180 minutes of ENL/ELA instruction weekly.  Students who perform at the commanding (proficient) level will continue 
to receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL in ELA or a content area for an additional two years.         
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Students in our ENL programs receive all content area instruction in English with home language support.  Home 
language support is given via home language libraries/books on tape, technology enrichments - use of Imagine Learning 
English program, the buddy system and/or a bank of interpretors (staff) called upon to support students.  Units of study in all 
curricular areas are developed to ensure that all students, including ELLs are actively engaged in standards-based academic 
instruction with a focus on developing the four modalities of English acquisition (listening/speaking and reading/writing).   In 
order to maximize English language acquisition for ELLs, the ENL and classroom teachers work closely to deliver literacy 
instruction, as well as, tailor instruction to meet the needs of ELLs.  Teachers teach content in strategic ways that make 
concepts comprehensible while promoting student's academic English language development (i.e. slower speech, clear 
enunciation, use of visuals or demonstrations, use of realia or manipulatives, targeted vocabulary development, connections 
to student experiences and use of supplementary materials).  Common weekly preparation time is scheduled for general 
education teachers of ELLs with ENL teachers for collaborative lesson planning.                      
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                PS 361 is a Pre-K to 2 school and students do not take assessments in their home language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

PS 361 does not have SIFE students or long-term ELLs. 
As a Pre-K through grade 2 school, PS 361 only has ELLs who have been in US schools less than three years (newcomers), ELLs  
receiving service 4 to 6 years (if an ELL has been heldover) and former ELLs (in years 1 and 2 after testing proficient).  To meet  
the needs of these ELLs, teachers modify instruction based on their knowledge of the students in their classrooms.  Using the  
curriculum maps as a guide, teachers plan lessons and design clasroom learning experiences that are responsive to the wide 
range  
of student needs in the classroom. The progress of former ELLs is monitored closely by RtI team members and they are 
provided with  
90 minutes of study per week of Integrated ENL or other approved Former ELL services for an additional two years, as per CR 
Part 
154.2.  Additional support can be invitation to participate in afterschool, AIS, etc.      
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELLs, including ELLs with disabilities, utilize the same grade-level materials as their general education counterparts 
to  
allow for equitable access to academic content areas.  A master schedule has been created to promote collaborative learning  
among staff; time has been created for teachers of ELLs to meet weekly with teachers on their grade (special educators, 
teachers of  
ELLs and general education teachers), as well as, weekly with other ENL teachers.  While planning individual units of study, 
specific  
instructional strategies and activities are decided upon to provide for multiple entry points for students at varying levels within 
a  
grade (i.e. grouping models, using multiple intelligences/learning styles, teaching metacognitive strategies).       
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Special education students are placed in programs as per their Individualized Education Plan (IEP)  
recommendations and receive ENL services via the pull-out model.  ENL teachers are given copies of IEPs for ELL-SWDs so they 
can  
provide ENL instruction that is geared not only in attaining English proficiency, but assisting students in achieving their IEP 
goals.   
Whenever possible, students with disabilities are flexibly programmed to receive ENL services with their general education 
peers.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
PS 361 offers the following intervention services for ELLs in all subgroups: Title III Afterschool Program (Literacy) and Academic 
Intervention Services (Literacy and Math).  All instructional services are offered in English.  Imagine Learning English, a 
computer assisted program, is utilized by ELLs during the school day.  Language support is provided in two languages (home 
language and English) an slowly transitions to only English.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Common weekly preparation time will be scheduled for general education teachers of ELLs with ENL teachers to allow 
for  collaborative lesson planning.                        
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

In an effort to further promote collaborative learning between all staff, decrease the amount of time students are taken out of 
their classrooms and decrease the amount of instructional time lost as students travel between classrooms, we will promote 
push-in and self-contained models as opposed to pull-out programs to the best extent we can. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
In addition to mandated ENL services, ELLs are invited to participate in Academic Intervention servces in Literacy and Math 
(during the school day) when needed.  Students are chosen when they are not meeting Fountas & Pinnell bechmark levels 
(literacy) or attaining mastery of concepts on unit assessments (math) for their grade.  All ELLs (grades 1 & 2) are invited to 
paricipate in the Title III Extended Day program.  Invitation letters are sent home to parents of students inviting them to 
participate in the programs named above.  ELLs are also invited to participate in the extracurricular activities offered: chorus, 
violin, band, and visual arts.  Students are invited to participate if they demonstrate a natural affinity to the specific art area (in 
class sessions or during an "audition") or express a strong interest in it.  ELLs are also included in the two Community Based 
Organization afterschool education programs housed at PS 361: CAMBA and HELP via parent request.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) materials are the primary vehicle for literacy instruction for all 
students, including ELLs.  Classroom teachers make necessary accomodations to program materials for ELLs who require it.  All 
classrooms are equipped with SMARTBoards and desktops or laptops ans iPads are available for use in kindergarten.  Students 
are engaged in read alouds, shared and guided reading/writing and computer assisted instruction in literacy.  Our ENL teacher 
collaborates with special education classroom teachers to plan her lessons so that students are introduced to concepts the 
week before they are introduced in their regular classroom; instruction in all grades is paralleled to the classroom 
instruction.  MONDO's Let's Talk About It! supports our efforts in increasing oral language development in students while 
linking oral language instruction to reading and writing instruction.  Engageny materials are utilized to support math 
instruction.             
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is given via home language libraries, technology enrichments,  the buddy system and/or support from 
a staff member who can translate and interpret for the student.  We have begun to create glossaries and word walls with 
home language translations in the classrooms of ELLs.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required support and resource materials utilized correspond to our ELLs' ages and grade levels; scaffolding of lessons is 
provided based on student language proficiency levels.  Students in grades K -2 are grouped with students of the same 
age/grade; special education students in grades K, 1 & 2 are grouped together.             
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) materials are the primary vehicle for literacy instruction for all 
students, including ELLs.  Classroom teachers make necessary accomodations to program materials for ELLs who require it.  All 
classrooms are equipped with SMARTBoards and desktops or laptops ans iPads are available for use in kindergarten.  Students 
are engaged in read alouds, shared and guided reading/writing and computer assisted instruction in literacy.  Our ENL teacher 
collaborates with special education classroom teachers to plan her lessons so that students are introduced to concepts the 
week before they are introduced in their regular classroom; instruction in all grades is paralleled to the classroom 
instruction.  MONDO's Let's Talk About It! supports our efforts in increasing oral language development in students while 
linking oral language instruction to reading and writing instruction.  Engageny materials are utilized to support math 
instruction.             
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

In an effort to assist newly enrolled ELL students before the beginning of the school year, parents and students are invited to 
tour the school building and students are assigned a buddy (Parent Coordinator/member of the School Assessment Team) to 
check in on them.            
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

As a Pre-K to 2 school, language electives are not offered.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The PS 361 Professional Development focus for 2015-2016 for all teachers, including teachers of ELLs, is Assessment in 
Instruction.  The plan will continue to support the teachers who work with ELLs during the school day, as well as, in the Title III 
programs.  During weekly curriculum planning meetings, informal and formal observations, administrators offer concrete 
suggestions to teachers regarding lesson modifications to increase comprehensible input for ELLs in their classes while 
maintaining rigor necessary for students to meet Common Core Learning Standards.  All teachers meet weekly on Monday 
afternooons for professional learning and on Tuesday afternoons for Inquiry work.  As prescribed by CR Part 80, at least 15% of 
the professional learning sessions in 2015-2016 will be dedicated to training general education teachers in language 
acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instructon for 
ELLs and 50% of professional learning sessions for teachers of ELLs will be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with 
core content area instruction, including focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content 
instruction for ELLs.  A professional learning session will be scheduled to focus specifically on the translation and interpretation 
services available to staff.  All teachers and staff have received a copy of the "I Speak…" card which includes the phone number 
for over-the-phone interpretation.  Teachers of ELLs will continue to be invited to attend related professional development 
opportunities offered through the Department for Educators of English Language Learners (DELL) program and the district 
throughout the school year as they relate to the needs of our staff and/or ELL population.

The administrators of PS 361 and PS 269 (our feeder school) dialogue to create a shared curricular vision (vertical 
alignment).  Grade two teachers are given the opportunity to collaborate with grade three teachers during the school year 
during professional learning sessions and PS 361 teachers play an integral role in the reorganization of grade two students 
going to PS 269 for grade three (ie grade three classes are made at PS 361).  To support families in the transition to grade 
three, PS 269 typically holds an Open House each Spring for incoming parents.   
The professional development plan for PS 361 for 2015-2016 will be designed to include providing professional development 
to  
all teachers in an effort to best meet the needs of our students and to satisfy CR Part 154.2 requirements.  ENL teachers will 
be  
invited to participate in PD opportunities offered through the district throughout the year.  ELL teachers will turnkey 
information to  
general and special education education staff at weekly Monday professional learning community sessions.  
Records are maintained in a binder entitled Professional Learning Communities.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Teachers of ELLs will schedule appointments to meet with parents/guardians of ELLs to discuss the goals of the program, their 
child's language development progress, their child's English language proficiency assessment results and language 
development needs in all content areas on Tuesday afternoons from 2:45-3:25pm (as per collective bargaining agreement) 
throughout the school year.  Interpreters/translators will be utilized in the language the parent's preferred language; the DOE 
Translation and Interpretation Unit will be called upon, when necessary.   Parent attendance at meetings will be documented 
on student cumulative record cards under the "Significant Interviews" section.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

It is our belief that parents play an integral role in supporting their child's learning.  All parents, including parents of ELLs, are 
encouraged to be actively involved in their child's education.  With this in mind, PS 361 has provided school folders for regular 
written communication between teacher and the home.  In addition to weekly homework sheets, monthly newsletters are 
sent home for each grade.  Written progress reports are given three times a year in addition to report cards to keep parents 
informed of their progress as well.  Parents are invited to become school volunteers via the Learning Leaders program.  Our bi-

activities.  Town Hall meetings are held afterwards with the administration and parents.  Materials are provided and training is 
given to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement levels at various workshops held throughout the 
school year (i.e. Family Literacy, Family Math).  Workshops specifically geared for parents of ELLs are planned.  Topics may 
include, but are not limited to: stages of English language acquisition, NYSESLAT preparation.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tiffany Frazier, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Written and oral language preference data is collected via the following forms and entered by school staff in ATS: 
Student Registration Form, Home Language Identification Form, Emergency Contact Card. Parents/guardians 
complete a Home Language Identification Survey (which is translated into the respective home languages parents 
speak/understand) for each newly admitted student during the registration process, along with a Student 
Registration Form. Information from these documents is helpful in determining written translation and oral 
interpretation needs for particular families. We also conduct an assessment of written translation and oral 
interpretation needs through the information given on their child's Emergency Contact Card (translated versions 
are available), which is given to all parents at the beginning of every school year. Informal interviews of parents 
also ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can 
understand. Additional oral interpretation needs are determined by requests for oral interpretation at our Parent 
Orientation and Parent Teacher Conferences by teachers and parents, information received from our ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

teachers, and observation of parents of ELLs at our parent functions. Throughout the year, the Language Access 
Coordinator(s) generate and review up-to-date ATS reports which indicate preferred languages for parents in our 
school community.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

faculty meeting in September. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

A multi-lingual welcome poster will be posted near the main entrance of PS 361 and in a prominent location at the 
mini-building. Parents whose primary language is a covered language and who require language assistance services 
will be provided with written notification of their rights (Parents' Bill of Rights) regarding translation and 
interpretation services and instructions on how to obtain these services. All parents will be provided with the Expect 
Success Guide. A sign wil be posted near the primary entrance to the school indicating the room where a copy of the 
notice for parents regarding language assistance services can be obtained to ensure that parents are not prevented 
from reaching the office due to language barriers. The Language ID Guide will be kept at each security desk and in the

Feedback on the quality and availability of language assistance services provided to parents will be gathered via a 
survey distributed in May of each school year. Survey information will be reviewed with School Leadership Team 
members in June and adjustments made for the following school year, if warranted.
