Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Jacob H. Schiff PS 192's core beliefs establish a learning environment where students, in partnership with families and 
the community, reach their potential as they acquire the knowledge needed to contribute to a changing society.  

We provide an inclusive, cooperative, and resourceful atmosphere that will nurture the continuing social, emotional 
and academic development. All children are respected and engaged in challenging curricula which motivates them to 
realize their potential as active, life-long learners.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

Our vision is to ensure that all students acquire the essential knowledge and skills that they need to become 
independent thinkers, and to become active participants and contributors in their role as students and as members of 
society.  
 
Our 2018-2019 Instructional Focus is Using Assessment to Inform Instruction. If at PS 192, we successfully utilize 
assessments to inform instruction, then the quality of teaching will increase and promote academic achievement. We 
define instructional focus as a common goal that inspires school-wide collaboration, create a common language and 
directly impact teacher practice and student performance. 
 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 192 is proud to have become a UFT Community Learning School during the 2017-2018 school year. We look 
forward to expanding our work with our Community School Director and expand to provide additional opportunities 
to support the academic, physical, social-emotional growth of our students with our families. The Community 
Learning School Initiative seeks and fosters excellence in student performance through a collaborative community 
approach. Through public and private partnerships, the CLS transforms a school building into a true community hub. 
This structure includes: On-site community school director (CSD), creates a culture of collaboration, provides holistic 
programs & services and integrates professional support. As a CLS, a needs assessment is completed from different 
community constituents, including students, families and staff. Through this needs assessment, the school identified 
four main priorities to frame our collaborations and partnerships for the year:  

1. Literacy Support  

2. Physical Wellness and Education 

3. Social Emotional Wellness 

4. Family Engagement  

Our CSD and Advisory Board is on the process of working on acquiring additional partnerships to benefit our 
community.  

The school has several partnerships to support our quest in developing the whole child, which include:  

1. Heritage School-Based Health Clinic - a full service health provider that services students in grades pre-K-5. 

2. Mt. Sinai-St. Luke's Hospital Child and Family Institute - provides mental health services to children and families  

in need of assistance.  

3. NYC Mission Society - an OST after-school program that services P.S. 192 students grades K-5. 

4. Creative Arts Works - provides an arts-based and integrated curriculum during the school day. Professional  

teaching artists collaborate with school teaching staff to help provide for arts education and align lesson  

planning with core curriculum state standards. 

5. Lincoln Center – an after school program that integrates the arts by providing teaching artists in the school to work 
on curriculum based units in music, theatre and visual arts 

6. Cook Shop - a program offered to students and parents that encourages healthy eating habits. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

7. America Scores- an after school program integrating soccer, poetry and service learning.  

8-Snack and Story Time- a program that provides volunteers to participate in read-alouds and snack-time 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school population is comprised of 86% Hispanics, 9.5% African-American, 4% Whites, 1% American 
Indian/Asian/Alaskan. The student body includes 30% English Language Learners (ELLs) and 19% Students With 
Disabilities (SWD). Boys and girls each account for 50% of our school population equally.  

The school has several academic programs and intervention initiatives to support our students with achieving 
academic proficiency, which include: 

  MYON - an online reading resource/program that provides an extensive library of differentiated books at 29 

levels of difficulty that affords students with personalized opportunities to practice and grow their reading 
skills at school, at home, or on the go. 

  GRAIR - Guided Reading and Independent Reading learning opportunities for students in grades K-5. 
  Guided Math- Guided Math and fluency support learning opportunities for students in grades 3-5.  
 
  Accelerated Reader 360 - provides K-5 students with learning opportunities to engage in independent and 

IReady- Use of iReady diagnostic assessments and programming to differentiate for students 

close reading activities and work toward individualized reading goals. 

  Dreambox Math - a game based instructional software program designed to boost math comprehension, 

proficiency, and problem solving skills through visual learning. 

  ELA&Math Tutoring- additional in-class academic support provided to students in reading and mathematics  
  After-School and Saturday Instructional Academy - an after-school program providing students with 

additional instruction and support in the areas of ELA and Mathematics. 

  Title III ELL Academy - an after-school program providing ELL students with additional instruction and support 

focused on increasing our students' English language acquisition skills and proficiency. 

Through the triangulation of our data sources, we have created an action plan to best meet the needs of our different 
student populations through the use of the academic programs and intervention initiatives listed above.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our school continues to make significant progress in the area of "Supportive Environment" The school establishes a 
classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Students feel respected, comfortable and challenged to take risks within their learning.  

A key area for focus continues to be "Rigorous Instruction". Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and 
aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Upon triangulation of our multiple data sources, including student performance on the NYS Math Assessment, 
Beginning of Year data from GoMath pre-requisite skills assessment, teacher observations and other formal/informal 
data sources, we have identified the needs of our school community in this area. To support the work of this goal, the 
school Many sources (i.e., Quality Review, School Quality Snapshot, Measures of Leadership Practice, NYS School 
Report Card, etc.) have cited that the school curriculum is well aligned to the CCLS and provides standards-based 
learning. Our priority this school year, is to improve upon teacher practice so teachers can intellectually engage 
students in learning activities that promote student thinking and student self-reflection. In addition, we will ensure 
that students use rubrics/checklists as self-assessment or self-monitoring tools to guide them in critiquing their own 
work to make necessary improvements that lead to producing better quality and more accurate work products/pieces 
of work.  

Students actively engage in daily problem solving, integrating discourse and accountable talk through the use of 
CUBES, sentence stems, think-ink-pair-share and TAG protocols.  

In review of the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, PS 192 scored a 3.13 in the area of Rigorous Instruction, which is 
less than than the district and city average:  

  59% of teachers say that students respond to challenging test questions 
  55% of teachers say that students respond to challenging questions in class  
  90% of math/science teachers say that they have the resources to focus deeply on the concepts emphasized 
in the standards to help students build strong foundations for learning; have resources to develop students' 
conceptual understanding, procedural fluency and their ability to apply math in context.  

In review of student data from the NYS Math Assessment, we determined that 38% of students currently in grades 4 
and 5 mastered grade level standards demonstrated through Level 3 or 4 scores, which identifies 62% of students are 
currently scoring in Levels 1 and 2, which equates to 74 current students who were assessed last year.  

Instructional and teacher teams reviewed the June Instructional Report and GoMath Beginning of Year Data to 
identify areas of focus to revise instructional pacing and provide resources/scaffolds to support student learning. With 
the support of instructional coaches, teacher teams review data and create a 6-week short-term goal with action plan, 
as follows:  

  By the end of November 2018, 85% of kindergarten students will fluently count, write and model numbers 0-

10.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

  By the end of November 2018, 85% of 1st grade students will fluently add numbers to 10 using 2 different 

strategies.  

  By the end of November 2018, 85% of 2nd grade students will represent numbers to 1,000 using base ten 

blocks, expanded form and word form. 

  By the end of November 2018, 85% of 3rd grade students will fluently add and subtract within 1,000.  
  By the end of November 2018, 85% of 4th grade students will fluently multiply 1-digit numbers.  
  By the end of November 2018, 85% of 5th graders will fluently multiply multi-digit numbers (including 

2digitx2digit and up to 4-digitx1digit).  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

Teachers, instructional coaches and our new Community School Director will host regular workshops on different 
elements of the curriculum and Common Core expectations on Tuesday afternoons during our parental engagement 
period. Our Parent Coordinator hosts regular workshops with the help of our community partners to support our 
families and provide additional resources through newsletters. In addition, we host family Engagement Nights to 
reinforce what is being taught in the classroom and provide enrichment activities that can be used at home.  

Information will be shared with parents in different formats, including through a monthly calendar and flyers for each 
event (distributed by parent volunteers at arrival/dismissal and backpacked home), school messenger (phone 
calls/text messages/emails), through Class Dojo and through our school website.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Upon triangulation of our multiple data sources, including student performance on the NYS ELA Assessment, 
Beginning of Year Writing Assessment & Fountas and Pinnell Running records, as well as teacher observations and 
other formal/informal data sources, we have identified the needs of our school community in this area.  

To support the work of this goal, the school Many sources (i.e., Quality Review, School Quality Snapshot, Measures of 
Leadership Practice, NYS School Report Card, etc.) have cited that the school curriculum is well aligned to the CCLS 
and provides standards-based learning. Our priority this school year, is to improve upon teacher practice so teachers 
can intellectually engage students in learning activities that promote student thinking and student self-reflection. In 
addition, we will ensure that students use rubrics/checklists as self-assessment or self-monitoring tools to guide them 
in critiquing their own work to make necessary improvements that lead to producing better quality and more 
accurate work products/pieces of work. 

Students actively engage in daily phonics instruction, guided reading and accountable talk through the use of 
sentence stems, think-ink-pair-share and TAG protocols. 

In review of the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, PS 192 scored a 3.13 in the area of Rigorous Instruction, which is 
less than the district and city average: 

* 90% of social studies/science/ELA teachers say that they had the resources to include opportunities for building 
students' knowledge through content-rich non-fiction. 

* 100% of social studies/science/ELA teachers say that they had the resources to include opportunities for reading 
and writing experiences grounded in evidence from text, both literary and informational. 

* 100% of social studies/science/ELA teachers say that they had the resources to include opportunities for students to 
interact with complex grade-level text. 

* 100% of social studies/science/ELA teachers say that they had the resources to include opportunities for students to 
interact with academic language. 

* 59% of teachers say that students use data or text references to support their ideas. 

In review of student data from the NYS ELA Assessment, we determined that 31% of students currently in grades 4 
and 5 mastered grade level standards demonstrated through Level 3 or 4 scores. Instructional and teacher teams 
reviewed the June Instructional Report , Fountas and Pinnell reading levels and Ready Beginning of Year Data to 
identify areas of focus to revise instructional pacing and provide resources/scaffolds to support student learning.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          22 

 

With the support of instructional coaches, teacher teams review data and create a 6-week short-term goal with action 
plan, as follows: 

* By the end of December 2018, 85% of Kindergarten to Second Grade students will grow 2 reading levels as evident 
by F&P running records. 

* By the end of December 2018, 85% of Third to Fifth Grade students will grow 1 reading level as evident by F&P 
running records. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In review of the Teacher Performance Overview Report in Advance, we identified that 86% of teachers overall are 
rated Highly Effective or Effective as a combination with their MOTP and MOSL score.  

When MOTP scores are isolated, we have 0% of teachers who are rated Highly Effective and 62% of teachers who are 
rated Effective. We currently have 3 teachers who are were rated Developing and are receiving guided support 
through a TIP.  

In reviewing teacher performance in Domain 3, specifically 3b: using questioning and discussion techniques; 3c: 
engaging students in learning; and 3d: using assessment in instruction, we identified the following:  

  Overall, our teacher average in 3b: using questioning and discussion techniques is 2.43.  
  Overall, our teacher average in 3c: engaging students in learning is 2.62.  
  Overall, our teacher average in 3d: using assessment in instruction is 2.62.  

In formal and informal observations of classroom teaching and student work, we have identified the importance of 
creating a student-centered classroom, emphasizing the importance of discourse, questioning and student reflection, 
aligned to our district priorities.  

We recognize that frequent, effective, actionable feedback to teachers is a necessary component to promote and 
ensure successful teaching and learning and is an effective manner in which to communicate clear and high 
expectations for successful teaching and learning.  

Our focus, to provide frequent, meaningful, and actionable feedback with recommendations for instructional next 
steps for teachers will be a valuable asset to teaching staff and directly impact the instruction our students receive.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Looking at the most recent School Survey Report we saw that: 

  93% of parents communicated with their child’s teacher about their performance.  
  73% of families say that they have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their school. 
  98% of families say that they are greeted warmly when they call or visit the school  
  98% of families say that they are well-informed by the communications they receive from the school  

While this represents a high percentage of positive responses, we strive to increase the number and percentage of 
parents who “strongly agree” to 100%.  

In all, there were 88% of parents (301 total) that submitted the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey.  

These statistics indicate that there is much that can and should be done to increase and strengthen our school’s ties 
with our students’ families. This school year the school will continue forward to improve on its quest to engage 
parents on all aspects of our school community. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be an increase from in parent participation in events and in the decision making process, as 
measured by a 95% parental response rate in the NYC Learning Environment Survey.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

designed to meet their individual needs.

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 192, in compliance with Section 1118 of Title I and the Every Student 
Succeed Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Jacob H. Schiff, P.S. 192 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the  

school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-  

Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

P.S. 192 plans to use the major portion of the Title III Immigrant Funding to develop an after-
school academy that will provide direct instruction supplemental program for immigrant 
students. The goal of this program is to improve the language proficiency skills of the 
newcomers, transitioning level students  and ENL students who scored a level 1 or 2 on the ELA 
State Test. It will also support the learning of the core subject areas. This will lead to higher 
student achievement which will be reflected on ELA and NYSESLAT assessments. The goal is 
to decrease the number of students who scored a level 1 and a level 2 on the 2018 ELA State 
Test by 50%. 
 
This after-school academy will target 31 students in grades 3-5 that are at the Entering, 
Emerging, and Transitioning proficiency levels based on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT 2018 
assessments. Our instructional data indicates that 15 targeted students who are in Entering and 
Emerging levels need extra support in phonics, grammar and academic vocabulary as well as 
writing skills. Our instructional data also suggests that our 16 transitioning level students need 
extra help with their reading comprehension and writing skills. 
 
We will use IReady as the instructional program in order to support our students in reading and 
writing.  IReady is an integrated program that includes data-driven instruction designed to teach 
students the Common Core Learning Standards for English Language Arts. English will be the 
language of instruction. 
P.S. 192 will use the Title III Immigrant Funds primarily on hiring and sustaining 2 certified 
Bilingual and/or ENL teachers for 4 hours per week for 25 weeks. This after-school academy 
will operate on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:30pm to 4:30pm. The program will be 
launched on November 1st, 2018 and will end on May 23rd for a total of 50 sessions.

P.S. 192 plans to use the second portion of the Title III funding to hire consultants from 
“Educators for Success” (ESS) to implement a Family Literacy program. Consultants from ESS 
will teach “Masterful Parenting Course” to the parents of immigrant students. The main goal of 
this service is to expand learning from school to the community by strengthening existing 
parenting abilities and promote the development of the new competencies so that they gain the 
knowledge and skills needed to carry out child-rearing responsibilities and provide their children 
with experiences and opportunities that promote child learning and development. We are 
confident that educating parents to raise their children in emotionally healthy ways will help 
students thrive personally, socially and academically so that they become productive citizens in 
our society. 
 
While the purpose of the parent course is to provide parents with stronger parenting skills, it is 
also our goal to increase the level of parental engagement in the school. It is also our goal that 85 
percent of the parents will complete the school survey during the 2018-2019 school year. 
 
This course will target the parents of students who hold immigrant status. Our parent survey 
results indicated that 21% of the parents chose parenting skills as a type of program that would 
benefit them in creating a more successful and productive relationship with their children. 
 
Masterful Parenting Course will take place at our school library. The course will be delivered by 
Mark Rosenbaum and will continue for a total of 12 sessions, 1 hour and 30 minutes each. The 
first four sessions will take place once a month between November 8, 2018 to February 7, 
2019  and the last eight sessions will take place twice a month between March 7, 2019 and June 
13, 2019. Below please find the meeting dates and the topics to be covered:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 192 utilizes the following assessments to guide instructional planning for ELL's: 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Common Planning periods have been put in place to support teacher collaboration efforts in order to discuss and analyze 
student performance, strengths and challenges. During these meetings, teachers reflect and make adjustments to the 
curriculum, plan for different pedagogical approaches to address all learning styles and prepare differentiated lessons to 
support and improve students learning achievement. These common planning structured periods allow teachers to plan and 
implement specific interventions for ELLs. In addition, teacher schedules have been structured to support instructional time 
for Guided Reading and Guided Math small group work. Also, P.S. 192 has adopted the online system Skedula to empower 
teachers and instantly provide snapshots to parents and students to better drive instruction and learning.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 
We use the following summative assessments to identify baseline , areas of need and progress or growth in the various 
content areas that address ELLs specifically by allowing ENL teachers to establish baseline marks to determine targeted 
interventions and progressions throughout the year in reading, writing and math. For example, for Fountas & Pinnell, ENL 
teachers analyze student reading levels periodically to target individual needs and establish reading goals while providing 
differentiated ENL strategies . Baseline Writing Tasks help to identify the strengths and challenges of students with limited 
writing proficiency and determine the linguistic capacities of each student.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

During Common Planning sessions, teachers gather and analyze data to identify students’ needs to target interventions needs. 
High-risk students are the top priority for intervention services. Teachers also have periodic data meetings with a professional 
data specialist to analyze NY State Test results by examining itemized standard driven results. Based on these meetings, 
teachers are able to group students during Guided Reading and Guided Math by their specific instructional needs.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 P.S. 192 examines data to implement the RTI model by examining how Ell’s backgrounds and educational circumstances have 
impacted their academic achievement. Teachers regularly gather information through formal and informal assessment in a 
non-discriminatory manner to interpret assessment data. In addition, language development at all levels is fostered through 
purposeful, deliberate conversations between teachers and students. Teachers use student’s funds of knowledge and skills as 
a base to receive new knowledge and make teaching culturally relevant. Teachers create academically rigorous and challenging 
instructional goals for students while maintaining instructional supports they need to achieve success. Teachers and students 
engage in conversations to build, express and exchange ideas through questioning and sharing information. Teacher teams 
consider Ells’ progress and problem solve collaboratively using evidence from benchmark assessments and F&P results to 
make intervention decisions.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Teachers use the ELL Data Analysis Tool to inform their small group instruction and intervention needs. In addition, outcome 
assessments like ELA, Math, Science and NYSESLAT have been used to target students for after-school programs and 
academies. Overall, this data has been used to inform and impact daily instruction and set instructional goals. Teachers meet 
regularly to analyze the EDAT by filtering students by their risk level, state exam scores, language proficiency levels, SIFE, 
learning disabilities and years of service.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The data specialist meets with the entire school faculty to address, analyze and make suggestions for improving student 
assessment data. Teachers have professional development sessions with the data specialist to come up with intervention and 
pedagogical strategies to provide differentiation and multiple entry points to scaffold instruction.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students in block Monolingual classes are heterogeneously grouped and receive ENL services through the Integrated 
ENL model from a certified ENL teacher based on their language proficiency levels in accordance to Part 154 
mandates. Students at Entering and Emerging language proficiently levels receive 360 minutes of ENL services. 
Students at the Transitioning or Expanding level receive four periods of ENL per week for a total of 180 minutes. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We have two bridge transitional bilingual classes for grades 1/2 and 4/5. These classes are heterogeneously grouped 
and travel together as a class throughout the day. (We are currently using the 30/70 model where students are also 
instructed in their native language.)  
For the 2018-2019 school year, there will be no transitional bilingual classes.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The mandated number of instructional minutes is programmed based on proficiency levels. All students in bilingual classes 
who are Entering or Emerging receive 360 minutes weekly of ENL instruction with emphasis on effective ENL strategies as well 
as 60 minutes of Home Language Arts.  Ell’s who are Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes weekly using ENL 
methodologies and differentiated instruction as well as 60 minutes of Home Language Arts. Each teacher has a schedule 
posted which indicates the subject area being taught during that time period. 
 
In the TBE bilingual classes, the schedule indicates the language of instruction for each subject area and the time frame for 
each period. In these classes, 5 periods for home language instruction (HLA) are allocated during the literacy block, starting in 
Kindergarten and reducing the literacy block to two periods a week by grade two. The other periods of the literacy block 
during the week are in English Language Arts (ELA).  
 
In Integrated ENL, ENL teachers service students based on their language proficiency mandated by CR Part 154 during different 
content periods. Instruction is aimed to build English language skills where the ENL teacher provides differentiated instruction 
that allows students access to content that is being delivered in the classroom by using ENL strategies.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In Transitional Bilingual program, content areas such as math and science are offered in their native language 5 periods a 
week. In these classes, bilingual teachers provide support in student’s home language to make content accessible. Teachers 
utilize small group instruction that targets students’ language proficiency needs, the SIOP model, various scaffolds and 
collaborative learning techniques. 
 
In the ENL program, the instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language 
development are the utilization of the SIOP model, differentiating based on the language proficiency levels, small group 
instruction, the use of multiple modalities and cooperative learning. Teachers differentiate instruction by process, product and 
accessibility to allow multiple entry points to ensure all students are receiving an equitable and comprehensible education. By 
having this instructional approach, ELLs will be able meet the demands of the NYS Learning Standards.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Curriculum based formative and summative assessments for the ELL students in TB are offered in their home language. English 
Language Learners are assessed in their native language skills in the beginning of the year, middle of the year and the end of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

the year using Fountas and Pinnell (Evaluación de la Lectura) assessments.  ELLs are also evaluated by their classroom teachers 
in their native language by formative and summative assessments that are aligned to the curriculum.  ELLs are evaluated on a 
regular basis by classroom teachers as they confer with students in small groups or one-on-one.  They are evaluated both in 
Common Core State Standards work as well as with native language materials, designed to meet the needs of the students. 
Teachers will enter students’ scores on SKEDULA which will be accessible to students, parents, teachers and 
administrators.        
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

   
SIFE: In the event we have students with inconsistent or interrupted formal education, these students will be monitored for 
daily progress in either the TB or ENL program. They will receive targeted instruction and work in small groups with their 
teachers to ensure proper scaffolds are taking place to move that student to a performance level that is at or above the 
transitioning/intermediate level on the annual English language proficiency assessment. 
 
 Newcomer: Newcomers are students who have been enrolled in our ENL or TB program for less than 3 years. These students 
are paired with proficient students who speak both languages.  This peer support is very effective in helping students to feel 
comfortable in a new environment. Teachers welcome students’ participation in the learning process, in whichever language 
helps the student learn best.  As new language is being acquired, native language is used to access the content and 
activities.  Directions and instructions may be provided in both languages, with a variety of quality visual aids and/or realia, 
and other strategies used to reinforce and communicate concepts and skills.  Our newly-arrived ELLs are admitted as they 
arrive to our school and are welcomed, as are their parents.  They are informed of all school expectations, both verbally and 
through the sharing of the school’s Student Handbook.  The Parent Coordinator, as well as the class teacher, are available to 
provide additional translation, if necessary. 
       
Developing:  ELLs who have received 4-6 years of ENL services have their ENL and bilingual teachers create specific lessons that 
are comprehensible by making language and content very clear, achievable and with rubrics in both languages to emphasize 
expectations.  Process charts in the classroom are also posted conspicuously to support students’ learning.  Modeling, 
demonstrating, and explicit instruction are part of our school’s highlighted practices.  Student engagement and effective, 
actionable feedback to students provide for ample opportunities for students to practice independently and/or groups and 
partners, with teachers providing ongoing checks for understanding and actionable feedback for next steps.  Conferring and 
conference notes ensure that students receive consistent and individualized attention. 
 
Long Term Ells: Students are identified as LTEs if they have received English as new language instruction either in a TB or Free 
Standing program for seven or more years. Our Long Term Ells participate in an enrichment partnership called Reading 
Partners to differentiate their reading instruction, both by reading level and by interest.  They also receive instruction in small 
(4-6 students) and very small (2-3 students) guided reading groups.  These approaches help them receive focused, 
personalized, and low-risk attention.  The instructional coaches meet with ENL teacher and bilingual teachers to plan, with 
specific attention to best practices for ELL instruction and strategies.  These teachers also attend common planning sessions on 
a weekly basis with other teachers on their grade for both ELA and Math. 
 
 Former ELLs: Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL weekly for two consecutive years. These students 
continue to receive targeted and differentiation support by ENL teachers to ensure long-term language acquisition.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

We are working closely with the special education teachers, coaches, and the assistant principal that supervises special 
education to ensure that all the materials used in general education are accessible to all ELLs with special needs and that all 
students receive students services mandated on their IEPs as well as the mandated bilingual instruction.  We review all 
materials to ensure that they are grade and age appropriate.  Materials include our individualized computer programs such as 
I-Ready, IXL, Accelerated Reader and RazKids.  We look closely at their IEPS to determine what they are most in need of to 
provide them with an adequate form of instruction. ELLs with special needs are also participants of the project based model 
and have access to the same opportunities as all ELLs. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Teachers adjust lessons based on the needs of their students as per the data collected. Teachers of ELL-SWD students provide 
these children with multiple entry points to the lesson by changing the way the materials and classroom activities are 
presented. Careful attention to students’ learning styles, aligned with appropriate resources selected and provided by 
administration and teachers, matched to students’ interests and levels, serves to address students’ needs, without referring 
the students for self-contained classes.  General education classes provide wide opportunities for ELLs to interact with all other 
students, while receiving the appropriate services, as determined by IEPs.  Furthermore, teachers, in conjunction with the 
administration, parents, and related service providers, may elect (if the data supports this) to incorporate flexible 
programming into the student's IEP in order to give the child an opportunity to experience and succeed in a least restrictive 
environment. For example, a student in a self-contained special education classroom may receive instruction in a general 
education classroom for a portion of the day. All lessons are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards with 
modifications for individual students in order to ensure that each student's academic needs and IEP goals are met. 
Coordination of personnel allows for an effective sharing of students’ learning needs and IEP mandates.  Teachers are all 
expected to use IEP data, as well as all other available data, to make instructional decisions, personalized for individual 
students.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Intervention needs are met and offered in targeted instruction in ELA and Math during guided reading, guided math, after 
school, and AIS services. During guided reading, ells at the emerging and entering levels receive small group instruction to 
improve their literacy skills and strategies. During guided math, students are exposed to academic vocabulary and 
mathematical strategies to enhance their comprehension and problem-solving skills. High risk students also receive additional 
intervention services in the bilingual classroom to support their learning in Literacy and mathematics. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on our ongoing review and reflection, and to meet the needs of the students in our community, we are going to 
purchase additional laptops and create a second computer lab to create a technological capacity for all students.  In addition, 
we have begun the process of changing our chalk boards to white boards for a more efficient and healthier classroom 
environment. We are also in the process of creating a Guided Reading room where teachers can find and use appropriate 
materials for Guided Reading based on genre, interest and reading level.  In addition, P.S. 192 will be implementing a new 
writing program, Benchmark Writer’s Workshop,  to better prepare our students for state standardized exams and to ensure 
academic success in the future.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are afforded with opportunity to participate in after school program and supplemental services.  They are provided 
with the information for all programs in a timely fashion. All ELLs are invited to participate in after school programs, 
AmericaScores, which is a soccer program and various extra-curricular events throughout the year.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Mission Society is an organization that holds an after school program at P.S. 192.  This program is available for all students, 
grades K-5. This program offers supplemental instruction in literacy, math, science, social studies, and the arts in a smaller 
group setting. 
 
In addition, Reading Partners provides students with target intervention reading instruction.  Furthermore, the online reading 
and math programs will used to target our ELLs specific needs in reading and math and thus increase their reading fluency, 
comprehension levels, and mathematical skills.       
   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials used to support ELLs include all of the Common Core Standards-aligned reading and math 
curriculum materials, as recommended by the Department of Education (Go Math, Ready Gen and Benchmark Writing). Class 
libraries for ELLs include abundant independent reading books and materials, in both English and in Spanish.  These reflect 
both independent reading levels of the students and student interest.  Challenging books are also readily available.  The school 
consistently addresses its mission to develop an authentic love of reading by all students by encouraging great student choice 
in reading and providing extensive amount of time for independent reading.  Content area instructional materials include 
dictionaries, picture cards, flash cards, center based activities as well as leveled instructional texts, articles, hands-on 
manipulatives as well as activities involving physical movement to reinforce concepts. Home Language Arts materials are also 
offered in Transitional Bilingual Education classes. Technological materials include, SMART BOARDS in the classroom, as well as 
access to laptops and Ipads that allow students to use Internet resources (with guidance and supervision of teachers) to 
support their learning.  Teachers use SMART BOARDS to help ELLs and all students’ access material in an audio/visual way 
either through the use of images, videos or during shared reading and writing experiences to model learning.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language arts is an integral part of all our bilingual program. Students receive home language arts weekly as part of their 
program.  Home language arts is offered to ELL's in our bilingual program where they participate in content rich instruction 
with literature that is relevant and aligned to the Common Core State standards. Home language is assessed by using 
benchmark assessments as well as summative assessments. 
 
Students in our freestanding ENL program receive translated support as needed in their home language through the use of 
translated glossaries and the help of cognates in their home language.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required services support and resources correspond to the ELLs of all age levels and grade levels.  We focus on grade level 
according to common core state standards.  The materials used have been selected in accordance to student’s 
needs.  Academic supplemental services as well as instructional practice are held in accordance to each grade level. We review 
all text to ensure they are age appropriate and use materials that are appropriate proficiency levels for the students, but are 
not of the appropriate age level.  Services are differentiated according to need and students are regularly assessed to 
determine growth and movement as all of our programs have mid-unit and end unit assessments embedded.  Some of our 
technology program such as our use of I-Ready are appropriate for our ELLs and SWDs by meeting the cognitive needs of our 
students while being the appropriate age/grades for our students and assessing the students with each use.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We currently share the building with a middle school that is located on the top floor of the building. All students in the 
building share access to the school library and it's resources.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

Ells are part of every activity that is coordinated for the students as well as for the parents. PS 192 hosts meet the teacher 
night, Coffee with the Principal, etc. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Language electives are not offered to any of our students.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 All staff members will receive training from the field support center as well as experienced consultants. Bilingual teachers will 
receive the same training but will also benefit from attending training that are curriculum specific and that will target the 
needs of their students.    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All staff members will receive 15% of total hours of training which will focus on language acquisition , best practices for co-
teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners. 
Bilingual teachers will receive 50% of required professional development with a focus on best practices for co-teaching 
strategies, and integrating language and content instruction for English Language Learners. Ps 192 will be working closely with 
the Manhattan Borough Field Support to ensure that our staff receive the best professional development that will address the 
needs of our Ells. Agendas and attendance of held professional development will be filed by the Assistant Principal in charged 
of Ells. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
As CR Part 154 mandates parents are invited for a one to one meeting (in the parents preferred language) to discuss language 
development, goals of the program, assessment results and students’ progress. Parental involvement at PS 192 has gradually 
increased throughout the year.  We have had an increase of parents attending our parent workshop, curriculum night, 
Parent/Teacher Conference, etc 
 
Several meetings with ELL parents are conducted thought the academic year to discuss goals of program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development need in all content areas. The goal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

 

of these meetings is to integrate parents into the learning experience of their children and to reinforce the instructional goals 
of the school. The expectation with these meetings is to discuss and provide concrete information to parents about their 
child’s academic content and language development progress and needs. If the parent does not speak English, translation 
services and interpreters are available to make sure parents are able to fully communicate with school staff. If the parent is 
unable to attend the meeting, school staff will reach out to parents via email and phone to set up a time that works best for 
them. If an in-person is not ideal for parent, phone appointments are scheduled and logged in a parent/teacher conference 
binder.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

P.S. 192 provides numerous opportunities for our parents to become involved in the school community.  In addition, to the 
scheduled Parent/Teacher Conference (4 times a year), we also use an online program called Skedula to provide the families 
with opportunities to continuously have access to their child's academic progress, and where they can freely communicate 
with their child’s teacher in their preferred language.  The program provides the parents with a translation option to facilitate 
their understanding.  Parents are encouraged to come into the school building throughout the year to discuss their child 
academic performance, translation are provided for the parents when need. We also have parent associate and parent 
coordinator  who provides information sessions (in the parents proffered language) regarding the school’s culture, progress 
and continuity of services.  At the beginning of the school year, P.S. 192 offers parent orientation to introduce the faculty and 
welcome the parents.  We conduct various parent workshops throughout the month to get parents involved as well as to teach 
the parents skills (in the parents preferred language).

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Hilduara Abreu, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 192 consistently uses its resources to identify the parents’ preferred languages in order to effectively 
communicate their children’s academic and social progress, as well as giving them opportunities to access to 
services critical to their child's education. The first process in collecting data about our families' preferred 
languages occurs during registration. During the registration process, our ENL teacher interviews both the parent 
and the student to identify student’s Home Language. The ENL teacher explains the Home Language Identification 
process and guides the parent to complete the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). Prior to the 
completion of the HLIS, the parent is asked about the language they speak. If the parent speaks one of the DOE'S 
nine official languages, he/she is provided with HLIS translated to the spoken language. If the parent speaks 
Spanish, an in-house bilingual staff member will provide the interpretation during the HLIS completion and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

interviewing process. If they speak a language outside of the covered languages, an on-site interpreter will be 
hired to address the HLIS completion and interview process. 

The last section of the HLIS allows us to acquire information about the language preference in order to provide 
exchangeable oral and written communication with the school. Parent receives all the documents in their 
preferred language (Program Selection Form, Parent Survey, Parent notification Letters, and school letters). In 
addition, if the student is identified as an ELL, the parents are informed about the ELL programs offered in NYC 
schools through parent orientation videos in their preferred language. If the preferred language is other than 
those nine languages, P.S. 192 will utilize the translation and interpretation services of a DOE approved vendor.  

Once the HLIS process is completed the home language code of the student is entered in the ATS system. With the 
goal to establish effective communication with our parents, we use Parent's Preferred Language Report (RCPL), 
Home Language Report (RHBG), and Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) to assess language preferences of 
P.S.192 parent community.  

The Emergency Contact card will reveal the status of the preferred language whenever the parents need to be 
contacted by the school. A bilingual staff member or over-the-phone services will address this need.  

Once the preferred languages are identified, the Parent Coordinator will closely monitor if these parents' 
translation and interpretation needs are being met.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

parents.  

The parent handbook, which contains 
school calendars, policies and 
procedures is translated in house by 
our Bilingual Coordinator or Parent 
Coordinator to be shared with 
families. We will use NYCDOE 
translation unit to translate parent 
handbook in the nine official 
languages of NYCDOE but we'll use a 
vendor for the other languages 
preferred by parents. 

Monthly newsletters are translated in 
house by our Bilingual Coordinator or 
Parent Coordinator to be shared with 
families.  

Translated ELL parent notification 
letters are obtained from the DOE 
intranet website. The DOE translation 
services will be utilized when the 
letter needs to be sent to a parent 
who speak other than covered 
languages. 

These documents traditionally come 
translated directly from the NYCDOE 
to be shared with our families.  

School letters are sent through Class 
Dojo to inform the parents of school 
activities, meetings, and important 
dates. Class Dojo automatically 
translates the documents to the 
parent's preferred language.  

Flyers are shared with families and are 
available in the welcome center to 
inform and remind them about school 
policies, important dates, and day to 
day school activities. Flyers are 
translated in house by our Bilingual 
Coordinator or Parent Coordinator. 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of an emergency, the school will use the Student Emergency Contact cards to identify the parental 
language preference. If the preferred language is Spanish, an in house proficient bilingual staff member will contact 
the parent. Otherwise, the over-the-phone interpretation unit provided by the DOE will be utilized to communicate 
with families. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Teachers will be informed about Chancellors Regulation A-663 through professional development. The Language 
Access Coordinator will turn-key important information to teachers and staff on translation and interpretation 
services for parents. The professional development will cover topics such as the common nine languages of the DOE, 
the parents preferred languages, regulations, how to utilize over-the-phone and on-site interpretation services, 
differences between translation of parent specific and student specific documents, planning and action steps required 
for getting translation and interpretation services, the resources and the availability of the translation and 
interpretation service providers.  

 

P.S.192 teachers will be aware of the parental preferred languages of their students. The teachers will be informed 
about current language resources available to our school to best communicate with the parents of their students.  

All P.S. 192 staff members will be notified of the school policies to communicate with the parents whose preferred 
language is other than English in case of emergencies.  

The IEP service providers will be aware of the intranet resources that contain translated IEP documents. School staff 
members and the school safety agents will receive an over-the-phone card that outlines how to obtain an interpreter.  

We will identify bilingual staff members who are willing to and interested in assisting with communicating with 
Limited English Proficient parents through a school language survey and will create list of staff members who are able 
to assist with interpretation and translation. This list will be available to all staff, including the school's safety officers.

Furthermore, the school will distribute a yearly memo to school staff on the importance of language access. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The School will fulfill Section VII of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 by: 

A. P.S.192 will provide each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require language 
assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding 
translation and interpretation services. We will obtain translated versions of this document, in the covered languages, 
through https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/policies-for-all/parents-bill-of-rights 

B. The School will post the Multilingual Welcome poster by the main entrance, at the welcome center and at all 
parent entry points in our school to indicate that our school can assist them in their language and the availability of 
interpretation services . 

C. The School will keep the Language Identification Card in the school's front desk, welcome center, and in the main 
office in order to be able to quickly determine the language spoken by the parent and take actions to provide 
necessary interpretation and translation services. 

D. The School will send home 2018-2019 Achieve NYC Parent Guides in each parent's preferred language. 

E. The School will distribute Parent's Guide to Language Access brochure to parents to use when requesting language 
assistance services at school. 

F. The School’s safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are 
not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers.  

G. When more than 10% of the children at the school speak a primary language that is neither English nor a covered 
language, we will obtain from the Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation into such language of the signage 
and forms required pursuant to this section and shall post and provide such forms in accordance with this section.  

H. The School will inform parents of the Department’s website which provides information in each of the covered 
languages concerning the rights of parents to translation and interpretation services.  

I. The School staff members will be reminded of their responsibilities communicating with parents and the translation 
and interpretation services are available for them to address the language access needs.

Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

P.S. 192 will constantly monitor the quality of the language services by gathering feedback from parents through 
surveys and parent reflections from the parent workshops, as well as conversations with parents about the clarity and 
the extent of accuracy of the language service and the translator/interpreter. Feedback from the teachers collected by 
the School staff language survey will inform our school about the quality of the services.
