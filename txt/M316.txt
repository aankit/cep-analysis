Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The Mission of The Urban Assembly School of Business for Young Women is to provide a high quality college-
preparatory education to young women of diverse backgrounds in a nurturing and supportive environment. 

Our schools fosters the development and growth of intelligent and socially conscious young women who will think 
independently, embrace diversity, and grow intellectually and emotionally. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

UASBWY encourages in each student integrity, responsibility and commitment to community. We prepare our young 
women to become future business leaders by exposing them to all areas of business and career options in order to 
compete and succeed in a diverse and ever changing business environment. 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

UASBYW is founded on six fundamental principles (Service, Teamwork, Respect, Integrity, Diversity and Excellence) 
STRIDE. These fundamental principles are used to develop our programmatic structures. These are the distinctive 
aspects of our school: 

College Preparatory Education. 

The Urban Assembly School of Business for Young Women is a college preparatory high school committed to high 
standards and personalized attention to all of our students. Based on the premise that the study of business is a 
captivating lens for learning, and that the skills necessary to the profession are universal, we offer a rigorous 
academic program that engages students through the study of business. Our teachers employ a variety of 
instructional strategies in order to prepare our students for college. A typical day in one of our classrooms may 
include inquiry, debate, collaborative learning and small group instruction. All UASBYW young women are expected to 
complete four full years of English, Social Studies, Mathematics, Business and Science. Teachers plan collaboratively, 
class work and project based work are heavily infused with reading and writing and discussing. There is a strong 
emphasis on literacy development throughout the curriculum across the grades. 

Supportive Relationships 

At UASBYW every student is known well by a staff, advisor and or mentor. Teachers are aware of our student’s 
strengths and weaknesses. We have developed various structures that foster the development of supportive 
relationships such as our advisory program, mentoring relationships and Power Sessions. Additionally, all faculty 
members participate in grade level teams, where weekly discussions about students take place so that entire grade 
level team can intervene and provide them with intervention and next steps. Mentoring is major focus at our school 
and we have developed partnerships with Big Brother Big Sister as well as with other partner organizations. 

Integrated Partnerships 

At UASBYW, we have been able to foster amazing partnerships because we believe that learning transcends the 
classroom. Our young women learn very early, that the skills developed in school are transferable and relevant to the 
professional world. In the past three years we have developed community and corporate partnerships through which 
our students interact with the professional world and become aware of the different business fields and professions. 
Our main partners include, The Urban Assembly, , The Women’s Bond Club, Deloitte, AIG, Castle Harlan, Goldman 
Sachs, Junior Achievement to mention a few. These partners provide opportunities for our students through: 

Power Luncheons and school trips 

• Business theme-based curriculum 

• The development of an elective business education course for all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

• Job shadowing, college and career readiness opportunities 

• Agents of Change Program Community Service Program 

• The I-Mentor program 

UASBYW’s school community collaboratively developed the following specific goals that guide our work this year: 

1. 

Improving data driven instruction and organization in order to monitor and assess student progress. 

We are committed to making UASBYW a school where student progress is monitored closely and immediate 
intervention systems are in place to ensure that each individual student goal is met. 

2.  Extending and deepening our school’s community commitment to the development of literacy across the 

curriculum initiative. 

3.  Developing rigorous regents preparation courses that provide targeted, focused review of essential skills and 

test taking strategies on order to increase the Regent’s passing rate of our students. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We are a small single gender un-screened school that serves predominantly African American and Latino students 
from all five boroughs. Our school serves between 18-20% special needs students and 4% ENL. Many of the young 
women we serve come to us lacking strong social emotional and academic foundations. We enroll them in our 
Resilient Scholars program to support their development in these areas. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Literacy Focus: Our school wide goal of improving literacy across all content areas has proven to be effective and has 
impacted the acceleration of students reading scores. In every class, teachers integrate reading and writing through 
assignments and projects. Students are encouraged to read fiction and non-fiction (informational) texts related to the 
subject area. Our Modern Literature Seminar (MLS) is our independent reading program which is offered to our 9th 
and 10th grade and allows all students to have a dedicated reading period. This course is taught by all ELA teachers, 
providing opportunities for teachers to get to know the students well and their abilities and to impact their writing 
and comprehension at an early stage in high school. 

 

School Culture (Supportive Environment) 

There has been a noticeable improvement in school tone as we focused on building school culture. During the 
beginning years of a school the focus on developing school culture had to be evident. We focused on our core value 
RESPECT to engage students in this process. Last year we piloted the GEMS Campaign and we will continue to support 
this initiative in order to motivate our students to succeed both academically and personally. One of our goals past 
year was to dramatically change school tone and relationships between teachers and students and we will continue 
this work. This year we will be adding an emphasis on writing across the content area.  

A culture committee was established and a series of initiatives , including advisory, PBIS and student input onto social 
activities was underway. (further work on this initiative needs to continue in this school year). 

Teacher Collaboration 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

We have continued to develop and support collaborative teacher work at our school. We believe that our teams can 
achieve success only if we work together and persevere through the year. To this end we have PLC’s that meet three 
times per week, our Leadership team composed of department leaders and school leadership, drive the decisions 
around curriculum implementation, collaboration and professional development. Our grade level teams are 
composed of teachers who teach the same grade and come together to devise strategies to support our students and 
progress monitor around our attendance focus.  

Partnerships: ( Strong Family and Community Ties) At UASBYW, we have been able to foster partnerships because we 
believe that learning transcends the classroom. In the past 13 years we have developed a strong partnership portfolio 
that includes community and corporate partnerships through which our students interact with the professional world 
and become aware of the different fields and profession. 

Our key areas of focus will be Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment and Strong Family and Community Ties.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on the 2016-2017 school quality review the school was developing for Quality Indicator 1.2, and the findings 
were summarized in the following statement. Findings: Classroom pedagogy inconsistently demonstrated uneven 
student engagement. Student participation and meaningful work products was inconsistent in classes visited.The 
school did not receive a School Quality Review in 2017-2018.  

Based on 2016-2017 PPO feedback, Continue to develop pedagogy so that strategic teaching practices to push higher 
order thinking and encourage student discussions are consistently seen at high levels across all classrooms. 

Based on 2017-2018 PPO feedback, Classroom visits reveal inconsistent practices. Ensure that all teachers share an 
understanding of cognitive engagement, productive struggle and genuine discussion.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all students will improve their writing and reading skills as a result of the implementation of the Hochman 
Method in writing and Close reading strategies as evidenced by 75% of students scoring a 3 on Traits 2 and 5 of the 
MOSL rubric which will positively impact overall regents pass rates.

Teachers will use Internal Mock regents results as a tool for 
strategic grouping and differentiating instruction.  

Teachers will use formative and summative assessments to 
inform their instructional purpose as evidences in their weekly 
plans.  

Teachers engage in inter-visitation practices in order to observe 
writing processes and strengthen their own classroom practice. 

Teachers develop self assessment opportunities for students to 
evaluate their own progress. 

Teachers create learning targets for each unit and assess 
students at different intervals to understand mastery level of 
learning target.  

 

The assistant principal, with support from the parent 
coordinator will plan a common core outreach session for 
parents and through the Bakers Dozen in order to provide them 
with information and resources to support their students 
learning and track their progress using our online grading 
system.  

 

Teachers use student data reports to have conferences about 
progress and provide feedback on strengths and weaknesses. 
Teachers use student data reports to create individualized action 
plans for targeted students during progress monitoring 
meetings. Students utilize data sheets to develop mastery on 
areas of weakness as indicated from Data Sheets. Students use 
self-reflection sheets to take ownership of their growth and 
progress and reflect in times of success and times of difficulty.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Our school wide attendance for 2017-2018 academic year was 81%. We experienced a three point decrease from 
2016-2017 due to large number of severely chronically absent students.  

Our goal is to improve student attendance this year by creating systems to progress monitor daily and weekly student 
attendance in order to move students from chronically absent category.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will effectively create a safe and supportive environment as evidenced by a decrease in chronically 
absent students from 28% to 20%.  

As of February 2019, the number of students identified as chronically absent has decreased from 28% to 16%.

In 2017-2018 UASBYW's college ready scores were 17% in ELA and 7% in Algebra. The analysis of regents data 
conducted by staff over the summer months and September 2018 indicated that our students struggle with writing 
conventions. Most students did not attempt to complete the short answer/constructed responses in Science and 
Math regents and they also struggled to complete essays in ELA and Social Studies. There is a need to explicitly teach 
writing strategies across all content areas. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Based on our NYC School Survey 2016-17 report, our data shows that under strong family community ties we 
averaged 75% while the city average was 82%. This showed an increase of 5% from the previous year, but shows we 
underperform the city by 7%. 

90% of parents reported that they felt respected by their child’s teacher. 

81% agreed that they felt like they were partners with the teachers in their children’s education. 

At UASBYW we believe that the student success is only possible with the help and support of dedicated parents, 
teachers and staff. 

For the 2017-18 school year we will work on increasing parental outreach by 5%.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The Urban Assembly School of Business for Young Women uses a variety of strategies to maintain the highest possible 
standards of qualifications for its teachers. For teacher recruitment, UASBYW organizes a team of teacher leaders to 
participate in the recruitment process, and we seek candidates from the NYC Teaching Fellows program, Teach for 
America, through the Open Market Transfer system, and also by attending open houses at various local graduate 
schools of education. We actively seek candidates who have substantial undergraduate and graduate level 
coursework in their areas of instruction. 

For retention, UASBYW conducts regular meetings with all teachers (at the beginning and end of the school year) to 
discuss “career path” options and to provide mentoring and support for teachers hoping to pursue a career in 
teaching (or in school leadership). UASBYW actively encourages its teachers to continue with further graduate 
coursework and to earn additional degrees that lead to “highly qualified” status. 

UASBYW also has a tiered professional development that is tailored to the individual needs of each teacher. We focus 
our P.D. on a system of grade/department team meetings --- with teacher leaders and administrators acting as “team 
leaders” for weekly meetings and P.D. sessions for every core academic teacher in the school. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
At UASBYW teachers and school leaders engage in ongoing Professional Development on a weekly basis. The work of 
our Professional Learning Communities (PLC's), exist in department and grade level team structures. The focus is 
differentiated and driven by our school wide goals and teacher individual needs. Our teachers in grade level PLC's are 
working on action research centered on examining student achievement in the areas of credit accumulation and 
regents passing rates. Our department level PLC's are engaged in inquiry work centered on analyzing how instruction 
and learning impact students. Strategies include the use of protocols, lesson study, action research, peer visits, job 
embedded workshops and coaching.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
School administrators provide professional development for all staff during the first two days of September; on 
Election Day; on parent teacher conference days (pending DOE approval of schedule change); and in June. On all of 
these days, teachers, team leaders and administrators discuss the various assessment measures that are administered 
at each grade/subject level, and the school leadership solicits input from the teachers regarding these assessments. In 
August and September 2015, the school’s MOSL committee will meet to provide recommendations to the principal 
regarding the MOSL decisions, as a part of the NYC DOE Advance system for teacher evaluation. 

The administration will continue to seek feedback and suggestions from teachers throughout the year regarding the 
value and effectiveness of all assessments in order to make decisions about assessments and curriculum needs that 
will benefit the students in future years. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Urban Assembly School of Business for Young Women, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Urban Assembly School of Business for Young Women will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Meeting 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
ELLs literacy skills are assessed using the LAB-R and the Spanish LAB for the Spanish speaking students. Based on the results of 
the 
LAB-R, which indicate their initial proficiency level, students are programmed for isntruction. Every year, students are assessed 
using 
the NYSESLAT and are programmed according to the NYSESLAT results. Teacher created assessments are utilized to assess 
literacy.  
The assessments indicate that students need to continue to develop their reading and writing skills. Therefore, literacy 
development in 
all classes for all the students is one of the school's initiatives this year and part of the instructional plan. In addition, to 
listening and speaking, the ENL teacher emphasizes the development of reading and writing skills in her classes.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate student success by measuring student growth in all four language modalities, reading, writing, listening and 
speaking as 
shown on the NYSESLAT and progress in all academic classes and performance on the Regents examinations as well as 
graduation.  
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The complete list of test results from the most current NYSESLAT is unavailable.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

pushes into content classes. The ENL teacher works colloboratively with the teachers to write curricula and plan 
instruction. Intermediate and beginning students receive instruction in the self-contained model as well as the push-in model.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                All content area teachers are aware of ELL student status and educational needs based on the NYSESLAT results, and 
consultation 
with the ENL teacher. Argumentative writing, non-fiction reading, academic vocabulary, listening and oral language 
development 
are taught in the different content areas. In order to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet 
the 
demands of the Common Core Learning Standards, differentiated instructional methodologies which incorporate ENL 
strategies will 
be employed to address both those students needing further support and those ready for advancement. Individualized 
learning 
plans are developed for each student to establish current level of performance, set goals and establish progress throughout 
the 
year. Content area teachers are aware of each ELL student's home language and culture and attempt to make connections to 
content to establish a sense of familiarity, belonging and community. All content area teaches incorporate skills based learning 
strategies into their lesson, including literacy based intructional strategies such as the use of context clues, sentence structure, 
vocabulary development, decoding skills, and skim and scan skills. Cooperative learning and peer tutoring small group 
instruction 
are tailored to the specific needs of students. There is an increased focus on metacognitive skills and strategies and increased 
use 
of scaffolded glossaries. All classrooms are equipped with Smartboard technology allowing for interactive lessons, visual 
support 
of content specific language and audio accompaniment. Instructional approaches and methods used to make content 
comprehensible to enrich language development include: the infusion of ENL methodology in content area instruction, 
infusion of all 
four language modalities, listening, speaking, reading, and writing in all classes, use of cooperative groups, analyzing 
assessment 
data to inform and improve instruction, utilization of appropriate instructional materials, the use of native language support, 
and 
native language materials.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                When possible, student native language and literacy skills are used as a foundation for second language acquisition. 
For example, the use of cognates and use of the native language for expression and understanding. Students first language is 
validated when student are given the opportunity to express themselves in the native language if needed. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

ELLs in US schools less than three years (newcomers) are placed in a program based on the Parent Survey and Program 
Selection Form. If the parents select ENL, these students are then placed in the appropriate freestanding ENL classes based on 
their LAB-R scores and initial assessment. Both newcomers and SIFE will partake in the Degrees of reading prower 
assessments. The ENL teacher provides individualized instruction to meet student needs. In addition, extended one-to-one 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

instruction is provided by the ENL teacher. ELLs in schools receiving 4-6 years of ENL service are programmed for the 
mandated units of ENL instruction based on their proficiency levels indicated by their NYSESLAT scores. These students are 
encouraged to attend the Saturday school academic intervention services. Furthermore, ELLs receiving 4-6 years of service 
participate in the Degrees of Reading Power program. The long term ELLs are provided specific support in scaffolded activities 
to foster achievement on the NYSESLAT and NYSED Regents exams. For long term ELLs, interventions include but are not 
limited to the following: a focus on reading strategies, incorporating a variety or reading activities including both fiction and 
non-fiction/informational texts; a focus on a variety of writing activities that are based on both literary works as well as 
content area readings; the use of exemplars to model good writing; the use of graphic organizers to plan and organize for 
writing; and the use of revision, peer editing, and self-monitoring to model habits of good writers; a focus on listening 
strategies incorporating a variety of listening activities. Teachers utilize the following instructional strategies: differentiated 
instruction, scaffolding of instructional materials, QTEL strategies, note-taking strategies, graphic organizers, modeling of 
exemplary work and small group instruction in order to improve learners’ linguistic and academic abilities so that they become 
English proficient and meet State standards and graduation requirements. Teachers concentrate on teaching the Writing 
Process in order to support students with their academic literacy skills with a specific focus on higher-order thinking and 
writing skills and literary elements and techniques. In addition, the students take advantage of the light-sail web-based 
differentiated-instruction reading program. All current and former ELL students (up to two years) receive test accommodations 
including extended time and the use of glossaries/dictionaries. Former ELLs are also invited to attend Saturday school.           
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
General Education, ELL and Special Education teachers of ELL-SWDs collaborate weekly regarding student progress. The 
majority 
of ELL-SWDs are placed is the least restrictive environment to receive instruction in the content areas. Grade level materials 
are 
used in all classes. Graphic organizers are utilized to organize and chunk information. Hands-on lessons and lessons that draw 
upon multiple intelligences are implemented to encourage student participation and content comprehension. ELL students are 
taught 
specific organizational, study and test-taking skills. ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated on their IEPs. In order to ensure 
that 
ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandates ENL instruction receive the appropriate program, a review of the IEP, and ENL reports such as 
the 
RLAT, RNMR, and RLER is conducted before students are programmed.  
    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELLs students with disabilities are programmed for ICT English classes and the ELL teacher pushes in to provide students with 
English 
profiency skills in the least restrictive environment. This allows students to receive Special Education and ELL support in the 
least 
restrictive environment. During weekly PLC meetings, the ELL teacher, Special Education teachers and General education 
teachers 
colloborate to provide scaffolds, UDL, and CCLS aligned curricula.  
    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted academic intervention services for ELA, Math, Social Studies, and Science include but are not limited to the following: 
Saturday school tutoring in both ENL and Math, small group instruction, and after school tutoring. The ENL teacher provides 
individualized instruction to meet student needs. The Newcomer ELLs get extended one-to-one instruction with ENL teacher. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

Former ELLs are encouraged, and at times, programmed to attend ELL classes, as well as Saturday school programs to support 
advancement in their classes. Special needs ELLs also attend Saturday school programs and tutorials. ELL and Special Education 
teachers collaborate weekly regarding student progress. The long term ELLs are provided specific support in scaffolded 
activities to foster achievement on the NYSESLAT and NYSED Regents exams. For long-term ELLs, interventions include but are 
not limited to the following: a focus on listening strategies, incorporating a variety of listening activities; a focus on reading 
strategies, incorporating a variety of reading activities including both fiction and non-fiction/informational texts; a focus on a 
variety of writing activities that are based on both literary works as well as content area readings; the use of exemplars to 
model good writing; the use of graphic organizers to plan and organize for writing; and the use of revision, peer editing and 
self-monitoring to model habits of good writers. All current and former ELL students (up to two years) receive test 
accommodations including, extended time and the use of native language glossaries/dictionaries. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In addition to the self contained ENL model, this year, the school created a push-in model for the students who are at the 
advanced 
and intermediate levels. The school plans to continue to offer both the push-in model and the self-contained ENL model. The 
school 
introduced an advisory program for all students 120 minutes a week and a Drop Everything And Read (DEAR) program for all 
students 80 minutes a week. Both peer tutoring and the mentor/mentee programs will be developed this year and will 
continue 
next year. Additionally, we plan to continue to analyze and evaluate data displaying credit accumulation, assessment scores, 
attendance, and credit accumulation. This data is being provided to help inform all staff of the needs of all ELLs and create 
improvement plans to address those needs.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No program/services will be discontinued. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are offered equal access to schoool programs. All ELL students are encouraged to participate in the numerous academic, 
athletic and social groups provided by the school, including: Peer Tutoring, Mentor Mentee Program, Peer Mediation, Girls 
Who Code; Girls Volleyball; Girls Basketball, College, Culture Committee, Travel Club, and Business and Etiquitte Club. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our ELLs are receive instruction in the core classes using the same materials as the general population students. ELLs are 
exposed to 
text-complexity, academic vocabulary, non-fiction, fiction reading and argumentative writing in ENL classes as well as content 
area 
classes. Glossaries/dictionaries in English and the native language are used by the students. Visuals, audio, graphic organizer 
are 
used to address the different learnig styles and different proficiency levels. All classrooms are equipped with SmartBoard 
technology allowing for interactive lessons, visual and audio support . Students have access to laptops as well as computers in 
the 
library. Textbooks specially designed for ELLs, such as, from Reading to Writing, Short Stories, Focus on Grammar (text and 
audio),  
What a World - listening 1 and What a World - listening 2 are used. Newsela, a current events portal specifically for ELLS so you 
can slow down the reading and guide through a reading. 
    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered in multiple ways. Teachers support instruction with the use of the native language. ELLs 
are encouraged to use their knowledge and understanding of their native language to support their learning of English and the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

content areas. Materials are available for the students use. The school library offers a wide range of materials in the students 
native language and has access to all electronic texts in the New York City library system in multiple languages through a pilot 
program. The school librarian co-designs curriculum with teachers and assists in the resourcing of curriculum. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Resources are age and grade level appropriate. ELLs are exposed to text complexity, academic vocabulary, non-fiction and 
fiction reading, reading strategies, argumentative writing, listening skills and development of oral skills. Ells are instructed 
using the same level of text complexity as our general education students. Resources and required services correspond to each 
ELLs age and grade level. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our ELLs are receive instruction in the core classes using the same materials as the general population students. ELLs are 
exposed to 
text-complexity, academic vocabulary, non-fiction, fiction reading and argumentative writing in ENL classes as well as content 
area 
classes. Glossaries/dictionaries in English and the native language are used by the students. Visuals, audio, graphic organizer 
are 
used to address the different learnig styles and different proficiency levels. All classrooms are equipped with SmartBoard 
technology allowing for interactive lessons, visual and audio support . Students have access to laptops as well as computers in 
the 
library. Textbooks specially designed for ELLs, such as, from Reading to Writing, Short Stories, Focus on Grammar (text and 
audio),  
What a World - listening 1 and What a World - listening 2 are used. Newsela, a current events portal specifically for ELLS so you 
can slow down the reading and guide through a reading. 
    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs have the opportunity to attend the school’s summer program. The students are offered a class in English 
as a Second Language, and Math. They also participate in guidance counseling sessions. They also attend and orientation prior 
to the start of the school year - new student and parent orientation is given in English and Spanish. Students who enrolled 
throughout the year are assigned a student buddy who can make the transition to the new school, culture assimilation and 
language acquisition smother. Parent orientations for newcomers are on-going throughout the year.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish and French were offered to ELLs as language elective. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

This question does not apply to our school.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All teacher programs allow for four periods of professional development opportunities each week. These meetings allow the 
ELL 
teacher to participate in grade level and departmental meetings, to case-conference students, share instructional practices 
and adapt content in order to support the specific academic and language needs of each student. The guidance counselors as 
well as the school leadership are part of the professional development. The Assistant Principal, who has a background in 
English Language Learners meets with the guidance couselors and parent coordinator to review incoming ELLs and share varios 
ATS reports such as the RLER and RLAT. In addition, full day professional development opportunities will also give teachers and 
administrators exposure to strategies to support the needs of ELL students. The ENL teacher will provide the onsite 
professional development and will incorporate strategies and activities to meet the differentiated instructional needs of ELLs. 
All new general education teachers will be provided with seven and ahalf hours of professional development on ENL 
methodology. Professional development will be provided during twice weekly meetings and full-day staff development 
throughout the year (Election Day, Chancellors Day and Anniversary Day). All ELL and content area teachers, guidance 
counselors and administrators will be scheduled to participate in network and central professional development offerings (e.g., 
Common Core Intruction for ELLs, Enhancing Instruction for ELLs Through Scaffolds and Task Analysis ). All professional 
development is aligned with the school’s Language Allocation Policy.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Patricia Minaya, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to asses the school's written and oral interpretation needs, a review of the home language survey is 
conducted. Additionally, a review of the ATS reports ( RPOB) PLace of birth/home language indicator report and 
RLER is conducted to identify the students and parents home language. We also look at the RHLA to identify the 
home language survey. Anecdotal information is also acquired during parent conferences and open school. ATS 
reports indicated there are 21 current ELL parents. The data identified 8 languages other than Engilsh spoken at 
home. The languages Spoken at home are Spanish (11), French (1), Chinese(1), Arabic (2), Thai (1), Cantonese (1), 
Bambara (1) Sign Language (2). Once the data is collected we create a Family Language tracking report which is 
updated regularly with the languages that parents speak by class and grade level.
