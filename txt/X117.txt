Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles 

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
School Receivership   
In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which 
established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new 
law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools 
that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two-
year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City 
Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed 
under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          5 

 
core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant 
interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close 
achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 
the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.  

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students.

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          6 

 
The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive 
Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for 
continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing 
review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement 
activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. 
 

 
Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          7 

 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
  
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school 

and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs 

assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative 
data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs 

assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor 
progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school 
community know when you have reached your goal.   

  Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement 

Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections. 

  Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

In a brief narrative, describe the current state of the Renewal school addressing the following:  

1.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or 
special initiatives being implemented.  

2.  What are the school’s beliefs about student learning? 
3. 
4.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as 

Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are. 

partners in furthering student achievement  

5.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the 

Framework for Great Schools and indicate where this has been a challenge. 

6.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year. 

The Wade Academies MS 117X begins the 2018 - 2019 school year in " Good Standing." We are a Community School 
that serves as a pillar for our community. Our Community partner " Community Association for Progressive 
Dominicans" also known as ACPD has helped us transform to the hub of the Morrsania Community. ACDP plays a 
pivotal role in the services we offer families. From 7 AM to 10 PM Monday - Saturday, collectively, we are able to 
provide students and families with support in: attendance, mentors, college trips, monthly family engagement 
activities, community service projects, mental health services and referrals, free vision screening and glasses, free 
dental services, on-site Immigration services, weekly parent classes, family health and wellness activities and a host of 
other exciting partnerships, activities and services that help us achieve our mission and vision. 

The Wade Academies MS 117X middle school is located in the Morrisania section of the Bronx. We have 498 students, 
where 40% of our student population are ELL’s, 25% are students with disabilities, 95% have free and or reduced 
lunch, and 31% are STHP. Currently we share our learning community with The Young Women’s Leadership 568X, an 
all-girls serving grades 6 – 12 school. 

We have a Traditional Bilingual Educational Program (TBE) and a Free standing English as a Second Language Program 
(FSESL) for our students in grades 6 – 8. The primary goal of both programs is to offer CCLS Fir the 2nd consecutive 
year, we will continue our work using Expeditionary Learning and Teacher's College Writing Units, for all students 
including ELL and SWD's. Collaboration and planning with the ELA, ENL and IEP teachers help support our initiative to 
modify both our Reading and Writing Units of Study to incorporate scaffolds, differentiated tasks, parallel and station 
teaching techniques thereby addressing the needs of all learners. 

Our Vision is for all of our students, including SWD's and English Language Learners, to demonstrate increased 
achievement in mathematics and literacy and graduate from The Joseph H Wade Academies, college and career 
ready. We will achieve this mission by providing students with a safe, nurturing, educational community that develops 
the whole child through implementation of rigorous CCLS aligned instruction as well as systems and structures that 
support the social and emotional development of adolescents. 

Our Instructional Focus for the 2018 - 2019 school year supports our vision and mission. We believe if teachers check 
for student understanding multiple times throughout the lesson, assessing mastery towards the learning goal and 
adjusting instruction for struggling learners, then students will be able to demonstrate intellectual engagement 
through discussions and writing.  
 

To achieve this arduous task, we will continue our partnerships with Teaching Matters, Goldmansaur, Math Solutions, 
Legacy Pathways, Smart Start and the Borough Field Support Center. It is through our collaborative work that we have 
modified our instructional planning and practices and demonstrated improvement in both ELA and Math proficiency. 
Our strategic partnerships allows of to provide our learning community with, differentiated professional 
development, support for new teachers with on- site mentors, revise curriculum plans based on students qualitative 
and quantitative data and provide on-site coaching to teachers and teacher leaders.

This year, we identified lab site classes through our teacher leaders and facilitate monthly intervisitations. this 
practice enables us to identify and share best practices. Additionally we will continue our work and development of 
the protocols for inquiry teams using Data Wise and Instructional Rounds. These systems and structures supports our 
collective goal to build capacity, attract and retain highly effective teachers and improve the teacher pedagogy. 

To further support student diverse academic needs, we provide our students with SGI( Small Group Instruction) as 
another layer of differentiation. Using iReady data, students receive small group instruction on their iReady identified 
profile in Reading, three times a week. During this time, students are homogeneously grouped in three specific areas: 
Non - Readers ( students 2 or more levels below grade level); Independent Readers ( students that are 1 grade level 
below ); Proficient Readers ( students that are at or above grade level). Teachers facilitating the three different tiers 
receive ongoing professional development from: HD word for the non readers; the BFSC for Independent Readers and 
STEM Trainers for the Proficient Readers. Student progress is tracked and monitored by teachers and students are 
moved within the tiers based on progress, every 8 weeks. 

To support students in math we partnered with SmartStart. We hired 3 math teachers that will support our students 
in math 5 days a week, 6 periods per day. The SmartStart Teachers will primarily support targeted students who we 
refer to as "pushable and slipplables." These are students that are 5 - 10 scale score points away from attaining the 
next performance level on the NYS Math exam ( pushable) or 5 - 10 scale score points from reverting back to the 
previous performance level (slippables.) This unique cohort of students receive small group "pull -out" support in 
math, 2 to 3 times a week. Based on student data and the mastery on math standards, students receive targeted 
instruction on specific math standards. Weekly they are assessed on mastery. Students that need another layer of 
support, receive Khan Academy.  

We provide our students with academic extended day support 300 minutes per week Tuesday - Friday. All students 
are mandated to participate in ELT ( Extended Learning Time). During this period, students engage in IReady online 
lessons in both ELA and Math with the support of their teachers . 

While we want to ensure that we offer layers of support to all our students, we also make sure that we are providing 
accelerated support to students that have demonstrated acceleration in Science and Math. We provide students with 
an opportunity to take both the algebra and Living Environment classes and Regents. Providing all that pass with an 
opportunity to earn high school credit in middle school. 

To extend the opportunities for students in the "Arts," we partnered with LeAp, Dreamyard, and Creative Arts Team ( 
CATS). All of the partnerships have served as extensions beyond the classroom and have enabled our students to 
participate in: theater classes, an entrepreneur program, public art, Poetry and music. Last year, one of our 6th grade 
classes won the entrepreneur of the year LeAp competition, with their presentation on their company "Google Slime." 
One of our 8th grade students became a published screenwriter and her piece was performed live and 3 seventh 
grade classes had their art displayed in Claremont Park in the Bronx, from June - Aug 18'. . 

Our partnership with Girls Inc. and Planned Parenthood has also been an asset to our learning community in providing 
on-site support to our students in the areas of self-identity, self-worth, and healthy lifestyle choices. Through our 
partnership with Counseling in Schools, we are able to facilitate weekly group and individual counseling to our 
Bilingual students. 

In keeping with our theme to develop the whole child, we recognize that this is only possible through a partnership 
with our families. We have an open door policy for our families and make every effort to engage them through 
differentiated workshops, student performances, school activities and connections to outside family support services 
such as:

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support)

4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Strengths 

According to the 2018 Quality Review “School leaders and faculty ensure that curricula are aligned to the Common Core 
Learning Standards and academic tasks consistently emphasize rigorous habits. Curricula and tasks across grades and 
content areas ensure that students develop higher- order skills that promote college and career readiness.” This serves 
as an area of strength for our learning community. This is possible because the school leader and teachers have 
developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner within and across all grades and subjects. 

 

 

Priority needs to be addressed:  

Tenet 3.5, teachers implementing a comprehensive system for formative and summative assessments for strategic short 
and long-range curriculum planning that involves students reflections, tracking of and ownership of learning with 
teacher teams using data to drive instruction and develop curriculum, continues to be a priority area. According to the 
2018 Quality Review “ Across classrooms, teachers use rubrics that are loosely aligned with the school’s curricula . 
Teacher assessment practices inconsistently reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding.

Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
Our Instructional Focus for the 2018 - 2019 school year supports our vision and mission.  
We believe if teachers check for student understanding multiple times throughout the lesson, assessing mastery 
towards the learning goal and adjusting instruction for struggling learners, then students will be able to demonstrate 
intellectual engagement through discussions and writing.  

 

In ELA we incorporate Expeditionary Learning in the Reader’s Workshop and Teachers College Writing Program in the 
Writer’s Workshop for all students in ELL's and SWD's . Baseline writing and interim benchmark writing assessments are 
used to track student progress. Teachers meet weekly to: analyze data, look at student work, revise and create student 
tasks, and create CCLS Learning Targets. 

Our math teachers implement a curriculum aligned to the CCLS using Math in Focus. This year this year we are piloting 
Envisions in grade 6. As a district initiative, across all grades, math teachers are using the 5 Practices Protocol. This 
protocol is not a new curriculum but reflects a set of beliefs on how students learn best. The 5 Practices protocol, 
fosters a student centered approach, where the students engage in productive struggle and discourse with their peers 
around the math task. to take the Integrated Algebra class and Regents and received high school and regents credit. 
Baseline and benchmark assessments will be used at beginning and end of each instructional unit to track student 
progress and determine intervention needs. 

The social studies department follows the Scope and Sequence provided by the City of New York; which is aligned to the 
CCLS and the NYSED’s newly implemented Social Studies Framework. Additionally, ELA and social studies teachers 
receive professional development and support in facilitating student discussions through the Socioeconomic Integration 
/STEM Pilot Program supported by the Junior Grade Books Foundation. All SS, ESL, and ELA teachers use the shared 
inquiry discussion protocol to support student engagement and foster a student – centered learning environment. 

The science department uses Glencoe and supplementary materials to ensure CCLS alignment to the NYS Science Scope 
and Sequence along with various resources and hands – on labs to develop; including the City of New York’s Scope & 
Sequence, core curriculum materials, and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). this school year, our students 
grades 6 - 8 will have an opportunity o participate in a spring Science Fair, where students will present their 

For the 2018-19 School year, Teacher teams will continue to implement Data Wise 8 – step protocol to identify the 
Learning Centered problem and develop, review, discuss, modify student tasks and student work to support student 
achievement with a focus on English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. 

The Instructional shifts will be evident through the alignment of the performance tasks and Learning Targets to the CCLS 
to reflect: complex text, the inclusion of fictional and information text, and rigorous evidence-based conversations 
about text. Writing will emphasize the use of evidence from sources to inform or make an argument. Students will 
consistently build the transferable vocabulary they need to access grade level complex texts. 

During the Expanded Learning Time, students will engage in the following rigorous learning experiences: 

· I- Ready/ Khan Academy mathematics 

· I – Ready/ MyOn –Reading 

· Imagine Learning – Reading/Math (non English speaking ELL’s ) 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          19 

 

· Living Environment Regents Classes 

· Integrated Algebra Regents Class 

· Art, Dance, Tech, Theater, Poetry, Music 

The pedagogical practice will reflect a common set of instructional values and beliefs known as the “The Wade Way” 
that are evident in every class as well as a school wide agenda known as the “Flow of the Day” posted in every 
classroom. Both support our school’s focus on preparing our students for college and career readiness. 

All core classes will have the following structure: 

The Wade Way  

*All teachers will create CCLS aligned that includes the essential elements noted in the 5 component lesson plan 
template 

*All teachers will design Learning Targets that are meaningful, manageable, and measurable using the DOK and the 
CCLS 

language 

*All teachers will ensure opportunities for students to participate in student discussions using accountable talk stems 
and 

evidence from the text or task to support their claim 

*All teachers will persistently check for understanding throughout the lesson 

*All teachers will implement the 5 – minute rule 

*All Classrooms across all grades and content areas will have evidence of a Learning Target, A Quick Write, A Mini 
Lesson, 

* Teacher Modeling and Guided Practice 

 

All subject area class structure will consist of the following “Flow of the Day”: 

· Independent Reading (ELA only) 

· Learning Target Posted 

· Quick Write ( 5 min) 

· Mini Lesson 

· Guided Practice 

· Modeling

· Share out 

· Summary of the Lesson 

 

The teachers will use multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child by using student data, differentiated 
tasks, and facilitating student discussions grounded in the text. 

Consistency will be supported across school faculty and community educators and across a longer learning day by 
Weekly walkthroughs by the administrators, bi – weekly walkthroughs with the cabinet team, teacher intervisitations, 
reflection and feedback of the teacher team meeting agendas, mentor/mentee log of assistance. 

We will continue to use data collection systems to analyze and identify the next steps that will be taken to evaluate, 
monitor and track the pedagogical practices with regard to curricular revisions: 

The administrative team will conduct daily walkthroughs of the building in the form of "mini quick" observations (5-
minute classroom observations) as well as informal and formal observations noted in Advance. Both are documented 
and feedback is provided to the teacher within 48 hours. The administrative team will use Teachboost to log all 
observations and invite teachers via email to read the feedback. The Teachboost system is linked to Advance and will 
enable the administrative team to recommend professional development videos in the area of need as well as create 
graphs on teacher effectiveness in each of the Danielson Framework domains. Additionally, the cabinet team will 
discuss, plan and review content team meeting agendas and meeting deliverables to ensure the effective use of data to 
include: item analysis, student work samples and common unit assessments. All meeting agendas, feedback, and 
modifications of the curriculum will be uploaded onto Google Docs and monitored by the administrative team to ensure 
alignment and consistency. 

 

Resources for ELT: 

During Extended Learning Time students will participate in two academic days (Tuesday and Thursday). They will use 
the following programs: 

 

I – Ready ELA, I – Ready Math, Khan Academy, MyOn 

Every Wednesday and Friday, our students will participate in one of the following enrichment activities: 

  Glee Club, Latin Dance, Yearbook Club, Journalism, Theater, Fashion, Music Production, Spanish, Crochet, Film 
Club, Art, Forensics, Basketball, Community Service, Science Club, Photography, Exploration, Homework Help, 
Book Club, Travel and Geography, Restorative Circles, Chess, Table Tennis, Club Fame, Poetry, Film Critics, 
Puzzles, Computer Science 

 

 

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  
Our vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula will meet the needs of diverse learners personally, 
academically, and culturally through consistent and persistent professional development. Weekly content planning will 
provide content teachers with opportunities to collaborate, review, discuss, modify, differentiate and analyze 
instruction. We are strategically using the planning time to modify our instructional planning and practices to address

the instructional shifts with a focus on Shift 6 in ELA ; Academic Vocabulary and shift 3 and 4 in Math - Fluency and Deep 
Understanding 

 

 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
Through our partnership with our Community School, other community -based organizations, and in house systems, all 
students will have the opportunity to participate and receive support in social emotional programs that allow students 
to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be college and college ready. All students including ELLs and SWDs will have 
multiple opportunities and activities throughout the year in ELA, math, STEM, athletics, and arts enrichment programs 
that will offer students a broad set of opportunities to apply the skills gained during traditional classroom instruction in 
the core academic subject areas. Program examples include: Dance, Yearbook Club, Journalism, Theater, Fashion, Music 
Production, Crochet, Film Club, Art, Forensics, Basketball, Community Service, Science Club, Photography, Exploration, 
Homework Help, Book Club, Travel and Geography, Restorative Circles, Chess, Table Tennis, Club Fame, Poetry, Film 
Critics, Puzzles, Computer Science and Success Mentoring focusing on attendance and positive academic goals setting. 
Exposure to the varied programs and services provide students with more opportunities for inclusion, collaboration, and 
application thereby building upon our areas of focus for Academic Vocabulary, Fluency and Deep understanding. 

 

 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
The delivery of instruction will include culturally relevant curricula and resources that engage learners personally, 
academically and culturally, providing students with opportunities to engage in the text and content from multiple entry 
points such as: prior knowledge , real world connections teacher scaffolds and student discourse. 

 

 

How do you envision teachers using multiple entry points to ensure the success of every child? 
Teachers will engage students through multiple entry points to provide all students access to the text and content. this 
can take on many different forms and is contingent on the task or activity. some ways include, scaffolds, modified texts, 
access to technology, real world connections, and activities that stimulate prior knowledge, thereby support all students 
including SWD's and ELL's. 

 

 

 

What is your vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy (diagnostic, formative, benchmark, and 
summative) to drive curricular, instructional, and organizational decisions that impact student outcomes? 
Our schools' vision for the use of a comprehensive assessment strategy is very purposeful. We refrain from providing 
assessments for the sake of giving students yet another exam. We collectively decide as an instructional cabinet core, 
what assessments we will administer and when. We try to streamline our assessment initiatives with the city, state and 
district mandates, so the students are not overloaded with an abundance of assessments and we have an opportunity 
to review the data and make decisions on the needs for our school community and students growth. Our assessment 
goals is to ensure that the results from the assessment will help us make structural and curricular decisions that will 
improve pedagogy and student achievement.

Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
By June 2019 teachers will implement rigorous CCLS Units of Study in ELA and Math. This will result in a minimum 
decrease of 10% (181) Level 1 students and a minimum increase of 10% ( 131) in the number of students obtaining 
proficiency in Levels 3 and 4 in ELA. In Math this will result in a minimum decrease of 10% (267) Level 1 students and 
a minimum increase of 10% (87) in the number of students obtaining proficiency in Levels 3 and 4s as measured by 
the NYS standardized exams.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 
5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health) 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 5 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
5.2  The school leader establishes overarching systems and understandings of how to support and 

sustain student social and emotional developmental health and academic success. 

5.3  The school articulates and systematically promotes a vision for social and emotional 

developmental health that is aligned to a curriculum or program that provides learning 
experiences and a safe and healthy school environment for families, teachers, and students.  

5.4  All school stakeholders work together to develop a common understanding of the importance 

of their contributions in creating a school community that is safe, conducive to learning, and 
fostering of a sense of ownership for providing social and emotional developmental health 
supports tied to the school’s vision. 

5.5  The school leader and student support staff work together with teachers to establish 

structures to support the use of data to respond to student social and emotional 
developmental health needs.

1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 

2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 
Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section.

4.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
5.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

Strengths 

According to the 2018 Quality Review feedback, the school has developed strategies and allocated resources to support 
students social emotional development health (SEDH); all stakeholders are supporting the school – wide 
implementation of Positive Behavioral Interventions & Supports PBIS and systems are in place to leverage resources to 
support improved attendance, behavior, and targeted student support. However, a school wide strategic plan to 
coordinate all efforts and provide for the needs and social emotional potential need of each student is not yet in place. 

Priority needs to be addressed: 

Our Priority Need area is to establish structures to support the use of data to respond to student social and emotional 
developmental health needs. We are currently developing a school wide tracking system to identify and address the 
social emotional needs of the “at risk students.” This systematic structure will also enable the schools’ support staff to 
monitor the effectiveness of the services provided. 

Impact: 

All school stakeholders will work together to develop a common understanding of the importance of their

· We will continue to refine our systems and structures to address the needs of the whole child including building upon 
local partnerships to provide guidance and intervention programs onsite 

· We will re-establish goals for the 26% of students classified STP; students in temporary housing to ensure that they are 
receiving support services to include family services in the areas of mental health and social and emotional services 

· We will continue to refine our PBIS structures in order to ensure student ownership and full participation in a positive 
school culture and we transition to tier 2 structures and systems 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision? 
Stakeholders would describe our learning community as a safe and nurturing learning community where we work 
collectively to develop the “whole child.” Our main goal is to ensure that all of our students, including ELL and SWDs, 
receive CCLS aligned instruction that is not only rigorous, but also engaging, within a frame of systems and structures 
that support the social and emotional needs of young adolescents. We complement academic with multiple 
opportunities for our students to excel in the Arts through school – wide performances and presentations. This year we 
partnered with LeAp, to provide our students with opportunities to experience theatre and screenwriting; entrepreneur 
program and public art. this partnership permitted us to provide alternative platform for our students to cultivate their 
interests and talents. 

Our Social Worker supervises 3 social work interns from Columbia University and Iona, , for male youngsters that have 
experienced family trauma. This significantly impacts our ability to service more students in the development of their 
social – emotional well being. 

Through our Community School partnership we have an onsite Mental Health Clinic. A crisis manager that completes the 
intake process and a therapeutic social worker that serves as a clinician. She provides services to students and referrals 
for families when necessary. 

Additionally we have a Student Intervention Team (SIT); which consists of the following team members: Guidance 
Counselors, Social Worker, SBST Psychologist, Mental Health Social Worker, Deans, SAPIS Counselor. The Wade 
Academies is a large middle school with 498 students of which 25% of the student’s population has IEP’s and 40% are 
ELL’s. It is important to have a team in place to address the social emotional wellness of all of our students. This team 
meets weekly to discuss and develop action plans for students demonstrating inconsistencies in learning or social 
behaviors. This team facilitates class visits, assemblies, professional development for teachers, paras and families, 
provide Respect for All celebrations and trips. 

We will continue to use both an in – house survey and the Learning Environment Survey to identify student perceptions 
about their learning community and teachers and use the data results to modify and adjust our systems to support 
Wade Team Members ( Students and Adults). 

We will include elections for our Student Council to correlate with the upcoming elections and foster school and self-
pride. Student council representatives will also be invited to participate and attend the regularly scheduled School 
Leadership Team Meetings as well as serve as tour guide and facilitators on parent workshops. 

We will continue to provide incentives and support for our high achieving students through participation in the National 
Junior Honor Society. Selected students demonstrate strict academic and behavioral expectations. In N.J.H.S. students 
are encouraged to serve as peer mentors in content specific areas, help facilitate school activities to promote social, 
mental, and physical well-being. This has a positive impact on the entire school because it provides these students with 
a chance to showcase positive attributes to their peers and promote positive citizenship and scholarship.

families? 
Our CBO, collaborates with the school’s Parent Coordinator, Parent Association, school leadership, faculty, staff, and our 
Community School Team, to offer parents and family members many opportunities to participate in activities and 
workshops to foster a supportive and engaging school culture and climate. These opportunities include, but are not 
limited to, quarterly Community Resource Fairs hosted at the school, mental health workshops, Peer Group Connection 
family outreach nights, awards ceremonies, arts/crafts/athletics workshops, family volunteering initiatives, and constant 
communication with families through monthly newsletters, Mass text and email messaging, personal phone calls, and 
in-person conferences. 

 

 
Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Supportive Environment. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
By June 2019, the school will assign support services including mentoring and guidance to all “chronically absent” (17%; 
85 students) and “severely chronically absent” (8%; 39 students), resulting in an increase in the school’s overall 
attendance for the 2018-2019 SY of 92% as demonstrated in the New Vision Attendance Portal.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 4: Teacher Practices 
and Decisions) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 4 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
4.2  School and teacher leaders ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized 

around annual, unit, and daily lesson plans that address all student goals and needs. 

4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards 

(CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students. 

4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning 

environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths 
and needs of all students. 

4.5  Teachers inform planning and foster student participation in their own learning process by 

using a variety of summative and formative data sources (e.g., screening, interim measures, 
and progress monitoring).

Strengths 

According to the 2018 Quality Review, our learning community is proficient in the coherence and alignment to CCLS. The 
Curricula and academic tasks are designed to engage critical thinking and promote college and career readiness for all 
students including English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. The implementation of coherent, standards 
aligned curricula facilitates opportunities for critical thinking and preparation for college and career. 

The schools' strengths in the area of collaborative teachers are: 

• Additional time has been allocated during the academic day for teacher teams to meet, plan and use data to modify 
the curriculum maps and create instructional groups in the classroom. 

• Teachers use the Collaborative Protocol a modified version of a protocol tool to look at teacher and student work 

Based on the data, our Prioritized Needs are: 

• Teachers will use data to differentiate instructional practices and ensure consistent student engagement in rigorous 
and high interest work tasks for learners in all classrooms. 

 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          41 

 

Priority needs to be addressed: 

While there is evidence that our learning community develops teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about 
how students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to 
the curricula, across all classroom and grades students are not engaged, the learning tasks do not meet the needs of all 
learners so that all students produce meaningful work products. 

Impact: There are uneven levels of student engagement and demonstration of thinking varies across classrooms. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

Teachers have consistent time in their schedules to participate in weekly common content/grade planning team 
meetings during the instructional day to foster content collaboration, analyze student work, and discuss, develop and 
modify instructional plans that address student goals and needs through structured peer learning. 

The academies have been restructured to reflect interdisciplinary teacher teams or pods. All of the teachers in a pod 
teach the same students, enabling teachers to strategically support, monitor, track, and delve deeply into the student 
needs as well as partner with parents as a unit. This structure also allows teachers to coordinate team procedures and 
policies as well as plan team activities. 

During weekly grade and content meetings, teacher teams are create differentiated tasks to support all student entry 
level to include higher performing students. Through the implementation of the STEM/Socioeconomic Integration Pilot 
Grant teachers received training on how to facilitate “Shared Discussion Protocols,” in English Language Arts and Social 
Studies, thereby providing multiple opportunities to extend student thinking and understanding. In math and science, 
teachers will use color coded strategy cards to facilitate such discussions using sentence stems, assess student 
understanding, and differentiate instructional support based on student need. 

During our 80- minute Professional Learning on Mondays, teachers participate in a combination of pedagogical support, 
strategies and best practices as well as Inquiry Teams using the Data Wise protocol. This is another opportunity for 
teachers to analyze student work using the analysis of student work protocols to identify learning gaps and revise and 
modify Units of Study and lesson plans based on student work samples. Teacher Teams will also analyze student 
assessment data to determine next steps for students at all levels, using data to inform and assess effectiveness of 
instruction. 

Peer Collaborative Teachers and lead Teachers Mentors mentor all 1st and 2nd year teachers as per the DOE mandates as 
well as teachers having TIPS (Teacher Improvement Plans) as per their MOTP Ratings from the previous year. Mentors 
engage with teachers in a non-evaluative manner to assist, guide, and model how to implement CCLS coherently and 
effectively, while supporting teachers using a structured peer-learning model from New Teacher Center. 

 

 
 

How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and 
student learning? 
The school instructional cabinet will monitor teacher ASW (Analysis of Student Work) at the end of each unit in cycles of 
6-8 weeks, juxtaposing student baseline writing data with current student writing in order to determine growth.

Teachers will collaborate to conduct engage in lesson studies informed by student work to hone best pedagogical 
practices to support student achievement in writing. 

 

 

How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
Using the Datawise and Teacher Rounds structures and the DOE Professional Learning Communities Plan, teacher teams

writing rubrics across grade and content teams. 

 
What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon 
their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of 
data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are 
appropriately scaffolded.)

Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
By June 2019, teachers will engage in 6 Teacher Round protocols to tackle problems of practice to include targeted 
language strategies that support English Language Learners who are currently at the Expanding level in English 
proficiency (41 out of 197 students), This will be measured by the number of students who obtain Commanding level 
in English proficiency on the NYSESLAT in grades 6-8.

4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

For the 2017-18 school year, the school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district's Annual 
Professional Performance Review (APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observation and track progress of teacher 
practices based on student data and feedback through the use of Teachboost. Teachboost will allow the school leaders 
to track and compare the development of teachers and school wide and district wide, identifying the trends and area of 
need. It also enables school leaders to monitor the progress and growth of teachers over time, as they implement 
feedback and next steps. 

According to the 2015 QR Findings, the school demonstrates that, high expectations grounded in the Danielson 
Framework for Teaching are consistently communicated to staff by school leaders along with the supports of on-going 
professional development. School leaders and faculty communicate expectations connected to college and career 
readiness to families. The impact is that teachers are supported in meeting school leaders’ expectations through weekly 
professional development. Parents feel well informed about their children’s progress in school.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          48 

 

It is our goal to have an effective communication plan to educate all stakeholders about the school’s vision mission and 
instructional focus and how they translate in the respective subject areas across the school for all grades, and all 
students. This will be articulated in the Weekly Wade Times, the school’s newsletter to all staff, our common grade and 
content meetings and the monthly letter disseminated to parents in English and Spanish. We will ensure that the CBO 
partnership is strong by working closely with the CBO director. The CBO Director will attend all school related meetings 
and events, including the cabinet meetings, SLT. The CBO director will share office space with the parent coordinator on 
the first floor in our newly created family room. This will assist us in establishing a seamless relationship as we partner 
with families and address the needs of all of our students. Our CBO will help us expand the existing services we currently 
offer to families and students through our partnerships with Fordham University, Columbia University, the Walton 
Health Clinic and Morrisiania Health Clinic. The CBO partnership will also enable our learning community to house our 
own Mental Health Clinic with a Licensed Social Worker and a Bilingual Social Worker. Both will be onsite daily to 
support the Social and emotional needs of our students and families with immediate referrals. 

We have several evidenced based systems in place to demonstrate that the school and individuals continue to improve. 
Ongoing professional development on and off site will be provided to the following constituents: social workers, 
guidance counselors, parent coordinator, community director, paraprofessional, secretaries and school aides. The 
expectation of all school team members that attend professional development will be to turn-key the information 
gathered and learned to their respective cohort or department, in collaboration with the CBO Director and the 
administrative team. The team meeting attending the professional development with is required to debrief with one of 
the administrators and CBO director on the learning experience. Then he/she will develop an agenda that will be 
approved by one of the administrators proper to facilitating the meeting. The agenda, attendance sheet and materials 
will be uploaded and scanned onto Google Docs .  

To ensure alignment of services for students, we will make sure that teacher programs support student’s needs. We 
parallel programmed a special education class with a general education class to ensure seamless mainstreaming for 
special education students as per their IEP. We also looked at the IEP’s of the incoming 6 th grade students to ensure 
appropriate placement and class structures. Additionally, we strategically placed all of our ELL’S with IEP’s in the same 
class to ensure that they would have full class ESL and not the former Pull Out services; which interrupted instruction. 
We modified programs to ensure that all “transitioning, expanding and commanding “ESL students receive English 
Language Arts through the form of Teacher’s College Writing strategies. All of the systems noted, reflect our 
commitment to ensure that the needs of the students are our primary focus. It is our goal that we are meeting the 
needs of our students and are in compliance with all city and state regulations.  

To ensure that teachers are receiving high quality actionable feedback, we will conduct monthly Administrative Team 
Walkthroughs – class visits, to include identification of the focus, the expectations, debriefing and calibration of the 
ratings. We will invite the Leadership Coaches on monthly learning walks with administration to identify trends and 
check for evidence of professional development, and refining support given to teachers. Administrators will use 
observation data to develop targeted/ differentiated professional development for teachers in content areas to include 
supports for ELL’s, SWD’s and Overage students. We will provide professional development for teachers in three week 
cycles to further develop teachers’ Danielson aligned professional goals. Teachers will also engage in intervisitations to 
observe best practices and develop next steps for implementation in their respective classes.

Through engagement in professional development beginning in the summer of 2017 and extending through the 2017-18 
school year, the school will develop a robust model as a Professional Learning Community to support teacher and 
student growth. 

 

 

 
 

What is your vision for developing differentiated leadership throughout your school? How will you utilize teacher 
leaders to build broad capacity within your school?  
Through engaging teacher leadership roles, we will continue to support and engage in differentiated leadership across 
the school community by staffing 2 Peer Collaborative Teachers and 1 Model Teacher. 

 

 

How will the leader foster collaborative school governance processes, and ensure full family participation together 
with other stakeholders? 
By working Community School Partner and other community–based organizations, we will foster a collaborative school 
governance through the School Leadership Team and Community School Team to gather and engage full family and 
community stakeholders participation. This will result in greater transparency of school practices and shared ownership 
of the school’s mission, vision, and RSCEP goals.

Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
6.2  The school leader ensures that regular communication with students and families fosters their 

high expectations for student academic achievement.  

6.3  The school engages in effective planning and reciprocal communication with family and 
community stakeholders so that student strength and needs are identified and used to 
augment learning. 

6.4  The school community partners with families and community agencies to promote and 

provide training across all areas (academic and social and emotional developmental health) to 
support student success. 

6.5  The school shares data in a way that promotes dialogue among parents, students, and school 

community members centered on student learning and success and encourages and 
empowers families to understand and use data to advocate for appropriate support services 
for their children.

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

During the 2018 QR parent meeting, parents stated that they receive frequent progress reports. Teachers communicate 
with parents via telephone calls and text messages. Parents check their children’s grades, attendance and behavior 
reports through the Jupiter on-line communication system. Parents also meet with teachers weekly to discuss any 
concerns.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties 

What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school? 

When families visit our learning community, they are welcome. Once they go through the process of identifying 
themselves with the appropriate documents, they are sent to our parent coordinator. Our parent coordinator, Ms. 
Santana greets them and inquires what their needs are. Ms. Santana is fluent in English and Spanish and is able to 
effectively help parents navigate through the school’s systems to see, meet, or sit in the appropriate class. Depending 
on the nature of the visit, Ms. Santana, may escort the parent to the appropriate party to translate or just physically 
accommodate. This process is a modification of how we previously greeted parents. Prior to this initiative parents were 
greeted and sent to the main office. As a result of the change in practice our NYC School Survey responses from parents 
increased.

This vision for strength in community engagement centers on our “Welcoming Family Center.” The space will continue 
to represent a partnership between both the school and the CBO for the common purpose of enfranchising families and 
the community. We will use information from our SLT parent survey to ensure that the workshops and classes offered to 
parents are needed and purposeful. Parents stated that they wanted ESL classes and support to help navigate through 
everyday life such as: filling out applications, going to job interviews, creating resumes, doctor’s appointments and 
talking to teachers. 

 

 

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
Within our community school model we will effectively help parents navigate through the school’s systems to see,

escort the parent to the appropriate party to translate or just physically accompany them. This process is a modification 
of how we previously greeted parents. Prior to this initiative parents were greeted and sent to the main office. As a 
result of the change in practice our NYC School Survey responses from parents increased from 29% in 2014 to 78% in 
2018. 

 

At the beginning of the year, the administrative staff, deans, and school safety meet to revisit school protocols to ensure 
alignment and expectations and support. 

 

In addition to the differentiated workshops that are offered to parents through parent engagement and the PTA, we 
offer curriculum based professional development. These curriculum workshops are facilitated by the Guidance Team 
(HS Choices; HS application process), ESL Team (Parent Choice Interview/Video; Achieve 3000) the Instructional 
Specialist (NYS Testing, Jupiter Grades, CCLS). Families also receive progress reports 4 times per school year, weekly 
parent engagement activities, and 4 parent teacher conferences. 

 

Our Community Director has a designated space assigned for both the CBO director and the parent coordinator. This is 
our “Welcoming Family Center.” The space represents a partnership between both the school and the CBO for the 
common purpose of enfranchising families and the community. 

 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures? 
 
The school will survey all parents at the beginning of the school year, including orientation and open school night to 
recruit parent participation in the School Leadership Team and Community School Team, Parent’s Association and 
parent volunteer group. PA elections will be held at the end of the Spring term to determine executive leadership roles.  

 

We will use information from our SLT parent survey to ensure that the workshops and classes offered to parents are

such as: filling out applications, going to job interviews, creating resumes, doctor’s appointments and talking to 
teachers. Additionally: 

  A parent support center has been set up at the entrance to the school where our parent support team can greet 

and assess needs of individual parents. 

  Welcome signs and directions have been placed on main floor to direct parents to the family support center. 
Security has been trained and informed of all activities as to better direct parents upon entering the school.

How will the school engage the community and families? How will they ensure that teachers are able to learn from 
families about the children being taught? 
The School community will engage parents and families as follows: 

  The School community will schedule four annual parent-teacher conferences including an open house in 

October to facilitate opportunities for parents to learn about the school’s academic curricula, student 
expectations as well as provide an opportunity for teachers to learn from families about the children that they 
teach. 

  At the end of three marking periods, the school will facilitate student-led parent conferences where students 
will be developed to clearly discuss their core content academic goals with their parents and also discuss their 
work artifacts that demonstrate their progress toward meeting their academic goals. 

 

Family and community-based engagement is further driven through our CBO who will provide a greater range of 
services to our families, community and students by looking to: 

  Provide and communicate weekly structured time for teachers to meet one on one with parents through parent 

engagement 

  Develop and expand parent leadership through the Parent Association, participation on the Community School 

Team, and School Leadership Team. 

  Development of the school’s website to help communicate through social media w/ parents. All postings will be 

Bilingual 

  Une, a Text Messaging Service to send fliers and announcements to families 
  Monthly school based and Campus Community Schools Newsletter and calendar will be sent home via 

backpacks and email/text message distributed.

Utilizing the four parent teacher conference nights to 
provide an opportunity for multiple CBOs and supports to 
offer on-the-spot services and connections to services 
offered both within the school and larger community. 

This serves a twofold purpose as both a Parent leadership 
opportunity and a School Governance opportunity. 

This serves a twofold purpose as both a Parent leadership 
opportunity and a School Governance opportunity. 

Skill and enrichment based workshops based on parent 
expressed interests and needs. 

How do families partner with the school and CBO to support student success?  Will there be dedicated space for 
families?   
Family partnerships with 
school: 

The Parent Coordinator leads connection for parents to the school community 
through workshops, events, and outreach to foster greater parent and family 
connectedness to the school community. 

Family partnerships with CBO: 

 

Through continual messaging (weekly and monthly), parents are kept abreast of 
campus wide opportunities to participate in workshops and events as are identified 
by the campus Community School Team. Outreach is performed by a CBO dedicated 
Community Outreach & Engagement Coordinator and assigned AmeriCorps 
members in conjunction with the Community School Director. 

 

Is there dedicated space for 
these partnerships? 

Yes - there is a school specific Family Resource Center run by the Parent 
Coordinator, a Community Schools Office and Resource Center shared by the 
campus, and a Family Resource Pantry offering clothing, coats, homewares, and 
non-perishable food to families in-need.

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, all student subgroups in grades 6 – 8; including ELL’s and SWD will improve in literacy performance as 
demonstrated by the number of students attaining proficiency in Levels 3 and 4 as evidenced by an increase of 3 % as 
measured by the NYS ELA exam.

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as 

to promote higher attendance, reduces risk for retention or drop out, and increases the likelihood of 
graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  What new content areas and opportunities will be offered to students? How will the school ensure all IEP and 

language mandates are met during ELT? 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the 

supervision of a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area.

  How will community educators receive professional development?  Are there plans to provide joint PD to 

school faculty and community partner staff? 

  What content will be led by pedagogical staff and what content will be led by CBO partners? 
  How will the school best utilize CBO partners to impact student achievement? 
  How will effective outreach be conducted to families? 
  How will programming be made easily accessible to students and families in order to encourage 

participation? 

Our ELT program will provide all students with extra academic instruction in literacy, math and enrichment activities. 
The expanded learning time will provide students with an extra period, which will serve as their 9th period class. 
Students will alternate between math and ELA using an A/B schedule. ELA and Math Instruction will be provided 
through I – Ready, a digital/online reading and math application which caters instruction to the needs of students, 
based on a pre-assessment taken by each student. 

Students will also participate in one of 29 enrichment activities. In September, student took an online Google survey 
to identify their top 3 enrichment choices. The students will have an opportunity to switch groups in January. The 
clubs consist of the following: 

Glee Club, Latin Dance, Yearbook Club, Journalism, Theater, Fashion, Music Production, Writing in Spanish, Crochet, 
Film Club, Art, Forensics, Basketball, Community Service, Science/Innovation Club, Photography, Exploration, 
Homework Help, Book club, Zumba, Travel, Restorative Circles, Chess, Modern Dance, Poetry, Film Critics, Puzzles, 
Computer Science. 

Community educators will receive extensive training from highly experienced, research-based organizations such as 
Ramapo and Cornell. In addition all Community Educators are paired with a certified NYS teacher.  

Families receive ongoing, clear communication from the school about academic and enrichment, afterschool 
programs offered at the school throughout the year. Parents are also informed in writing and through our PTA, School 
Leadership Team, Community School Team and newly added, bi - quarterly Parent Academy. The Parent Academy is a 
sub-committee of the School Leadership Team and facilitated by teachers and the Community School partnership. 
They provide parents with hand – on experiences and information regarding the schools’ curriculum map. At the 
beginning of each ELA and Math unit, the Parent Academy meets on a Saturday and the parents go through the unit 
with the Instructional Specialists. They receive the materials, websites and strategies that will enable them to further 
support their children at home. 

 

Our CBO Community Outreach Team prepares a monthly attendance newsletter that is shared with all families. 
Students that have achieved 100% attendance receive certificates as well as their parents. Students that have 100 % 
attendance with not lateness go on special trips.

Our Community School Director and administration oversee the implementation of the ELT program. Instruction is 
provided by certified teachers from the Wade Academies MS 117X with the support of Community School Educators. 
Principal, Assistant Principals, and CBO Director will oversee the program. Teachers will facilitate the academic 
component. Where necessary, CBO partners will assist. CBO Partners will then facilitate the enrichment aspect of the 
program. Each grade will have a different enrichment day, this will permit the students to fully engage in both the 
enrichment and academic component of the ELT program while maximizing the opportunity to have a licensed DOE 
teacher deliver the academic instruction. 

 

The administrative team and CBO partners will conduct monthly walkthroughs to assess programmatic quality. The 
CBO in collaboration with the school will produce a weekly schedule/calendar of student’s enrichment and academic 
foci for the week. To establish an entry point for all students, we will administer a pre assessment. This will enable us 
to prescribe and diagnose the area of deficiency. The online tool generated from I Ready will also allow us to track 
and assess impact on student achievement. We will use benchmark assessments every 6 weeks, student surveys, 
parent surveys and staff surveys to assess the effectiveness of the program.

Part 2b. Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal 
program. 
1. 

Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together 
with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead 
implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

Our Community Partner, ACDP is the school’s lead CBO partner. Through this partnership, we have hired a 
Community School Director, Assistant Community School Director, A Crisis Manager, Social Worker and Family 
Worker. This is year two as a Community School. The Director is responsible for the day-to-day management of the 
community school strategy, facilitating and providing leadership for the collaborative process of developing a 
continuum of services for children, families, and community members. The Director drives the development of the 
community school action plans and plans for sustainability. The CSS team will track the school’s progress against 
performance goals, collect school data, and support program evaluation activities and manage partnerships. The 
Director will ensure that the community school strategy is implemented at exceptional levels of quality with full 
support, buy-in, and regular communication with stakeholders across the school community. Specific position 
responsibilities will include: 

  Build and maintain relationships with administration, faculty, staff, students, parents, and community 

partners 

  Organize and expand upon the membership of the Community School Team (CST) to include diverse school 

community stakeholders and CBOs

 

Identify needs of chronically absent students, apply interventions, and track and monitor impact of 
interventions on weekly basis, as part of weekly Attendance Team 

  Collect and monitor program implementation data and student data for each partnership that allow easy data 

analysis and interaction by the SLT and other school stakeholders 

In partnership with the school, our Community School partner assesses all students’ personalized needs to ensure 
appropriate programming opportunities are provided within the school day and during Expanded Learning Time (ELT). 

 

In-school support for students will be provided through the integration of one or more of CSS’s core solutions that 
provide an integrated focus on academic, social, and emotional learning, such that every student and family has 
strong relationships with the school community and an individualized pathway to success. Specific student supports 
implemented may include: Working with the principal, SLT, and CST (CET), our Community School Partner CSS 
provides comprehensive expanded learning and enrichment opportunities, and mental health services to meet the 
needs of all students. Additionally, they identify and invite other community – based organizations to partner with 
our learning community to provide support in ELT and professional development for faculty and staff. 

 

Parents and families will be welcomed into the school’s Parent Center, which will provide a safe, supportive place for 
parents to access resources at the school. All parents will be engaged in parent-teacher conferences at designated 
times during the school year but will also have opportunities to visit classrooms and engage in first-hand experience 
of their child’s academic learning throughout the year. Parents will also be invited to participate in monthly 
Community School Team meetings, parent Academies, and other forums where they can contribute their voices to 
the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their schools. Workshops provided for parents, by the 
Parent Coordinator, and other community partners, will focus on helping them learn how to advocate for their 
children.  

 

ACDP‘s Article 31 Outpatient Mental Health Clinic will provide on- and off-site services. Its bi-lingual staff includes 
psychiatrists, a part time nurse, licensed social workers, and licensed mental health counselors. The clinic workflow is 
very similar to AYP’s including comprehensive assessment, treatment planning, and collaborative discharge planning. 
The Clinic uses a person-centered approach to recovery and health promotion. The Clinic also utilizes perceptional 
care surveys, consumer advisory boards and workshops to gather feedback and to tailor policies and procedures to 
the population served. 

 

Dr. Norka Malberg will support the clinical staff in introducing the Peaceful Schools Project, an evidence-based 
intervention that has had success at the elementary level. Dr. Malberg is a Child and Adolescent Psychotherapist, 
trained at the Anna Freud Centre, with extensive experience working with high-risk adolescents. She believes that 
ACDP can successfully make the Peaceful Schools Project accessible to the middle school population. 

We will also link to the near-by health and behavioral and mental health resources, including an Article 31 clinic, of 
ACDP’s parent organization, Acacia Network. 

 

The Community School will engage parents, family members, businesspeople, and agencies that have a strong stake 
in IS 117 ’ s success. Town hall-style School Forums will be held monthly at times that will maximize attendance, with 
broad outreach, refreshments, pairing with student activities, and other attendance incentives. Simultaneous

The CST, Parents Association, and parent coordinator will develop strategies for communicating with 
parents/families, including outreach through tenants associations, beauty salons, churches, neighborhood stores and 
other businesses, sports leagues, the community education council, community board(s), elected officials, precinct 
councils and PTA/PAs of feeder elementary schools. Technology, including the website and school/home software, 
texting, email, twitter, and robo-calls, will be used for individual and group communication with parents and students, 
as well as flyers. The Coordinator and other staff will attend off-site community and parent meetings. 

 

As described above, barbecue, picnics, and other family events will provide additional outreach and engagement. The 
CST will coordinate activities with PA meetings and activities, open school and curriculum nights, Beacon activities, 
and adult education programming to engage parents when they are at IS 117, and to bring more parents to the 
school. 

 

The CST and principal will lead school staff in talking with parents about the Community School strategy in the course 
of parent-teacher conferences and other school events, and will prepare materials for distribution, integrating 
community school awareness into all aspects of school life. 

 

Parents will be engaged in individualized ways. Adult education classes and activities will be based on expressed 
parent needs and will also become places to discuss the Community School strategy. Broad outreach will be 
conducted to recruit Youth Mental Health First Aiders from among families, also helping to break down mental health 
stigmas and spread the word about mental health services. 

 

The Community School will include a range of on-site services for parents, including immigration assistance; health 
system access; housing assistance; employment counseling and resume preparation. Education counseling/advocacy 
will be provided for parents/family members regarding their IS 117 students, older and younger siblings, and adult 
and higher education. 

 

High school application preparation will be conducted with students and parents in all grades. External resources will 
supplement the guidance counselors to assist student/families and to arrange escorted opportunities for students 
and parents to attend high school fairs and visit high schools. 

 

Individualized outreach, including home visits as needed, will be conducted with parents and families to overcome 
obstacles that result in irregular attendance. Group family events will be scheduled to encourage families to expand 
their boundaries, such as trips to museums. ACDP will help make these connections and arrange for free or subsidized 
admission price.

Forums; participation in activities such as community walks; and increased attendance at curriculum nights and 
parent-teacher conferences. Success will include creation and publicizing of multiple forms for parent engagement in 
the school, including leadership development opportunities and trainings. Measurable objectives will include training 
opportunities for parents to become effective advocates for their children and for themselves and opportunities to 
participate in YMHFA trainings and implementation. Measures will also include CST member interactions with parents 
who don’t visit the school. Other measures will be parent and teacher/school staff self-reports of increased positive 
interactions, including collaboration around reducing absenteeism and increased participation in school-sponsored 
activities and field trips. Parent responses to the yearly DOE survey will also be an important measure of engagement, 
as will participation in adult education opportunities and high-school application preparation. 

 

Increased student participation in expanded learning and enrichment activities will be measured by similar criteria to 
the Beacon program. Enrollment and attendance are important measures, as are the program management, design, 
and implementation. Student input will be measured through Survey Monkey and by focus groups. Student project 
work products will also be markers of success. Student satisfaction with the high-school admissions process will be a 
marker of whether activities focused on this have been successful. The level and content of student response to the 
DOE annual survey will also be a useful measure of success. We will revise our surveys to include same survey 
questions. Parents will complete the surveys at different points during the year, enabling the school team to assess 
and analyze their responses over time. The same will be applied to our students. 

Measures for mental health services utilization and improved mental health will include outcomes of the YMHFA 
program, if the CST adopts it. These would include the number of “First Aiders” and the number of their interactions, 
which are compiled as a part of YMHFA. ACDP’s case management program, modeled on AYP, includes multiple 
measures of caseloads and effectiveness, providing markers for progress. Similarly, ACDP’s Article 31 Mental Health 
Clinic keeps meticulous records to provide evidence of utilization and client satisfaction. Programs such as 
Therapeutic Crisis Intervention in Schools, focused on de-escalation skills, include success indicators such as course 
completion. Indicators such as reductions in extended absences, disciplinary referrals, and suspensions will also 
provide evidence of school climate improvement, conflict reduction, and improved mental health. 

The Coordinator will compile measures of improved school resources, which will include in-kind programs and 
services, materials donations, and new funding streams. The Coordinator will maintain records of resources solicited 
and received. The Coordinator and the principal will ensure that records are carefully maintained on the receipt and 
use of funds to assure that proper use is made of them.

Section 9: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

We 
currently 
have 178 
students in 
Temporary 
Housing. 
This 
represents 
32% of our 
student 
population. 
These 
students 
include 
students 
that are in 
temporary 
housing 
(shelters), 
as well as 
families 
noted in 
double –

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The school wide MOSL Team in collaboration with the administrators discussed assessment options, reviewed the 
MOSL results and options for the 2017 – 2018 school year. Collectively the team made decisions on the selection of 
tests; subgroups and local and state accountability. 

During professional development and PLC’s teacher teams review formative and summative data. Each teacher 
identifies the lowest 5 performing students in their respective classes and create action plans for the students with 
benchmarks to assess students achievement. Additionally, during these meetings, teacher teams work collaboratively 
to identify and or create CCLS alignment common unit assessments with CCLS itemized questions. This enables our 
school community to monitor and track mastery on the standards and inform our modification of existing and future 
units. 

Surveys are conducted on teacher knowledge, comfort, and abilities with specific strategies so appropriate PD can be 
provided and inter – visitations can be effectively set up to encourage specific assessment practices. 

Teacher teams design rubrics that effectively assess student work. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

          82 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. MS 117X in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Joseph H. Wade MS 117X , will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          84 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary Education (ESSA) Act; 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          85 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

I. We will be implementing a Language Academy which will enhance our mandated program for  ELL 
students. Our goal is to provide rigorous academic instruction to support the progress of our growing student 
population. This is a bilingual literacy program that will equipped students with an array of learning strategies 
to help them strengthen their home language skills, acquire a new language and build content knowledge. The 
program is designed to address the differentiated needs of our students. Students will be engaging in speaking 
and listening activities to help them develop oral skills before engaging in reading and writing.  The goal is to 
help students achieve oral literacy; engage in collaborative conversations with other students to make sense of 
an oral argument; listening with a focus and determining the main idea of a video or a picture. Teachers 
will use graphic organizers and visual aids to facilitate understanding of content-topics at grade level. The use 
of models, sentence frames and language prompts will support students language development at different 
performance levels. 
1.Newcomers/ SIFE:Students who arrived to the country during this school year and never attended a school 
in the United States and Students and SIFE students performing significantly below grade level. These two 
groups usually perform below grade level in all four language modalities and a significant number of these 
students  lack basic literacy skills in their home language. They will receive additional  instruction in their 
Home Language (Spanish), in English as a New Language, and in Math. This is intended to develop and 
strengthen basic reading, writing and math skills in their native language in order to facilitate and accelerate 
academic achievement in the content area while building new language acquisition. 
All academic instruction will provide additional practice in the four language modalities, focusing on the 
development of academic vocabulary and language complexity, building background knowledge, and 
developing reading comprehension in all content areas, including mathematics. 
In their Home language, these students will engage in the reading of current and culturally relevant readings, 
exploring grade level-texts by native authors. At the beginning of the program, students will complete a 
survey that will allow us to explore those topics that are of interest for the students. The reading selection will 
respond to the interests of the students.  
In ENL, students will be using the Unit for beginners ELLs, developed by the American Institute Research 
and made available by the Department of ELL Learners and Students Support. This is a CCLS-aligned unit of 
study designed to help teachers scaffold challenging texts to make them accessible for ELLs. Students will be 
provided with multiple entry points that will support their understanding of the text. This is 
particularly  significant since only 25% of our ELLs achieved a commanding performance level in reading, 
according to the RLAT. This number is lower than the number of students performing at the commanding 
level in Writing, which was 33%. 
In all, the AIR Unit will provide students with the scaffolds and learning skills needed to approach a grade 
level text in order to achieve comprehension. Students will use graphic organizers, word study activities and 
other strategies that will help them make sense of a text. 
2. We will use the term Transitional for students who have been in a New York City school for 1-3 years; 
students who have acquired a level 1 in the ELA and/or the Math state tests.  In addition to the AIR Unit 
mentioned above, this students will be using the Vocabulary Toolkit , a program designed to help 
ELLs elevate their level of academic language by studying, listening, and applying Tier II vocabulary terms. 
The two groups stated above will also engage in literacy activities intended to increase reading 
comprehension and improve text-based writing. Some of the strategies are: using guiding and supplementary

questions; word banks, close reading activities, cloze writing activities, the use of sentence stems,  pictures 
and other visual representations to clarify meaning. 
3. Long Term ELLs 
Even though these students are verbally fluent and can easily navigate in the social scene, they struggle to 
hold academic conversations and academic writing. These traits impede many of them to reach commanding 
level in the NYSESLAT. This group usually scores below the proficiency level in ELA. They battle with 
reading analysis and argumentative writing. This group will be provided wiith additional help in both 
modalities. Students will engage in Shared-Inquiry Discussions and debates that will promote the use of 
academic content-rich language in the academic setting. Students will also use the Academic Vocabulary 
Toolkit that will facilitate the understanding of academic word, grammar and complex language structures.

These professional opportunities are designed to increase teacher understanding of ELL 
data,  learning expectations for ELL students in each one of the language modalities, according 
to the new CCLS Bilingual progressions. Teachers of ELLs will also become familiar with 
learning strategies proven effective to increase achievement among ELL students. These 
professionals will also expand their knowledge about what teaching strategies to employ in order 
to make grade-level material accessible to all ELLs, creating multiple entry points.  
PD will also deepen their understanding of how ELL students acquire language,  and what do 
they have to do to demonstrate mastery  at each performance level.  
Increasing opportunities for academic speaking and listening in the ENL/ ELA and content 
classrooms will increase the language performance of all ELLs.

1. Parents of ELL students will be offered classes to learn how to navigate educational websites 
and familiarize them with the expectations of standardized testing: ELA, NYSESLAT, Math. 
State Tests: New Expectations for ELLs 
Tuesday, December 11, 2018 
10:00-11:00 
Facilitator: Ms. Diaz, ELL Coordinator 
This workshop will be at no cost to Titlle III 
2. Using technology to support your ELL at home: Skedula,  I Ready,  Imagine Learning, 
Imagine Math 
A bilingual ENL teacher will provide strategies and resources to support student academic 
development at home, demonstrating  the use of educational websites such as the ones mentioned 
above. Parents will use a computer to navigate these websites. Classes will take place for one 
hour on the following date: 
Monday January 28 , 2019 
2:20-3:30 
Facilitated by Alida DelaCruz, HLA certified bilingual teacher  
This workshop will be at no cost for Titlle III.  
During parent meetings we have noticed that in all,  parents have limited understanding about 
what it means to be an ELL, the identification process and the entrance and exit requirements to 
the bilingual /ENL program. In general, parents are unfamiliar with the high academic demands 
their children faced due to the new Common Core learning Standards. During this workshop we 
share with the parents samples from the NYSESLAT and the ELA tests and walk them through 
the new instructional shifts and how do they reflect in the state testing. We discuss academic 
demands and how can parents can support students learning at home. 
Around 85% of our families speak Spanish at home. Often times, parents ask about ENL classes 
for adults. Achieve 3000 family edition is another way in which we support the family members 
in their effort to learn English. 
Parents will be notified via phone blast in English and Spanish.  Flyers will also be sent home to 
parents in both languages. An effort will be made to send flyers home in other home languages 
such as Arabic and Bengali. Workshops 1 and 2 will be facilitated by bilingual (Spanish) 
pedagogues. A Spanish translator will be provided for workshop #3.  
Parents invitations, agendas and attendance records will be kept in the Title III binder in the 
office of the Assistant Principal, Ms. Vargas, room 306

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At JHS 117 we use a variety of assessment tools to measure literacy skills and language acquisition of our ELL students such as 
CC-aligned reading diagnostic tests in English and Spanish and writing baseline assessment. These two in house 
assessments are used to determine literacy and language ability at the beginning of the school year, and as a reference point 
when determining student progress throughout the school year.  Writing portfolios, including speaking and listening rubrics as 
proof of assessment, are maintained in the Integrated ELA and SA ENL classrooms to track student progress in all language 
modalities.  In addition, at the end of every curricular unit, students complete a short constructed response and a long 
constructed response. These responses are assessed using the NYSESLAT rubric and provide students and teachers with data 
to determine progress towards Target of Measurements and learning standards. All assessments mentioned above are in 
addition to the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and NYS Math tests. 
The implementation of Shared Inquiry Collaborative Protocol is a formative tool the teachers use in the classroom to measure 
student progress in Listening and Speaking skills.  Unit pre and post classroom assessments also allows the teacher to 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          98 

 

determine which students are moving toward content and language goals within the unit. In an everyday basis, teachers use 
an assessment sheet, developed in house and based on TOMS and Language Progressions, to determine students 
daily progress towards language.  This tool also ensures alignment between learning standards, Targets of Measurement and 
instructional goals and tasks. This assessment tool is also used in the Home Language Arts (HLA) classroom. ENL and 
HLA teachers track language progress in the same areas and assess using the same lens. 
Formative assessments and curriculum embedded assessment data informs our instructional planning in several ways. For 
example, teachers gather the data to determine what learning standards or Targets of Measurements were mastered and 
which ones still represent a struggle for the students. Those standards in which students did not achieve mastery, are 
embedded in the new unit. Assessment data is also use to inform groupings, determine alternate learning and teaching 
strategies and ensure that students are provided with different entry points, according to their level of English proficiency. 
At the beginning of school year 2018-2019 , ENL and ELA co-teachers will meet to look at the RLAT, containing disaggregated 
NYSESLAT data on student performance in the last three school years. Collaboratively, teachers will look at their assigned 
students to determine overall progress on language acquisition.  This data will be used by co teachers to create groups and to 
plan instructional strategies that could help students growth according to their needs in each language modality. Since all ELA 
co teachers had participated in Q-TEL training, they will be able to incorporate Q-TEL strategies  found to be effective with 
ELLs, such as the anticipatory guide,  as a pre reading activity and as a toll to encourage student discussion.   
As a next step, teachers will be looking at the 2018-2019 EDAT to identify long term ELL students and students at risk to 
become long term ELLs. This data will be used to determine what students will receive Academic Intervention Services, 
RTI,  and how this intervention will look like, based on their individual performance. 
Comparison data from 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 reflects gains in scale scores in all language modalities. Listening showed an 
increment of 7 points, Speaking, 10 points, Reading 6 points and Writing 17 points.  Comparison between 2016-17 and 2017-
2018 scores, is not available as of yet. As soon as NYSESLAT results are available, we will commission  District Public to create a 
comprehensive analysis of the new data and will make instructional and organizational adjustments to address deficiencies 
reflected.  
Overall, 2016-2017 NYSESLAT data stemming from the RLAT shows that 20 out of 206 students (10%) achieved a Commanding 
level; 3 students in the 6th grade, nine students in the 7th grade and 8 students in the 8th grade. This data however, reflects 
the current roster and not the roster of all students who tested last year. Therefore, the 6th grade data shows our incoming 
class. The exiting 8th grade NYSESLAT data is not available as per the RLAT. 
In the same way,  125 students or 61% moved up one proficiency level; 56 or 27% remained at the same proficiency level and 
8 students or 4%, went down one level. Scale score gains within the same level have not been calculated yet. We will use the 
ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to determine progress of those students who remained at the same PL.  Another look at the 
current 7th and 8th grade students NYSESLAT data shows 20 students taking the NYSESLAT for the first time, who scored 
Emerging, Transitioning or Expanding. Same group shows 14 students moving up two or more PL. 
During the month of October, and after reviewing other state assessments, ENL and HLA teachers submit an action plan for 
the lowest 3 students. Based on the expectations of the Language progressions, teachers and students set goals, which are 
revised every 8 weeks. In the Achieve 3000 classroom, teachers conduct data talks with the students where they are 
prompted  to talk about their progress and track movement toward their goals.  
Teachers use assessment data to inform grouping, to determine class and individual student progress toward the CCLS, to plan 
instruction and to make modifications to the current curriculum, addressing the instructional and language necessities of each 
proficiency group. Using current data, students are placed in diverse groupings, including small groups, partner and whole 
group instruction to support daily learning goals. Student work is further supported through verbal and written feedback that 
aligns to ENL Language Progressions and Targets of Measurement, as well as the CCLS in the ELA classroom and the  ELA/ENL 
Integrated classroom. 
In addition, we provide differentiated support to our students through our Title III allocation.  We will offer an afterschool 
program that is geared to support the specific language and literacy needs of each of the ELLs subgroups. Units of study 
published by the American Institute of Research (AIR) specially design and scaffold for ELLs are incorporated during the 
Saturday Program for students in the bilingual program and newcomers.  
During the year 2017-18 we received approximately 35 newcomers, or students who entered the United States for the first 
time. Most of them Spanish speakers, others speakers of Ga and Twi. NYSITELL data shows the vast majority scored  at the 
Entering level with a few at the Expanding level. For the students at the Entering level we created a Saturday school program 
geared to build on basic language and social communication skills.

          99 

 

Academic Intervention services will be incorporated during the school day for selected potential LTELLs, current LTELLs and 
SIFE students. 
Teachers of ELLs are organized in pods, or groups that will instruct the same cohort of students. This will facilitate targeted 
professional development and participation in inquiry teams intended to research and implement instructional practices that 
best work with ELL students. The implications for our learning community overall is to provide differentiated support to all of 
our ELL students in the areas of Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing, at the same time we raise the performance 
expectations across the school, for English Learners. 
 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have several structures in place to support instructional planning efforts. The ENL/HLA Department holds weekly meetings, 
destined to discuss teaching and learning strategies, look at student's work, review student progress, modify curricular units of 
study to include adequate scaffolds for ELLs and implement departmental-wide strategies based on formative assessment.  
Bilingual classes are scheduled to use Imagine Learning Language and Imagine Learning Math during Extended Learning Time, 
three times a week. All sessions are structured in the same way. During this period, students listen to a mini lesson in an area 
of need,  before initiating the their independent practice. Students advance at their own rythym and the teacher monitors 
student progress to assist those students not progressing on their own. Professional development is provided twice a year, on 
how to access and analyze Imagine Learning students reports. During this sessions, time is provided for teachers to loom at 
the results and plan next steps for their classes.  
Based on NYSESLAT results, at the beginning of the school year students are scheduled to receive mandated units of ENL and 
HLA service, according to the program selected by the parent and their 2018 Performance level. For the second year, we are 
implementing the use of the Vocabulary Toolkit with both the bilingual and FESL classes. Collaboratively, at the beginning of 
every unit, ELA, ENL and HLA teachers select the Tier II words that will be taught for the following weeks. These academic 
terms are then displayed in all classrooms, incorporated in the daily Quick Write, modeled by the teachers and expected to be 
incorporated during student discussions. 
In addition to the ENL mandated units of service, FESL students are programmed to receive 180 minutes of Writing Skills a 
week, provided by  certified ENL teacher. According to the EDAT analysis, most LTELLS and potential LTELLs are housed in the 
FESL program.  
Regular education, content teachers and bilingual teachers are provided with ongoing professional development to help them 
understand the process of second language acquisition; learn and implement ENL teaching and learning strategies in the 
classroom; use the HESS cognitive matrix and the Bloom's Taxonomy to design and scaffold rigorous task for ELLs. In fact, 
during the last three summers our teachers have taken part in professional learning opportunities to help them prepare to 
better serve ELLs. During the summer of 2016, six teachers of ELLs participated in the Q-TEL training offered by NYSED. The 
summer of 2017, 16 of our teachers, including bilingual teachers, ELA teachers, HLA teachers and instructional leaders 
completed 16 hours of Q-TEL training Building the Base, as preparation for instructing our growing population of ELLs in the 
school. During the summer 2018, 7 content and language teachers also completed a Q-TEL cycle.  The last two PD series were 
provided at our school site  at no cost for the teachers.  
   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need?

Performance Series (BOY, Mid Year and EOY)MOSL - Science and SS (BOY and EOY)I-Ready Ready Paper and PencilImagine 
Learning Language (Pre and Post Assessment)Imagine Math 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have several structures in place to address interventions once the summative data has been desegregated. For example,

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
When an ELL student does not show progress according to the NYSESLAT we determine what support services can we provide 
provide to the student determination is based on SIFE status, years of service,  years served in the bilingual or the 
FESL program, socio-emotional support needs and other factors such as home language literacy needs, student work produced 
in English and in the home language, overall grades and progress in the state ELA and Math assessments. Based on these 
criteria, we either provide AIS  or RTI in either Math, ELA or Language instruction, in the models of pushing in or pulling out. 
Bilingual educational evaluation, is recommended if the student has or is suspected of having a learning disability, however, 
RTI is provided to student prior to a referral for evaluation, where there is a suspected learning disability as opposed to a 
language acquisition need.  
Currently all classes, including bilingual and FESL are scheduled for 2-3 periods of RTI a week. During these periods students 
identified in need of additional support are grouped based on the academic area of need and received targeted instruction in 
groups no larger than 10 students. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
RLAT is printed at the beginning of the school year and shared and discussed with teachers of ELLs. Professional development 
is offered for teachers who are not familiar with the report just so they are able to navigate and understand the data 
contained. This report allows teachers to determine what is the language modality of strength and the weakest modality of 
every student. It also permits to track the ability the student has to progress, identify those students who are close to achieve 
proficiency, and students who are at the verge of becoming long term ELLs,  Along with the RLAT, we shared the RYOS with 
ENL/ELA teachers.  
The EDAT is another tool we use. The report generated by the EDAT is shared with the instructional cabinet and placed in 
Google Docs to be accessible for instructional leaders and administrators. The report provides teachers, coaches and 
administrators with an overview of ELLs in every classroom, an their overall data, scores by modality, English proficiency level, 
ELA and Math scores, disabilities  and risk factors in one single document. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
Reports are shared with teachers during departmental meetings and with cabinet. Teachers of ELLs are provided with 
professional development to help understand the language acquisition process and strategies to support the teaching of 
content to ELL students using a variety of speaking, listening, reading and writing strategies and appropriate scaffolds.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We are a 6-8 middle school with a departmentalized structure. We do not have any self contained classes and all our 
students move from class to class based on their schedule. With the exception of special education students that are 
mainstreamed, all students travel as a class each period. We have three general education ICT classes (one on each 
grade); one Bilingual Special Education class; three FESL classes (one on each grade); one TBE 6th grade class; one TBE 
7th, one TBE 8th grade, and one bridge TBE Spanish class (new arrivals). The bridge class houses only two consecutive 
grades, according to the number of students we admit each year.  
Students in the FESL classes are scheduled to receive a combination of Stand Alone ENL and Integrated ENL periods in 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
101 

 

 

 

          

 

 

the content area, where the ENL and content pedagogues co plan and co-teach to deliver language and content 
instruction to the ELLs in the classroom,  using ENL strategies and scaffolds to support the learning of complex 
material. 
FESL and TBE classes are organized heterogeneously, based on their English proficiency level, and based on parent 
option.  This year we will continue to create heterogeneous classes, where students of varied proficiency levels had 
the opportunity to interact with English proficient classmates in the target language. 
This summer, the school instructional team and the ELL liaison will worked collaboratively to determine the program 
models and teachers' assignment. We worked together to match the students' PL to the most effective teacher in 
ENL, ELA and HLA. Decisions are made based on students' language needs and previous data of student progress. 
 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Students in the TBE Program receive a combination of Stand Alone ENL services and Integrated ELA-ENL, where the 
ENL and ELA pedagogues co plan and co teach to deliver grade level content, using a variety of strategies to make 
content accessible for ELLs. This year, TBE classes will be integrating AIR Units as part of their curriculum. 
TBE classes house students at various proficiency levels. Due to parent option, most students in this classes are 
Entering to Transitioning.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All students in the FESL Program will receive the prescribed amount of instruction as required by Part 154.2. 
Students in the TBE Program will also receive the prescribed number of instructional ENL and HLA minutes as required by the 
New CR Part 154.2. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content area instruction is provided in the student’s home language with intensive support in ENL and HLA in the mandated 
time allotment. The ENL component focuses on developing the students’ language skills in the four modalities: listening, 
speaking, reading and writing. Our content area teachers provide instruction in both English and Spanish. Content instructional 
materials are available in English and Spanish. Internet based material provide content access in other home languages such as 
Arabic and French. 
In the beginning stages of English language acquisition, 70% of instructional time is provided in the student’s native language 
and 30% in English. As the student acquires vocabulary, develops fluency and reading understanding, the English instructional 
time increases according to new Part 154.2. Students receive grade level/ standard-based academic work, within the 
framework of differentiated instruction and differentiated assessment. 
Students in our FESL classes receive all of their instruction in English, with native language support in the classroom. As per 
NYSESLAT data, students are appropriately placed in Entering-Expanding classes. They receive their mandated allotment of 
ENL and ELA by certified teachers. While ENL methodologies are used in the content area classes, instruction is delivered in 
English. The use of the home language provides additional support for content specific comprehension. In addition, language 
and content area teachers instructing these classes are trained in the use of ENL strategies and methodologies to support the 
language acquisition of ELLs. Teachers of FESL receive support from an ELL coach who is available weekly to answer questions, 
discuss challenges, and offer options for instructional modification. 
Our ELA/ENL/HLA departments follow a parallel curriculum. Reading materials are related to the grade appropriate classroom 
topics that ELLs are being taught. The ENL/HLA/ELA teachers follow a pacing calendar or Units of study to ensure school wide 
continuity. 
ENL and HLA teachers meet weekly for common planning. During planning sessions teachers examine students data to monitor 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
102 

 

 

 

          

 

student progress, review CCLS-aligned tasks, use rubrics to assess students' writing, discuss instructional shifts and watch 
videos of best practices, among other topics. Pedagogical discussions on how to make a rigorous curriculum accessible to ELLs, 
takes center stage. 
   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 Students are appropriately evaluated in their native language. Students entering the school, who’s main language is Spanish, 
are given the LAB in Spanish to determine reading comprehension in their own language. Additionally, at the beginning of the 
year, students take a standard-based diagnostic reading assessment and a baseline writing assessment.  
Teachers evaluate students' reading and writing abilities through formative assessments such as questioning and the use of 
exit slips, Unit assessments as well as summative assessments. Students are formally and informally assessed before, during 
and after every Unit. Since native language skills can vary greatly within the same grade level, results of formative and 
summative assessments are analyzed and used to modify instruction in an individual basis. 
   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) We have several initiatives to attend the needs of Students with Interrupted Formal Education. Our SIFEs are instructed 
basic reading and writing skills in their native language. In many cases, the HLA teacher employs the use of the 
"cartilla fonetica" (a book which compiles the sounds of consonants, vowels and most common blending sounds and syllables 
in Spanish), and index cards with sight words to teach the child to read and/or develop fluency.  As we strengthened their 
native language skills, we also build their self-esteem. In a short period of time, the SIFE student can experience success and 
recover confidence in his/her ability to learn. This constitutes an important step, as we prepare them for the acquisition of 
English as second language.  Newcomers identified as SIFE as well as those students who are performing two or more years 
below grade level in their native language, also participate in our HLA pull out program, offered by a Spanish certified teacher. 
Students are pull out once a week to receive instruction that develops literacy skills in the native language. Special attention 
goes into reinforcing reading fluency and comprehension as well as grammatical and writing structures. 
 
In addition, SIFE who had not yet attained language proficiency, are participating in an after school program.  This is an 
interned based reading intervention program that targets phonemic awareness, language, memory, attention, processing and 
sequencing skills. The program addresses all four language modalities, including speaking, as it "listens" to students while they 
read out loud, intervenes when they struggle, and automatically scores students' oral reading. 
 
Seven percent of our ELLs are SIFE.  Seventeen percent are Long Term ELLs. 
 
b) For newcomers who have been in the US school system for less than one year, the ESL teacher uses a specific set of 
instructional strategies. At the beginning, the students need to be acclimated to the school setting. The ESL teacher gets 
students started with English for communication, which can help them navigate day-to-day activities and socialization skills. At 
the same time students are being connected to everyday situations, they are strategically introduced to academic situations 
and academic language. Teachers employ a great amount of visuals and manipulatives, to help convey the instructional 
message. The instructor also provides ample opportunities for listening and speaking in the classroom. Additionally, students 
are allowed extra response time to encourage participation. The teacher also assigns “work buddies”, where older students 
assist the new students in the transition process. All instruction is guided by the NYS Learning Standards for ENL and the CCLS. 
 
c) For developing students  who have been in the school for one to three years and who are required to take the ELA, are 
placed together according to NYSESLAT results. These classes receive language and content instruction in English 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
103 

 

 

 

          

 

with NLA support. Teachers study the composition of the classroom and assessment data beforehand, and scaffold their 
teaching to make content and concepts comprehensible for these students. Lessons incorporate 
visuals, manipulatives and realia to support the acquisition of complex language and deeper understanding. Vocabulary is 
emphasized. At this stage the teacher equips the student with strategies that can help them decipher new words: the 
understanding and use of prefixs, suffixes, word roots, family of words and the use of context clues. 
Our curriculum alignment provides for the HLA and ENL teachers to address the same Standards, work on the same topic, 
strategies and skills at the same time, allowing students to transfer what they’ve learned in one classroom to the other. We 
pay special attention to cognates to facilitate reading comprehension. Emphasis is placed on lesson planning so it includes 
daily opportunities for speaking, listening, reading and writing in the English language. 
ENL and HLA teachers meet once a week for curriculum common planning, look at student work and monitor students' 
progress toward Unit goals/standards. As a result of these collaborative discussions, curriculum is adjusted. 
 
d) Based on Parent Option, most students receiving four to six years of ENL services are placed in FESL classes. Others are 
placed in regular education classes and receive ENL support through the co-teaching model. All  instructional support is in 
English and instruction is designed based on the results of the NYSESLAT. We plan authentic ENL learning experiences that 
focus on their areas of weakness. In most cases students are verbally fluent with a high level of comprehension. However, they 
do poorly on CCLS-aligned testing due to low level writing skills and in some instances, poor listening skills. Therefore, we 
incorporate tasks, which reflect all four language strands with strong emphasis on Listening and Writing, highlighting the use of 
academic terminology.  
Four-six year long term ELL students receive differentiated instruction within the ENL classroom according to their needs as 
per NYSESLAT results. As the previous group, this group of students have a strong verbal skills and an extensive range of social 
language, however, they lack understanding and mastery of content and academic language.  Instruction for long term ELLs 
focuses on advance grammatical structures and the development of academic language to express knowledge and 
understanding of content. Through Circular 6, identified teachers provide small group instruction to targeted students. 
A new action plan has been developed to respond to the 39 long term ELL students we currently have and prevent the 
students with 4-6 years of service to become LTELLs: 
•      Who are the LTELLs in my classroom? 
•      What are the characteristics of LTELLs? 
•      How ELLs learn best? 
•      Strategies to engage students with limited language proficiency in academic conversations and collaboration 
•      Research based strategies to support content and language development 
•      What are the language expectations for ELL students? 
•      Targets of Measurement and the expectations of New Language development 
e. Before the spring testing begin, we identify those students who have attained Proficiency, according to the NYSESLAT, in the 
last two school years. During the state testing, these students are pulled out from their regular classroom and grouped 
together by grade in a separate location. They are allotted time and a half to complete the ELA, Math, Science and any other 
state assessments. 
 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At school we use several instructional strategies with ELLs with disabilities that allow access to  academic content and 
accelerate English language acquisition. ENL and ELA teachers ELL-SWD, have participated in  Q-TEL training in the last two 
years. Instructional activities for this population ensures that students participate in "pre reading" activities such as Novel 
Ideas, Anticipation Guides, Four corners, that allow students to engage engage in academic-based speaking and listening, prior 
to engage in a complex reading. Students are provided the opportunity to connect prior knowledge to new knowledge and 
anticipate academic vocabulary that may be encountered in the reading that will follow.  "While reading" activities include  a 
variety of tools that can be visual, auditory, or that promote hands-on work with language.  
Additional teaching strategies present in the ELL-SWD classroom include:

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses flexible programming in a variety ways.  We provide our students with the appropriate number of units of ENL, 
ELA or Content Integrated Instruction and HLA as per compliance.  We ensure block programming for our students to assist 
with the transition from elementary to middle school and to provide more time for quality instruction.  Additionally, when 
recommended, students receive individualized programs to reflect mainstream in specific content areas. Flexible programming 
is used to maximize the time ELL-SWD's spent with non disabled peers. SWD Bilingual classes are scheduled to attend Gym and 
Lunch with other ELL and regular education students. In addition, when allowed by their IEP, ELL-SWD students are grouped 
with other students during the Saturday Academy and the after school Title III programs (Language Academy). 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our goal is to provide ELL students with the necessary support to access a regular education curriculum in ELA, Math and other 
content areas. To this end, we have implemented targeted intervention programs to support students in reading, writing and 
language development. 
* In collaboration, language teachers determine ways to scaffold rigorous tasks and employ techniques to make the readings 
comprehensible for ELLs in every classroom. To support the teachers, we have also created two professional learning 
communities where ELA, Math, Social Studies and Science teachers of ELLs look at the work the students are producing and 
collaboratively come up with strategies we can implement school wide to improve ELL outcomes.  
*ELA, Math, SS and Science teachers of ELLs participate in weekly ENL Strategies meeting. The main purpose of these 
professional development sessions is to equip ELA and content teachers with ENL techniques they can use to facilitate 
knowledge  content and language. The focus: 
ELL students are mandated to participate in the ELT and encouraged to participate in additional after School Programs and 
Saturday and Vacation Academy Programs, where they receive intensive support in ENL, HLA and Math in small 
groups. Additionally, our school wide Social Studies and Science midterms are translated and offered in the students' home 
language.  
During the Summer, ELLs are encouraged to participate in STEM courses such as Science Invention Project and Robotics Camp, 
where Science and Math content is integrated as part of the Enrichment program and provided both in English and home 
language. 
    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on current data, we will are considering the following improvements in the ENL Department: 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELL Coordinator work collaboratively with Math and ELA Instructional Specialist to ensure that after school programs and 
Saturday Academies do not overlap Title III programs for ELLs. In this manner, in addition to the programs designed to support 
students language development, ELL student can be integrated in Enrichment programs and additional offerings, opened to all 
students. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The following is a list of instructional materials, including technology, used to support core content and language acquisition 
among various ELL subgroups: 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

This year we will continue using Sendas Literarias and Espanol 6/ 7/ 8 in the HLA classroom, in addition to the novels Cajas de 
Carton, Lazarillo de Tormes y La casa de Mango Street. HLA teacher will continue to  work collaboratively with the ENL Team 
and participate in the Inquiry process. 
This year we will also begin implementation of new Social Studies curriculum in Spanish in the TBE program.   
We are also working in the development of a targeted after school program that will satisfy the specific needs of our various 
ELL subgroups (SIFE, ELLs taking the ELA for the first time and long term ELLs.) 
In addition, as part of the Title III Saturday program, Newcomers will be participating in a monthly trip to different destinations 
in New York City, according to their Unit of Study.  Another initiative for this school year has been the creation of two ELL-
Inquiry Teams, bringing ENL, HLA, Bilingual and Regular Education teachers together to look at ELL student's work, holding 
professional discussions on how to raise ELLs performance by appropriately scaffolding rigorous tasks and rubric-assessment 
alignment. Time has also been alloted for weekly ENL Strategies meetings for Bilingual Ed. and Regular Ed. content teachers.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

TBE Program: During the first year of transition, students receive 70% of their daily instruction in the L1. Core subjects (Social 
Studies, Science and Math) are delivered in the native language to facilitate and to advance content learning. The students also 
receive Spanish Language Arts where we emphasize reading and writing skills and strategies, taught trough a theme based 
curriculum. In core subjects like Math, textbooks and other materials are provided in the native language. 
HLA teachers were provided with aligned HLA Curriculum Map, which states the big idea of the Unit, learning standards, skills 
and strategies to be addressed in each Unit of study. The curriculum also provides an extensive list of online resources where 
teachers can access readings, videos and other visuals, and book readings in the native language. 
Additionally, HLA and ENL classrooms are equipped with a variety of language books at different reading levels, ranging from 
picture books and fairy tales through literature written by well-known Hispanic writers, such as Isabel Allende, Sandra 
Cisneros, Esmeralda Santiago and Julia Alvarez. Classical books like Don Quijote and Lazarillo de Tormes are also available for 
interested students to read.  
FESL classroom: The teaching and use of cognates is emphasized in the Spanish classroom as well as in the ESL classroom. The 
ENL and HLA Curriculum alignment allows for the direct transfer of content knowledge, vocabulary, grammar, reading and 
writing strategies. Science and Social Studies textbooks are available to students in their native language. Teachers also use 
online dictionaries to support students whose native language is less common, such as Arab and Bengali. 
   
    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Services support and resources are appropriate to grade and age levels. ENL classes are arranged by grade.  Each grade follows 
a grade level textbook. Teachers are encouraged to adapt reading resources in order to make grade level material accessible 
and comprehensible to lower proficiency students. Extra time and additional scaffolding is provided to those students who 
struggle with appropriate age/level material. Also L1 is used to prepare those students that are performing below grade level 
to manage grade level material. For example: the HLA Curriculum mocks the reading topics that the ENL beginners will 
encounter in the ENL classroom. 
    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We currently do not share resources with our co located school. We currently have enough resources and personnel to 
provide our students with the academic, linguistic and socio emotional services they need and the ones we are mandated to 
offer. We work in collaboration with a Community Organization to provide our students and their families with a strong 
socio emotional component.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).

The greatest majority of our newcomers are admitted after the first day of school.  
ELL students who are admitted into our sixth grade program by June, are invited to participate in academic Summer Program 
called Practice Makes Perfect PMP, design to strengthen students skills before the beginning of the school year and have 
them engaged in instruction during the Summer. They also have the opportunity to participate in the Invention Project and 
Robotics STEM Summer Camp, where they have the ability to interact with their future classmates other students and their 
future teachers, under a different academic light.  
Parent coordinator, Ms. Santana, and Community School Director, Ms. Feliciano, posted in our family room are in charge of 
receiving our new families and students and help them navigate the school and address questions and concerns.   Both Ms. 
Feliciano and Ms. Santana are part of our bilingual staff. If a family with a different home language needs assistant in the home 
language, they are trained to use the Over the Phone Interpretation Services. Steps to access the Language Line is posted in 
the family room. 
A Bulletin Board by the Family Room welcomes the families in different languages. Also posted  is the language poster where 
parents can indicate their language of preference. 
After parents are welcome to the school, a bilingual counselor makes herself available to assist the families with any further 
concerns.

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our school supports ongoing ENL and HLA teacher’s participation in professional development activities. In addition, all 
teachers of ELLs, participate in professional development to increase their knowledge on ELL data and linguistic needs of ELL 
students in their classroom.   
Some of the past and upcoming professional development for ENL, HLA and other teachers of ELLs include the following: 
a. "Understanding the Cultural, Linguistic and Academic Needs of Bilingual Students with Disabilities": ELA, Science, Social 
Studies, Gym, Dance and other teachers of ELLs as well as the Guidance Counsellor and Social Workers participated in this 
workshop. The main purpose was to develop understanding of the theories of social and academic language acquisition and 
how it impacts instruction.  Moreover, the workshop explored the difference between the process of second language 
acquisition and a learning disability. 
b. The use of Language Objectives in the ELA, HLA, ENL and Math Classrooms; 
c. ESL Strategies- Every week bilingual content teachers and regular education teachers of ELLs participate in in-house 
professional development, addressing the academic needs of ELLs. During the meeting, teachers watch demo lessons, discuss 
strategies they can use to make the regular education content curriculum accessible for students of varied language 
proficiency. Emphasis is placed on how to develop language and address vocabulary in content subjects.  On a weekly basis, 
teachers look at ELL data and discuss the implementation of effective ENL strategies while looking at classroom videos, and 
analysing student work.

d. Imagine Learning: Teachers learn how to interpret data generated by the research-based program and use this information 
to differentiate student support. All teachers have access to resources and training.  
e. Q-TEL- The Bilingual coach participated in a 5-day Q-TEL Institute offered by the Office of ELLs. The six Q-TEL principles 
guided the workshop, engaging participants in tasks that sustained academic rigor, held high expectations, infuse met 
processes in the education of ELLs, engaged in quality interactions and sustained a language focus. 
f. SIOP:  ENL/HLA and Science teachers of ELLs, have participated in workshops on Shelter Instruction Observation Protocol. 
The workshops provided participants with new strategies to improve the quality of instruction for ELL students. It focused on 
the eight components of the model: Teacher preparation, building background, making input comprehensible, strategies and 
interactions, application and delivery, review and assessment.  Science teacher will is preparing to turnkey the use of Language 
and content objectives in the Science classroom school-wide 
g. Differentiating for ELLs in Science, The literacy Connection: TBE/FESL/SWD Science teachers are scheduled to participate in 
this two day workshop that will engage teachers in research-based practices in the area of content literacy and differentiated 
instruction for English Language Learners. They will also be addressing the Common Core Learning Standards (Knowledge in 
the Disciplines). 
h. Integrating the Common Core Standards in the Spanish HLA Class: HLA teachers took part in this two day workshop offered 
by the OELL. This training introduced and explained the new Common Core Learning Standards and their role in the Spanish 
HLA class, as well as the necessary alignment between the instruction in HLA and the ELA classes. It focused on instructional 
strategies for integrating academic vocabulary, reading, and writing. Sample expository texts in Spanish were used to model 
reading comprehension strategies for students in grades 6-12 , including SIFE. Argumentative and narrative writing were used 
to go through writing, revising, and editing strategies. 
i. Every week ENL and HLA teachers participate in common planning meetings. This year we are aligning all common planning 
meetings. Once a month all Departments explain, discuss and address one or two components of the Danielson framework for 
teaching and the Instructional Shifts. We have addressed Domain 2 (Classroom Environment), focusing on components 2b and 
2d. We will continue the discussion on Domain 3 (Instruction), focusing on Components 3a and 3b. These discussions lead to 
teacher's self assessment, interclass visitations,  and the development of teaching improvement action plans. The third week 
of each month teachers of ESL/NLA meet to share, view, discuss and analyse ELL data, identify trends and discuss ways in 
which that data can be used to form groups and to impact individualized instruction. The last week of the month is dedicated 
to review the units of study and make curricular modifications based on the result of latest assessments. 
j. ENL/ ELA and HLA teachers have been trained by Junior Grade Books to sustain collaborative classroom discussion using the 
Shared-Inquiry Discussion Protocol. The protocol, aiming to prepare students to think critically about relevant ideas and share 
thoughts and opinions with classmates 
K. Professional Development is provided to ENL and other bilingual teachers on how to receive families and  complete the 
Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS)  
L. Additional Professional Development is provided to Pupil Accounting Secretary and ELL Liaison on relevant ELL documents, 
and how are they organized, including the HLIS, Parent Option letter, Program Placement and continued Entitlement letter.  
   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Every month the Principal and Assistant Principal review the Professional Development opportunities offered by the Office of 
English Language Learners and identifies workshops for teachers in all subject areas, that can improve the quality of instruction 
for ELLs in the classroom. Special attention is given to the offerings that help support our teachers in the implementation of 
the Common Core Learning Standards and how to scaffold complex text and rigorous tasks to make them accessible to English 
Learners. Workshops on this topic are also provided in house. 
AP's and coaches are provided in house professional development on curriculum mapping, lesson delivery, informal classroom 
observations and the design of standard-based assessments. They are also prepared to develop and implement action plans to 
help teachers who struggle in the classroom.

Through our partnership with NYS/NYC Regional Bilingual Education Resource Network,  guidance counselors and other 
related service providers receive on-going support in managing student caseload, reading and writing quality IEP’s, establishing 
academic goals with students and communicating with parents and teachers about individual specific needs and the use of the 
program SESIS. 
 
Additionally, we have created ELL Professional Learning Communities which meet twice a month to look at student work, and 
conduct a focused Study Group. The first PLC is integrated by ENL, HLA and Bilingual teachers. The second PLC is integrated by 
content-area teachers, instructing ELLs and F-ELLs. During these sessions, a cross-content group of teachers engage in the 
discussion of professional readings and learning activities designed to polish their craft, enhance their understanding of 
student learning; all leading to raise student achievement. 
 
Once a month, members of our ELL PLC's meet to look at the writing work of English Learners in all content areas. Using the 
"Protocol for Improving Teachers Practice through the Collaborative Analysis of Student Work", teachers look at the written 
work produced by a student, describe the work, make inferences about what the student's learning and make connections to 
teacher's practice. At the end of the session, presenting teachers receive the recommendations of their colleagues on how to 
improve the outcomes of his/her student. In the next session, that same teacher have the opportunity to reflect and share the 
outcomes of the recommendations. 
 
Last year, our ELL Department organized in Teachers Rounds, an Inquiry Team that identifies a problem of Practice, identifies a 
set of strategies to address the POP and evaluate the effectiveness of such strategy through the analysis of students data.  
 
All non-ENL/HLA/Bilingual teachers participates in the Mandatory Jose P training. This professional development provides 
teachers with a clearer understanding of the meaning of the term ELL and how to better support the needs of all English 
Language Learners students. Other mandatory professional development has included the presentation and discussion of 
school's ELL demographics and ESL programs; the analysis of ELL data, and ELL mandates as established by CR Part 154. The list 
of participating teachers includes all content area teachers and related service providers.  All of the records are maintained by 
the Bilingual Liaison and supervised by the Assistant Principal, Yamilette Vargas. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
1) Twice a year we offer the informational meetings for parents ELL students. We also hold an annual “Back to School Night” 
information session. These sessions are conducted in English and Spanish, since 80% of our parents are Spanish-speaking. The 
purpose of these events is to formally introduce our school staff and teachers to the families, provide an overview of the 
school, the programs that we offer our students and the promotional requirements as per Chancellor Regulations. 
2)Additionally, as part of the Title III program, we provide parents with workshops on  the expectations of the  Common Core 
Standards and the impact of the CC in the new standardized testing; how to help their children manage stress during testing 
season; how to prevent cyberbullying; problem solving and others. Due to the fact that the vast majority of our ELL families 
speak Spanish at home,  offerings are provided by bilingual staff. 
3)The third Tuesday of every month we hold our parent teacher association meeting. This meeting has increased from 30 
parents on average, to 45-60 parents attending every month. Through the PTA and the parent coordinator we host a variety of 
parents information sessions and activities to familiarize our parents with available resources and services. These activities 
range from Skedula, grade support information, technology, resume writing to understanding standardized testing. In addition, 
we promote activities to attract parents and get them involve in our school community. Some of them are: mothers day, 
father’s day and Thanksgiving luncheons and celebrations. We have a Family Room that is welcoming and accessible to and for 
all parents.  
4)All teachers are allotted one period of parent engagement a week. Teachers of ELLs use this period to meet with families and 
update parents on the language progress of their child/children.   

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 
109 

 

 

 

          

 

 

 

5) We are partners with the following organizations: ACDP Beacon; Girls INC.; Morrisana Health Clinic; Planned Parenthood, 
Creative Arts Team CAT and Manice Christodora. 
6) Skedula- Is an online teacher grade book. Each family receives a parent ID and parents can check their child’s academic, 
behavioral status and attendance. While this is not a community-based organization it is a tool that we use to communicate 
with our parents. This information is retrievable in English or Spanish. We also use this program to distribute our school-wide 
progress reports. 
7) Yearly, the school leadership team creates a parent survey to collect immediate data on what the parents needs are. 
Additionally, we use the Learning Environment Survey, to understand how parent feel about our learning community.  This 
year, 53 % of our parents returned their Survey, this represented a significant increase in parental participation compared with 
the previous year. 
Finally the Principal has an open door policy, enabling parents to meet with her upon needs.  We assess the needs of the 
parents through individual meetings, the school leadership team and through our parent’s monthly workshops.  
8) We try to ensure that when we are planning activities, they meet the needs of our parents. This is done through direct 
conversations with the parents, assessment of student’s trends, SLT parent surveys and by analyzing the learning environment 
survey as well as students' data.  
9) Teachers are allotted one period a week for Parent Engagement activities. This time is used for parent outreach  to 
coordinate and hold parental meetings. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
This year we provided our parents of ELLs, with several workshops on parenting skills.  The sessions were offered in our Family 
Room, where parents were welcomed by our Parent Coordinator and our Community Director. Activities were offered by 
bilingual - Spanish staff. These were the topics: 
In addition, all of our teachers have one period dedicated to Parent Engagement. During this period teachers of ELLs, either 
invite parents to meet personally or call parents to inform them about the language and academic progress of the students. 
These calls are logged in a Google Document.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Delise Jones, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

As a starting point, the School Leadership Team and the administrative team review the results of the Learning 
Environment Survey. Administration meets with Parent Coordinator, Madeline Santana, during monthly cabinet 
meetings, to discuss parents translation and interpretation needs. In order to maintain our families informed, we 
use a variety of methods to determine the languages other than English spoken in our school community. They 
include a review of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), the ATS Reports RHLA and the RLEC, parental 
and student's interviews, and ATS reports in which home language is indicated.  

In addition, calls made by the parent coordinator, teachers, guidance counselors and Parent Association help us 
determine language needs. To keep the lines of communication opened the school has the following methods in 
place:  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

a. Automated phone system for messages in various languages to increase parent involvement at school wide 
events.  

b. Inventory of languages taken at Parent Association meetings.  

c. Parent Teacher Conferences e. Attendance teachers' home visits.     

 

As part of the admission process, parents who can't communicate in English or Spanish are provided a Parent's 
Guide to Language Access where they are able to read and identify their language of preference. These families 
are then provided the Home Language Identification Survey in their Home Language. The ELL Liaison and Pupil 
Accounting Secretary maintain a folder with HLIS in a variety of languages, ready to provide parents access in their 
language of preference. Bilingual-Spanish pedagogues have been trained to assist parents as they complete the 
survey, and to conduct new student interviews in the home language. The parents preferred language is captured 
in the Part III of the HLIS. 

 

Traditionally, parents of students coming from various countries in Africa, and similarly, some Arab countries state 
and report that they preferred English as their language of communication. The phenomenon we have 
encountered being that parents communicate in English, even though students can not speak the English 
language. The most preferred home language after English is Spanish, with 57% or 356 parents identifying Spanish 
as their preferred language for communication.  

 

The Language poster is located by the schools primary entrance and it indicates name, email , email and phone of 
contact person. Access to translated versions of the Parent Bill of Rights and the Family Handbook is available in 
the Family room.  
 

To serve and grant access to families whose home language is not English or Spanish, we use several methods. At 
the beginning of the school year, all school staff, including Teachers, Parent Coordinator, Community Director, 
Nurse, paraprofessionals and office personnel, receives instructions on how to access Over-The-Phone 
Interpretation Services that includes the six-digit numbers to dial to access a live interpreter over the phone in the 
parent's home language. In addition, based on the RCPL report, at the end of the school year, the school hires 
language interpreters who are present during graduation and using the automated system, provide parents access 
to the graduation ceremony. Last year at graduation, we had interpreters for families speaking Spanish, Bengali 
and Arab, providing parents the opportunity to participate  

 

Teachers, Deans, Administrators and administrative personal have access to students blue card. Staff is 
encouraged to consult blue card and make an effort to communicate with parent in the preferred language stated 
in this document, by either reaching out to a staff member who can act as an interpreter of by accessing the Over 
-the -Phone Interpreter services.

According to the RHLA ATS report, 91% of our ELL families speak Spanish at home. Other languages spoken by our 
families and students include Arabic, French, Mandinka and Twi. We have been successful in facilitating written 
and oral communications to satisfy the language translation and interpretation needs in Spanish, but we still need 
additional resources in languages other than Spanish. Language related findings are discussed during SLT 
meetings, LAP meetings, PTA and Cabinet meetings. 

  

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In case of a school wide emergency, the school has several strategies to reach families that cannot communicate in 
English: 

1. We will use the Automated System Phone service to communicate with all families, including those with different 
home language. This phone system provides for messages to be voice recorded and send automatically to parents at 
their contact number. The system also allows for messages to be written in any language. This messages are then 
voice recorded and sent to parents and families.  

2. Another tool we have in place to communicate with parents in various languages, in case of an emergency, is the 
real-time messaging system named Remind. Though this system, a text message is composed in English and it is 
automatically translated to the desired language, including Spanish, Arabic, French, Estonian and Housa and sent to 
families. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of the CR A-663 in several ways: 

 

1. A Summary of the Chancellor's Regulation A-663 is included in the Staff Handbook, distributed to staff members at 
the beginning of the school year. Discussion of the Regulation's goals, compliance aspects and parents rights are 
discussed during staff meetings. 

2. During Academy and cabinet meetings, staff is informed about translation and interpretation resources available, 
including the Over-The Phone Interpreter Services, the phone number and the schools access code. Flyer is distributed 
to all staff and posted in the main office, guidance counsellors, Deans and Nurses office.  

3. Language Access Coordinator ensures language cards are accessible to parents upon entrance to school and 
administrative assistants posted in the main office as well as personnel posted in the receiving family room is trained 
on how to help a parent who can not communicate in the English language.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

We ensure that parents speaking a language other than English feel welcome in our school community in several 
ways. 

 

1. A Welcome bulletin board located at the main school entrance greets parents in several languages. A Language 
poster is posted by the family room, where the Parent Coordinator and the Community Director receive families on a 
daily basis. The Parent's Guide to Language Access is readily available in the family room. The Language card is placed 
on the counter in the main office. 

2. Copies of the Parent's Bill of Rights in English, Spanish and French are also available in the Family Room, located in 
room 107. 

2. Language Access Coordinator has distributed parents Guides to all staff and offices. 

3. In order to provide language services to all parents who require assistance, we have identified key personnel to 
serve as interpreters between parents and pedagogues in need. 

4. Language ID Guides has been placed in different places in the building, so they are accessible to parents and staff. 
Cards can be found at the main entrance (where the safety agents are posted); the main office and the Family Room. 
They have been also distributed to teachers and paraprofessionals. 

5. During initial Orientation, parents of ELLs are informed of their right to receive all school information and 
notifications in their home language. In addition, they are notified that interpretation services are available for them 
at the school site, whenever needed.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

By the end of December, the Parent Coordinator in Partnership with The Community Director will conduct the first 
Language Services Survey. This in house tool will help us determine how effectively are we communicating with 
parents in terms of the quality and availability of Language Services in the school. The survey will also informed us 
about how can we improve/ expand language services to better service our diverse language population. In order to 
track improvement on language. The same survey will be conducted in June.
