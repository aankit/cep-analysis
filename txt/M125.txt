Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S. 125-- The Ralph Bunche School’s goal is to provide a strong career and college preparatory program from which 
each student will develop a personal commitment to learning, a respect for independent thinking, an expanding 
curiosity about the world and its people, and value diversity to become responsible world citizens. We are dedicated 
to helping young people make bold and valuable decisions with their lives while acting as a force for positive social 
change.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 125--The Ralph Bunche School is a community in which each administrator, teacher, student, parent and support 
staff member is expected to be an active participant in a lifelong journey of learning, and our unique PK-5 program is 
built on a progressive, developmental model of education. To this end, we are committed to academic excellence, the 
arts, the greater community, the development of a student population of social, economic, and racial diversity, and the 
development of each student’s physical well-being and full human potential. 

 

As a career and college preparatory school, we believe in the importance of academic success, inclusive of a child’s 
emotional and social well-being; this is best achieved in a caring, student-centered environment. 

 

In our progressive approach, we believe that education must not be a race for the accumulation of facts, but should be 
an enriching end in itself. We also believe that education is a joint venture among students, parents/caregivers and 
teachers.  We  see  the  individual  child’s  curiosity,  abilities  and  learning  styles  as  integral  factors  in  designing, 
individualizing and assessing each student’s learning. We believe that the arts are an essential part of the curriculum 
and that it is important for students to express themselves creatively and to use their imaginations freely. We believe 
that the uniqueness of children is revealed in their very existence and that it is the school’s responsibility to foster their 
innate sense of the mystery and joy of life. 

 

We encourage children to follow their interests, pursue problems in a way that makes sense to them and defend their 
conclusion by explaining their thinking a variety of ways. We understand that there are many kinds of intelligence and 
the traditional academic, cognitive area is one. Other important areas of intelligence are intuition, imagination, artistic 
creativity, physical expression and performance, sensitivity to others, and self-understanding. To neglect any of these 
areas is to limit students in the development of their full human potential. 

 

We engage students with hands-on investigations, projects and design challenges across the grades and subject areas 
inspiring greater interest, depth and understanding. Our approach values the skills involved in formulating one’s own 
questions, as well as answering those of a teacher. We view mistakes and setbacks as important opportunities for both 
learning and assessment. 

 

We believe each child learns best not by reliance on summative testing or passively consuming knowledge, rather that 
each  child  learns  best  by  actively  constructing  their  own  understanding  based  on  his  or  her  knowledge,  skills,  and 
experience. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

In the 21st Century, students are faced with the challenge of learning about an interconnected world where knowledge 
is constantly developing. Students in Ralph Bunche School classrooms have their understanding of beliefs, facts, and 
skills deepened and reinforced by applying them to complex real-world situations. 

 

We have a collaboration with several colleges from which we receive student teachers/interns, i.e. Columbia University 
Teachers College, City College of New York, and Borough of Manhattan Community College. We work closely with a 
number of community based organizations, i.e. Harlem Grown, West Harlem Development Corporation, The Boys and 
Girls Club of Harlem, Columbia University Office of Community Impact. 

 

Teachers participate in professional development activities in a number of institutes, i.e., Columbia University Teachers 
College, Bank Street College, and Borough of Manhattan Community College. We also have an ongoing collaboration 
and instructional program through the Borough of Manhattan Community College-Kellogg Foundation Grant. 

 

We are committed to implementing an Inquiry Based Learning Model throughout  the grades. We use the Teachers 
College Reading and Writing approach to literacy including the use of fiction and non-fiction books, periodicals, primary 
sources and documents. We use Investigations in Math (K – 2) and Go Math ( 3 – 5). Our science Program uses a hands-
on, inquiry-based approach. An inquiry-based approach is also used for instruction to meet Common Core Standards. 
We are beginning our work with performance-based learning and authentic assessments, as well as with the Danielson 
Framework  toward  teacher  effectiveness.  We  will  to  continue  growing  and  continuing  more  in  depth  work  in  this 
initiative.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The Ralph Bunche School is a long-time educational center serving southwest Harlem and Morningside Heights. Our 
school’s location makes it a “melting-pot” of cultures that we use to celebrate and enhance our children’s experiences. 
We are at the crossroads of the traditional Harlem, which includes Grant and Manhattanville Houses, and Columbia 
University  and  its  environs.  The  school  serves  diverse  learners  including  English  Language  Learners,  Students  with 
Disabilities and Students in Temporary Housing. 

 

Who are English Language Learners (ENLs)? 

ENLs are students who speak a language other than English at home and testing indicates these students have some 
limitations in their English language abilities.  

 

How are ENLs identified? 

All  incoming  families  to  the  school  are  required  to  complete  a  Home  Language  Survey  as  part  of  their  registration 
process. If it is indicated that a language other than English is spoken at home, a qualified staff member will conduct an 
informal interview in English and in the family’s native language to decide if a formal English assessment should be 
administered. The results of the assessment determine if the student is entitled to receive English as a New Language 
(ENL) services and will determine the level of English language support. The results will also help teachers plan the best 
program for the student based on his or her strengths and needs in listening, speaking, reading, and writing in English.  

 

What are the English proficiency levels and what do they mean? 

New York State identifies English Language Learners at five levels of proficiency: 

  Entering (Beginner)-- The student has great dependence on supports and structures to advance his or her 

academic language skills and has yet to meet the linguistic demands necessary to demonstrate English 
language proficiency in a variety of academic contexts within this grade level. 

  Emerging (low Intermediate) --The student has some dependence on supports and structures to advance his 
or her academic language skills and has yet to meet the linguistic demands necessary to demonstrate English 
language proficiency in a variety of academic contexts within this grade level. 

  Transitioning (high Intermediate) --The student shows some independence in advancing his or her academic 
language skills, but has yet to meet the linguistic demands necessary to demonstrate English proficiency in a 
variety of academic contexts within this grade level. 

  Expanding (Advanced)--The student shows great independence in advancing his or her academic language 
skills and is approaching the linguistic demands necessary to demonstrate English language proficiency in a 
variety of academic contexts within this grade level.

  Commanding (Proficient)--The student has attained a near-native level of proficiency in academic language 

skills and demonstrates proficiency in a variety of academic contexts within the grade level 

How often are ENL students serviced? 

Students are provided with English language services based on their proficiency levels. A combination of Integrated 
ENL (Co-teaching) and Stand-Alone ENL programs are utilized depending on a student’s English proficiency.  

 

 

Integrated ENL: Students receive core content area and English language development instruction including 
home language supports and appropriate ELL scaffolds. 
Stand-alone ENL: Students receive English language development instruction taught by a NYS certified ESOL 
teacher in order to acquire the English language needed for success in core content areas.  

Who receives Special Class Services? 

Special Class Services are designed for students requiring specialized/specially designed instruction that cannot be 
met in the general education classroom with supplementary aids and services. Students are grouped for special class 
services based upon the similarity of educational needs. Classes may be composed of students with the same 
disability or with different disabilities but with similar education needs. 

Special Class Staffing Ratio 12:1:1 

• no more than twelve (12) students per class 

• one full-time special education teacher 

• one full-time paraprofessional Serves students whose academic and/or behavioral management needs interfere 
with the instructional process, to the extent that additional adult support is needed to engage in learning and who 
require specialized/specially designed instruction which can best be accomplished in a self-contained setting. 

 

Who receives Related Services? 

Related Services Based upon a student's needs and the extent to which those needs affect educational performance, 
the  IEP  Team  may  recommend  that  related  services  be  provided.  Related  Services  are  defined  as  "developmental, 
corrective and other support services" required to assist a student with a disability to benefit from instruction. They are 
intended to assist the student in meeting the objectives of his or her instructional program, to be involved in the general 
education curriculum, to experience success in his or her classroom setting and to be educated with nondisabled peers. 
When Related Services are provided to students whose primary program is general education they are considered a 
supplementary aid and service. 

 

Related Services may also be a support for students in special classes. Related Services may include counseling; hearing 
education services; occupational therapy (OT); orientation and mobility services; physical therapy (PT); school health 
services;  speech/language  therapy;  vision  education  services  and  other  support  services.  Each  related  service  is 
described in detail on the following pages. 

 

Who receives Special Education Teacher Support Services? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

Special Education Teacher Support Services combines the services of Consultant Teacher and Resource Room and 
provides: 

 

• Specially designed and/or supplemental instruction to support the participation of the student with a disability in 
the general education classroom. 

• Consultation to the student's general education teacher. These services are designed to be flexible, helping students 
to remain in the general education classroom and utilize the combined expertise of both the general and special 
education teacher. They may be provided within the general education classroom or in a separate location. 

 

The Special Education Teacher Support Services provided may be all direct, or a combination of direct and indirect. The 
student's IEP must indicate the amount of time the student will receive Special Education Teacher Support Services, the 
distribution of the time between direct and indirect services and the location of services (i.e. the general education 
classroom or a separate location). Group size for the provision of Special Education Teacher Support Services provided 
in the general education classroom or in a separate location may not exceed a maximum of eight students.  

 

Who are Students in Temporary Housing? 

Children living in the following situations are considered homeless for the purposes of education rights under the 
McKinney-Vento Act: 

 

In a shelter, transitional shelter, motel, campground, abandoned in a hospital, or awaiting foster care 
placement. 
In a car, park, public place, bus, train or abandoned building. 

 
  Doubled up with friends or relatives because you cannot find or afford housing. 

 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Strong Family-Community Ties  

School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by welcoming, encouraging, and 
developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 

 

Trust  

Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school and 
beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value each 
other. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

 

The most progress made over the last year was the strengthening of parents and families that have historically lived in 
the  community  and  those  that  are  new  to  the  school  and  West  Harlem  community.  Parents  bring  a  wealth  of 
information  to  a  school  based  on  their  experiences.  For  example,  the  “traditional  stakeholders”  understand  the 
challenges of living in West Harlem, public housing and raising a family in an economically challenged environment. On 
the other  hand, the  “new  stakeholders”  have  advanced  degrees,  and  are  raising  children  in  an economically  stable 
environment. Individual teachers and different parent groups, of course, have their own particular areas of knowledge, 
but a group of teacher and parent leaders can supply the variety of professional knowledge needed for sustained school 
improvement. Given these factors, P.S. 125’s school improvement depended more than ever on the active involvement 
of all teachers and all parent leaders from traditional and new stakeholders.  

 

Collaborative Teachers  

Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity 
to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

The focus for this year is the continued implementation of the school’s progressive approach to teaching and learning. 
This work will be supported by the faculty of BMCC.

BMCC received a grant through the Kellogg Foundation that will help support the vision of the P.S. 125 teachers and 
administration to become “a progressive, pre-K to fifth-grade school using a child-centered, best practices curriculum. 

 

The Kellogg-funded  project,  “will  provide  hands-on  training  for  BMCC  Teacher Education  students, who  will  do  site 
visits,  observe  classrooms  and  as  part  of  their  final  semester  fieldwork  complete  an  action  research  project  in  the 
classroom in which they have been interning” Garte says. “To support the school’s ongoing efforts and ensure that the 
most effective child centered practices characterize curriculum and instruction throughout PS 125, the faculty in BMCCs 
teacher education department will provide a three year professional development program for the teachers at PS 125. 
The program is being developed in collaboration with the school’s administration and model teachers and will include 
workshops, coaching and curriculum development support.”

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

The  School  Leadership  Team  looked  at  the  data-results  on  summative  assessments;  New  York  State  Mathematics 
Assessment for Grades 3 – 5, results of the New York City Mathematics Performance Tasks and reviewed findings of the 
school’s Teacher Teams. We determined that, while our school is showing both general performance and individual 
student progress worthy of an excellent rating, we need to ensure sustainability of school performance and student 
growth and need to ensure the progress of a (small) percentage of students who are not meeting the standards and/or 
not  showing  sufficient  gains. Students,  individually, and collectively struggle with grappling mathematical ideas  and 
relationships as evidenced by their performance on the constructed response questions. 

 

Areas for Growth 

  5NF.B.6 Solve real world problems involving multiplication of fractions and mixed numbers, e.g., by using 

visual fraction models or equations to represent the problem. 

  4OA.A.2 Use the four operations with whole numbers to solve problems. Multiply or divide to solve word 
problems involving multiplicative comparison, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the 
unknown number to represent the problem, distinguishing multiplicative comparison from additive 
comparison. 

  4OA.A.3 Use the four operations with whole numbers to solve problems. Solve multi-step word problems 

posed with whole numbers and having whole-number answers using the four operations, including problems 
in which remainders must be interpreted. Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing 
for the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation 
strategies including rounding. 

  3OA.A.2 Represent and solve problems involving multiplication and division. Interpret whole-number 

quotients of whole numbers, e.g., interpret 56 ÷ 8 as the number of objects in each share when 56 objects are 
partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when 56 objects are partitioned into equal shares 
of 8 objects each. For example, describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be 
expressed as 56 ÷ 8. 

  3OA.A.3 Represent and solve problems involving multiplication and division. Use multiplication and division 
within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities, 
e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.  

  3OA.D.8 Solve problems involving the four operations, and identify and explain patterns in arithmetic. 

Solve two-step word problems using the four operations. Represent these problems using equations with a

letter standing for the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation 
and estimation strategies including rounding. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

By June 2019 70% of (3rd - 5th grade ) students will show at least one year’s growth on the Performance Series 
in their ability to solve problems and express solutions both orally and in writing. Students will thus demonstrate 
deep understanding of mathematics and transfer problem-solving strategies and skills to all content areas and 
everyday life.

Through professional development and Inquiry Team work, consultation with the UFT Chapter Leader and Committee, 
Instructional  Team,  PD  Team,  MOSL  Committee  and  Coach,  Lead  Teachers,  grade  teams  and  formal  and  informal 
meetings with teachers, we will plan professional development which supports the faculty in accessing and using data, 
including results on the NYS Math Assessment, i-Ready, IXL, and Performance Series and student work samples and 
observation of classroom performance, which gives teachers the opportunity to inform decisions regarding the use of 
academic  assessments  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  strategies/activities  by  January  2018  and  in  personal, 
professional growth, as well as in the refinement of general teaching practices aligned with implementation of Core 
Curriculum/Standards. 

 

By January 2019 50% of (3rd - 5th grade ) students will show at least one year’s growth on the Performance Series in 
their ability to solve problems and express solutions both orally and in writing. Students will thus demonstrate deep 
understanding of mathematics and transfer problem-solving strategies and skills to all content areas and everyday life.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Based on the data from the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey, 85% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the adults at 
their school help students develop the skills they need to complete challenging coursework despite obstacles. (Q20a) 
P.S. 125—The Ralph Bunche School believes that when students’ social and emotional states are in balance they will 
demonstrate an improvement of their academic performance. We want a school community where students are feeling 
nurtured and experience high levels of self-esteem and educators demonstrate compassionate corrective interventions. 
The academic and emotional needs of our students and our families are an ongoing challenge and our mental health 
supporters provide consistent support that enables many of our students to develop strategies to cope with the stress 
that accompany many of their lives. 

 

Sixty-eight percent of our students come from families that live below the poverty line. We recognize that establishing 
and  maintaining  a  safe,  collaborative,  positive  school  community  —  from  classrooms  to  the  playground  –  is  the 
foundational quality to teaching and learning. Bank Street College’s Emotionally Responsive Practice Curriculum is the 
approach we use to consistently align social, emotional and academic learning. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of staff will participate in professional development in emotionally responsive techniques. 
Working with Bankstreet College the school will implement an emotionally responsive approach in order to create a 
school environment in which staff, children and their families recognize consistent expectations and protocols for 
problem solving that will allow them to feel safe and supported in their classrooms, with their peers, and with all staff 
in the school.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on the data from the 2017-018 NYC School Survey, 85% of of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that, at their 
school, teachers design instructional programs (e.g. lessons, units) together. (Q8a) 

 

We will implement two student influenced/teacher guided inquiry-based units of study as a means of supporting the 
collaborative environment of the school and classrooms. There will be continued professional development for teachers 
to create  multiple entry  points on all levels  for our students (differentiation of instruction). Further engagement  of 
students will give them multiple opportunities to help develop and create the units of study. We will discuss the CCLS 
with  students,  and through  the  inquiry-based  units of  study  engage  the  students  in making  choices,  thus  nurturing 
independence from the early grades. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By  June  2019,  100%  of  all  classrooms  will  reflect  inquiry-based,  project-oriented  and  differentiated  instruction,  in 
accordance  with  assessed  needs,  abilities/strengths  and  interests  and  in  accordance  with  Common  Core  Curriculum. 
Students will collaboratively produce at least 2 projects per study that will have evidence of research, via use of technology 
and primary resources, interdisciplinary learning, and will include a medium of art and oral performance as measured by 
the 2018 NYC School Survey where teachers agreed or strongly agreed that, at their school, teachers design instructional 
programs (e.g. lessons, units) together.

From the onset of the school year, teachers will conduct 
assessment and planning for differentiation. Inquiry-based, 
project-oriented activities and differentiated instruction will 
commence at the onset of the school year and continue 
throughout the year. Activities will reflect strengths, interests 
and needs of students. Students will be engaged in organized 
activities for student leadership. Student “Teams” will have input 
on decisions regarding instructional programs, goal-setting, 
school environment and nutrition and which will serve to help 
students make connections and engage in problem-solving and

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
 

Teacher  planning  of  in-depth  studies,  learning  goals,  student  activities  and  assessment  will  reflect  the  professional 
development that has been on-going all school year. Students will produce research projects based on their interest 
and  which  will  reflect  differentiation.  Topics  covered  within  the  studies  will  be  aligned  to  the  Standards  while 
incorporating  student  input.  By  January  2019  ,  classrooms  will  be  embarking  on  their  second  in-depth  study.  The 
activities and learning goals will reflect differentiation and student input. Students will be able to articulate the learning 
goals of their particular study. Planning will reflect grade goals, sharing of resources and best practices. This will be 
accomplished through common planning time and professional development that will be built into the school day and 
during professional development time. 

 

By January 2019, 60% of all classrooms will reflect inquiry-based, project-oriented and differentiated instruction, in 
accordance with assessed needs, abilities/strengths and interests and in accordance with Common Core Curriculum as 
measured by feedback generated from ADVANCE observation reports.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on the data from the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey, 92% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that at their 
school it is clear how all of the programs offered are connected to their school's instructional vision. (Q8f) 
 

In order to build trust and lead by example the principal will engage in professional development alongside teachers to 
develop his leadership capacity. Professional development will be structured with input from the different committees 
within  the  school.  The  principal  will  conduct  classroom  observations  and  engage  in  immediate  feedback  using  the 
Framework of Teaching as the common language of these conversations. The principal will also support the teachers 
by allowing for flexible scheduling to facilitate grade planning and professional development. The principal will adhere 
to an observation schedule in order to provide follow-up support to all teachers.  

 

The cultivation of leadership in other is one of the five key practices of an effective school principal. As a result, the 
principal will enhance his leadership capacity by developing distributive leadership structures. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers at their end of the year evaluation will be able to discuss their professional growth and 
to  discuss  their  next  steps  for  continued  professional  growth.  Teachers  who  were  developing  and  effective,  with  the 
support of mentors  and administration will move  up to highly effective  and effective. The evidence of growth will be 
measured  through  teacher  observations  based  on  the  Danielson  Framework.  Developing  teachers  will  reach 
effective/highly effective and effective teachers will reach highly effective. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
Principal, Teachers, the Parent Coordinator and PA leaders will conduct surveys to gain input from families, and they 
will work with agencies, CBO’s to plan workshops and other activities for parents throughout the school year, including 
on how families can support their children. Numerous activities will be planned throughout the year in which parents 
and students work together in the classroom and outside of the classroom, i.e. learning celebrations and occasions. 

 

There will be Parent Orientations across grades and multiple opportunities for parents to visit and observe classrooms. 
There  will  be  flexible  scheduling  to  support  Parent  Teacher  Conferences.  Translation  services  for  families  will  be 
provided. 

 

Parents will be trained on the Common Core Standards, Danielson Framework for Teaching, and the instructional shifts 
during SLT meetings, PA meetings and First Fridays: Parents as Partners, so that they can better understand how to 
support students at home. Parents will receive monthly grade specific newsletters and weekly “Email Blasts” that detail 
units of study in Reading, Writing, Math, Science and Social Studies and school events. Our website is updated monthly 
to include activities that parents can use at home with their children.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Presently, P.S. 125—The Ralph Bunche School, in Harlem, is the #1 elementary school in District 5 based on 2016 – 2017 
NYS test scores in ELA and math; we continue to show growth even though many of our higher level performing students 
are being recruited by local charter schools. While this makes it easier for us to work and act as a family, there are some 
challenges. Since school funding is almost wholly based upon student population, we receive  less money when our 
student enrollment declines. In turn, there are fewer funds to enhance students’ education and experiences. The most 
noticeable  effect  of a smaller budget is that we have fewer resources. Therefore,  integrating new families into our 
school allows the school to offer a well-rounded education for all students.  

 

At P.S. 125—The Ralph Bunche School we are piloting a progressive, early childhood program with the intention of 
becoming a PK – 5 progressive school by 2020. We are focused on working with all family members to plan intentional 
activities that promote building bridges across racial, social and economic lines.  

 

In arriving at this point, we have visited independent progressive schools in NYC, where strong students are challenged 
and more dependent students get the extra support they need to be successful via learning specialists on staff and 
outside, private tutors.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, an average of 25% of the families that reside in Grant Houses at P.S. 125—The Ralph Bunche School will 
participate in school-wide events as measured by analyzing attendance sheets collected at each event.

● To communicate whenever feasible with non-English speaking  
parents in their home language in order to support shared parent-school accountability, parent access to information 
about their children’s educational options, and parents’ capacity to improve their children’s achievement. 
Parent-to-Parent Conversations Parent leaders (PA Executive Board, SLT parent representatives, class parents) will 
engage in one-on-one meetings and conversations with parents at least 3 times during the year, including during 
family engagement time and parent-teachers conferences. The objective of these meetings will be to supplement the 
data collected by the surveys and to develop personal relationships with as many families as possible in a specific goal 
to increase the level of trust between our school and its families.

Monthly Workshops The SLT will offer parents, 6 monthly workshops to be held starting in January and ending in June 
2015. The topics of the workshops will include Literacy, Math and Behavior Support. For each topic we will offer two 
workshops in order to measure effectiveness and impact, so that if needed a different strategy can be implemented. 
These grade-specific workshops will be facilitated by content experts, with knowledge of our school specific needs 
and culture. They will be designed to be inclusive of diverse learners in our community. The target will be all families 
and their structure will be informed by the data collected through surveys and individual conversations. The program 
will be overseen by the SLT and the PA Executive Board. Additional workshops for families of ELLs and students with 
disabilities.

Directions: Schools need to maintain accurate records of students who are receiving Academic Intervention Services 
(AIS) to ensure that students who are not achieving proficiency receive effective and timely assistance. These records 
need to be made available upon request and indicate the total number of students receiving AIS in each subject area 
listed below and for each applicable grade in your school.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

 

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

33 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

  Make the new student a file that includes things to send home to parents (i.e., school rules, classroom rules, 

lunchroom rules, class schedule, and a list of special classes). 

  Provide well-defined transition procedures from one activity to another. 
  Plan ahead whenever possible, inform students ahead of time about substitute teachers and changes in 

activities. This will foster a sense of safety and security. 

  Coordinate any educational plan with the school counselor. 
  Expect and unobtrusively monitor regressions. 
  Offer encouragement and understanding and recognize the child’s talents and accomplishments. Give 
students the opportunity to see some of their experiences as positive (e.g., places they have traveled). 

  Allow personal possessions and keep in mind that any possession may be the child’s only one. 
  Give choices when appropriate to counter the loss of control experienced in their lives. 
  Don’t penalize students who are homeless for being late before finding out if they have reliable 

transportation and an alarm clock. 

  Assign projects that can be broken into small components to ensure students have at least some success. The 

experience of mastery is critical to their self-image. 

  Maintain the child’s privacy and discuss homework situations away from other classmates. Give the student a 

clipboard to take home as a portable desk to work on. 

  Avoid TV assignments (students living in shelters may not be able to make the channel choices for their 

 

group). 
Show sensitivity when asking children to bring food, photographs, favorite toys, or other items from home. 
Children who are homeless are often embarrassed to admit that they do not have these things. Avoid taking 
away recess/gym class as a disciplinary consequence. (This may be the only time students who are homeless 
have space to run.) Children are often without an adequate play area at shelters or in the streets. 

  Don’t assume younger students know how to play. They may have to be taught how to do so. 
  Help the child participate in field trips, school activities, and class projects through understanding of her/his 
living environment and access to resources. Arrange school picture fees so children who are homeless may 
have pictures too. 

  Ensure that children in homeless situations have easy access to assistance in case of personal difficulties (i.e., 
counselors). Allow students to express fears and frustrations and allow opportunities to do so in other ways in 
addition to verbalizing (i.e., drawing). Help children find positive outlets for anger. 

  Help children take an active role in their life. A sense of empowerment is critical to overcoming helplessness 

(i.e., make child a helper in class, have the child tutor a younger child, promote activities they are good at).

Introduction to Universal Design for Learning 

Principal[Refer to Section 5d Effective School Leadership] 

Common  Core  Library  and  Engage  NY  are  a  one‐stop  shop  for  high‐quality  professional  development  resources  for 
school leaders that can be accessed side‐by‐side with student data and instructional resources. School leaders can use 
the  Common  Core  Library  and  Engage  NY  to  explore  the  School  Leadership  Competencies,  take  self‐assessments, 
develop and reflect on learning plans, and find on‐line learning opportunities to build school leader effectiveness and 
ultimately improve student achievement. School leader competencies define the skills, knowledge and behaviors of 
effective educators. These research-based competencies offer a roadmap for continued professional growth. They are 
designed to: 

 

 

 

  Provide a common language and understanding of what effective practice looks like 

 

Identify key skills needed to successfully teach, lead effective schools and increase student achievement 

 

Serve as a foundation for a comprehensive talent management system that aligns recruitment, selection, 
training, evaluation, and ongoing support of educators 

The NYCDOE School Leadership Competencies were developed based on: 

Research about high‐performing schools and principal effectiveness 

Best practices from across the country including competency models specifically related to school leadership as well as 
other competency models, input from current and former high‐performing principals, and feedback from those who

The School Leadership Competencies are: 

  Personal Leadership 
  Data 
  Curriculum and Instruction 
 
  Resources and Operations 

Staff and Community 

School leader competencies can be explored under the “Competencies” Tab. 

Learn  provides  school  leaders  and  teachers  with  on-demand  resources  to  help  deepen  their  understanding  of 
competencies from Danielson’s Framework through interactive modules, podcasts, video examples, articles, websites 
and other materials. These resources are searchable by competency, grade band, and content area, and are grouped in 
“Learning Opportunities” that provide framing and context to maximize the usefulness of the resources for users. School 
Leaders  will  also  find  resources  related  to  conducting  more  frequent  cycles  of  classroom  observation,  work  with 
teachers to examine student work, and provide high-quality feedback. 

Paraprofessionals 

The Division of Students with Disabilities and English Language Learners (SWDs/ELLs) is supporting special education 
initiatives with its new professional development registration site. Sessions are open to all DOE educators, including 
school  leaders,  general  and  special  education  teachers,  paraprofessionals  and  related  service  providers.  October

P.S. 125—The Ralph Bunche School is committed to assisting families with pre-school children from early childhood 
programs to the elementary school program. Families will experience warmth and respect from P.S. 125—The Ralph 
Bunche School program staff, demonstrated by the collaborative tone of school staff in the school’s policies, protocols 
and offerings that are sensitive to a family’s linguistic, cultural and social emotional needs. Families are viewed as 
partners in supporting children’s readiness for the next grade through mutual expectation sharing, and joint-decision 
making with the school around policy decision and program evaluation. Families will have the opportunity to support 
and extend their children’s classroom learning and development at home with the assistance of complimentary 
learning activities shared with families regularly. Families will experience multiple methods of communication 
between themselves and the pre-k program throughout the school year. Families will be equipped with the resources 
and skills to support their children through their transition into and out of the school, as demonstrated by school 
policy, and ongoing, meaningful discussions between school staff and families. P.S. 125-The Ralph Bunche School 
offers opportunities for early grade families and children to visit the school in advance of the school year to ease the 
anxiety of the transition to a new place. The school partners with local community based organizations such as 
Columbia University’s Community Impact Office to create a child friendly transition plan for students arriving from 
early childhood settings. P.S. 125—The Ralph Bunche School provides a thoughtful, developmentally appropriate 
transition plan from pre-kindergarten to kindergarten for children and families. 
 
The Pre-K teachers and parents will be provided with the opportunity to review and discuss the K curriculum and 
Common Core standards with the K teachers in an April 2019 informational meeting.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy  is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S.125 - The Ralph Bunche School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the  school and the families. The 
school’s  policy  is  designed  to  keep  parents  informed  by  actively  involving  them  in  planning  and  decision-making  in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
P.S. 125—The Ralph Bunche School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;

Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 



After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The curriculum-embedded assessments that are being used at PS 125 are  the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Programs 
(TCWP). Teachers assess the early literacy skills of our Ells by administering various assessments such as high frequency words, 
letter/sound identification and running records. Spelling inventories, comprehension tasks, critical thinking and on-demand 
writing samples tasks are also provided to the ELLs. Once the teachers obtain the results of the formative assessments, they 
create differentiated and appropriate instructional plans for all students, including ELLs. Our lesson plans follow the formats of 
UDL, including language objectives. Additionally, we use Fountas and Pinell with Baseline and Running Records assessments. 
 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

Teachers participate in cyclical data talks with the school administration. Additionally, they provide differentiated, targeted 
instruction to address the students' areas of need or difficulties.The ENL teacher and monolingual teachers collaborate to plan 
for instruction for all students on a weekly basis. When  unable to meet, teachers email their lesson plans in advance to the 
ENL teacher so she  can adapt them and provide ENL strategies to reach the various learning modalities. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The Ralph Bunche uses the summative assessments or baseline/benchmark, NYC performance Tasks, Perfomance Series and 
ELL Periodic Assessment, NYSESLAT, ELA and math to evaluate the success of our programs for ELLs. Areas of need and 
students' progress are measured  based on the results of these assessments. The data is utilized to inform planning and 
instruction. it further allows us to address the students' needs with differentiated instruction. Students' progress is measured 
by  the  significant gains that they make on the assessments. We consistently reevaluate how instruction is delivered and make 
adaptations to reach the students' areas of need or weaknesses. The identified areas of their weaknesses are reading, writing 
and academic vocabulary development. For the lower grades, teachers focus on building decoding and fluency as well as 
comprehension skills and reading skills. 
 
Based on the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT and Fall 2017 NYSITELL results, the Ralph Bunche School has 1 Entering student, 3 
Newcomers at the Expanding level, and 2 Emerging ELLs. There is a need for continuous improvement of  comprehension, 
reading and writing skills.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

PS 125 holds Teacher Teams' meetings to analyze the results and create action plans based on the summative data. We share 
best practiced strategies to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered. A professional development 
team  provides workshops focusing on students' writing in all content areas, using questioning and accountable talks to 
address reading and writing. Effective lesson planning  writing workshops are also provided to address the four language 
modalities of the students.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 125 has implemented a "Response to Intervention" RTI programs for the students who are designated at risk to prevent the 
Committee on Special Education's referral.  The three Tiers of Instructional Support are used: Core of Instruction (Tier I), 
Double Doze  of Instruction (Tier II) and Intensive Intervention (Tier III) to address the students literacy and mathematical 
deficiencies. Tier I and II needs are addressed in the classroom. Tier III students who necessitate the most support receive an 
enriched instructional and activities are reinforced on a daily basis outside of the classroom. 
 
We provide our Tier I students with an effective instruction and differentiation to meet their diverse needs including UDL 
lessons, language objectives, targeted group activities, leveled libraries and other resources. We move our ELLs to Tier II and III 
if they need a more intensive academic support and a targeted one through small group instruction. Tier II and Tier III are 
geared to meet the demands of the language needs of the ELLs. and focus on research-based strategies. 
 
The Ralph Bunche School uses Fundations in order to meet the most critical needs of each student. We continue to assess 
whether the instruction/intervention is effective enough in order to assist the achievement of our students throughout the 
academic school year.      
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSESLAT, ELA  and Math data are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs. The administration and teachers 
utilize EDAT and its filtering functions to dig deeper to inform programs. Additionally, we access at- risk indicators to 
determine needs of specific students in planning programming. 
 
After reviewing the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data (first year students), our findings indicate that reading and writing modalities 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

pose a greater challenge for the students.  Students acquire listening and speaking skills more rapidly than reading and writing 
skills.  However, they still require more opportunities for academic discussions in order to develop academic language. 
Students require Title III after-school programs to assist them with homework and acquisition of English. 
. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teacher Teams' meetings and staff development sessions are held in place to disseminate these findings in order to make 
adjustments to our programs.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The Freestanding ENL program includes both stand-alone and integrated delivery models. instruction is provided to 
students using an integrated approach in which the ENL provider and the general education teachers co-teach inside 
the classroom in order for the ELLs to receive content instruction and mandated ENL support in order to meet grade-
level standards. Students are grouped together according to grade level and mixed proficiency level. Following the co-
teaching model permit the ENL teacher, the monolingual and content area teachers  to meet and extend the students' 
mandated required integrated ENL minutes . The program delivered includes content area subject matter and English 
language development using ENL strategies. The integrated ENL model builds English language skills through content 
instruction. This allows for language acquisition to occur and academic vocabulary to be built . We provide all our ELLs 
(Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding) with a Balanced Literacy Model. realia, visuals, bilingual glossaries 
and native language libraries to promote comprehensible input and to lower the Affective Filter and provide English 
language development growth. There is also a Stand-alone ENL program geared specifically for Entering students.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 
The Ralph Bunche School ensures that all teachers  are appropriately certified or licensed. The RLAT report is reviewed to 
ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels.Students are grouped 
for differentiated instruction based on grade and English proficiency level  as indicated on the NYSESLAT, LAB.R and Interim 
Assessments scores. We have a Freestanding program, which includes both in a Stand-Alone and integrated delivery models. 
The program offers the necessary ENL and ELA instructional units required by Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 (CR Part 
154). The Entering, Emerging and Transitioning students are provided with 360 minutes for integrated and in a  Stand-alone 
program and the advanced students, 180 ENL/ELA  per week in an integrated model. Commanding (Tested Out) students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

receive 90 minutes ENL/ELA per week. ENL curriculum is aligned to standard- based instruction and all classrooms follow a 
Balanced Literacy and Balanced Math approach using workshop model methodologies.            
           
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Instructional approaches  and methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the 
demands of the Common Core Learning Standards include SIOP, QTEL, Teachers' College Reading and Writing. Methods such 
as cooperative learning, small group instruction, stations, writing process schema building are also utilized. The integrated ENL 
instruction is provided in English following the Balanced Literacy Approach. ENL techniques and methodologies  are used to 
reach the different learning styles to develop reading, writing, listening and speaking. Home language support is provided 
whenever possible with bilingual dictionaries, libraries, buddy systems and cooperative groupings. The content areas 
are  taught using ENL methodologies and techniques (Total Physical Response, Language Experience Approach, Music, etc.) to 
target all four skills (Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing) and to develop academic English skills in all grades. There is on-
going articulation between the ENL teacher and the classroom teachers and they create lesson plans that include content area 
vocabulary. In addition, there is a weekly common prep for all teachers to collaborate and around the needs of all students 
including ELLs. In their planning, the stages of language acquisition (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding and 
Commanding) are taken into account and multi-level strategies are adapted to reach all levels. We plan based on the language 
proficiency levels of the ELLs as per results of the NYSESLAT. The specific strategies that are implemented for instruction  for 
ELLs are dependent on the number of years that they have been in the New York City Public school system. Furthermore, 
instruction is differentiated based on students' needs or weaknesses. The English language arts standards are the basis for the 
Native Language Arts, English as a New Language and English Language Arts curricula.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

In order to ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year, we have provided and 
administered spelling inventories, running records, comprehension assessments and reading skills. Additionally, we have given 
reading and on-demand writing assessments in Spanish to the Spanish speakers. Furthermore, the results of the LAB-R Spanish 
are utilized to aid the Spanish speaking ELLs. Students are also provided with ample opportunities to access information in 
their home language via library resources, books, software, Internet resources, peers and speakers of their native language in 
school. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
a.  We focus our attention on the ELLs with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE). Once identified, the ENL and classroom 
teachers monitor these students’ academic performance and progress rigorously. SIFE students receive similar instruction 
provided to the other ELLs and additional academic intervention services. In order to enhance these students’ achievement 
and language acquisition, specific strategies such as nonverbal cues, modeling and visuals are emphasized. Differentiated and 
targeted instruction to meet their individual academic needs is delivered in both languages (English and home language) with 
the emphasis on developing literacy in their home language while transitioning into English. We reinforce the importance of 
providing these students with multicultural lessons to validate their cultures and languages. We also provide them with 
reading opportunities in their home language.  Positive reinforcement, continual articulation with teachers and parental 
involvement are factors that support the academic growth of our SIFE ELLs. 
b. Newcomers who have been in the system for less than three years  are provided with intensive small group instruction led 
by both the classroom and ENL teachers. These students are supported with books with home  classroom libraries which cover 
a wide readability level and/or high interest particularly in the non-fiction genre. They receive ELA instruction conducted in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

English using the Readers’/Writers’ Workshop Model with the integration of ENL methodologies which include  Total Physical 
Response (TPR) and the Language Experience Approach (LEA). These methodologies provide the students with experiences for 
which language is generated and used to expand vocabulary and comprehension.  We ensure the coverage of basic sight 
words when instruction focuses on vocabulary building. Other effective strategies include the integration of the arts in the 
teaching of the core curricula and the process of making cultural connections. Additionally, because NCLB now requires ELA 
testing for ELLs after one year, the following are instructional plan for these ELLs: Grade appropriate games and manipulative 
such as picture cards, big books, arts and crafts are effective motivating tools. We also make  frequent use of Read-Aloud and 
Read Along to enhance the ELLs listening comprehension and vocabulary development.  We promote the importance of 
creating a non-threatening environment that lowers the Affective Filter in order to facilitate the rapid acquisition of the English 
language. We address these measures through informal peer counseling meetings, parent/child presentations and sharing 
about cultures in the classrooms and at whole school assemblies. There is  an after school program that assists the newcomers 
with academic support and adjustment. c. Developing ELLs receive ENL instruction based on their proficiency levels . During 
Stand-alone and integrated services, ENL instruction is supported by home language texts and leveled books in the classroom 
libraries, which cover high interest particularly in the non-fiction genre. Students receive ELA instruction conducted in English 
using the Readers’/Writers’ Workshop Model with the integration of ENL methodologies. Modeling of the writing and reading 
skills are incorporated in the direct instruction component of the reading and writing workshops to scaffold the learning of 
new contents and genres. Also, music is used as a prompt or motivation. We implement the Language Experience and hands-
on interdisciplinary approaches, which usually culminates in a project- based format, i.e., a videotape of recorded speeches, 
presentations, and plays. Drama and role-playing are other activities that foster language development skills of our ELLs. 
We praise and acknowledge the multiple modes of learning to enhance or maintain their self-esteem. d. Long term ELLs are 
provided with the appropriate minutes of ENL instruction mandated by their level of proficiency in an integrated model. This 
specific group requires intensive English  and rigorous instruction in the areas of reading and writing. Study skills, use of 
graphic organizers, understanding of test structures and terminologies support the growth of their academic skills. The 
building of their prior knowledge through independent reading and research based activities is prevalent to the development 
of their comprehension skills. Academic vocabulary is also emphasized for this specific subgroup. We encourage the 
integration of technology as a resource to enhance the effectiveness of instruction. We differentiate for these students based 
on areas of need or difficulties.Classrooms are equipped with leveled libraries of informational texts. We make use of small 
group or one-on-one work targeting writing. Additionally, there is an after school program focusing on building reading and 
writing skills. e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status receive 90 minutes of ENL per week using the Teachers' 
College Reading and Writing Workshop model along with ENL methods and strategies in an integrated model. They also 
continue to build academic vocabulary. They remain in their regular monolingual classroom and receive support with their 
ELLs counterparts. The ENL teacher informs their teachers so that they can monitor their academic development. Small group 
instruction is utilized to provide instruction to them.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We provide our ELLs with special needs (SWDs) with appropriate levels of intervention alongwith ENL and home language 
supports based upon IEP recommendations and language proficiency levels in order for them to have access to academic 
content areas and accelerate language development. When integrating in the classroom, the ENL teacher co-teaches with the 
classroom teacher. In addition, to planning lesson together. The students receive ELA instruction using the Readers’/Writers’ 
Workshop with integration of both special needs and ENL methodologies. Ongoing reviews are held to coordinate and 
maintain appropriate services for our ELLs with IEPs.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
At the Ralph Bunche School, the students who were recommended as per IEP to receive ENL instruction 
acquire  a  multidisciplinary and multimodal instruction. This assists in increasing in proficiency levels in speaking, listening, 
reading and writing while giving them the support to meet each of their academic needs. Students are placed in the least 
restrictive environment in order for their learning and social-emotional needs to be addressed. We also provide SETTS, Speech, 
12:1 services and Intensive Intervention (Tier III) services in order to enable diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 
attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted intervention program for ELLs is the "Response to Intervention" (RTI) program for those who are designated at 
risk to prevent a referral to the Committee on Special Education. A referral system of three tiers of intervention is included to 
address the students' literacy and mathematical deficiencies. The needs of Tier I and Tier II are addressed in the classroom. We 
devote a rich instruction to Tier 3 students where activities are reinforced on a daily basis. 
 
ELLs who are at risk are provided with RTI and ENL services daily.  These services focus on literacy and math. They also receive 
ENL services that targets language objectives and second language acquisition. General education and the ENL teachers plan 
rigorous small group instruction for the ELLs focusing on standard-based content knowledge and providing scaffolds to meet 
grade level goals. The targeted interventions for ELA and Math are RTI , and after school programs on a daily basis. Fountas 
and Pinell Guided Reading materials are used by RTI providers to conduct targeted small group instruction based on the results 
of the NYSESLAT and other formative and summative assessments. 
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will implement an after school program for all ELLs who have been in the system for less than three years focusing on 
Spanish literacy. A strong and a positive correlation exist between literacy in the home language of a student and learning EN 
and since most of our newcomers have minimal literacy in their home language (Spanish), it is crucial that they learn the basic 
skills, especially reading and writing in their home language first. Then, they can transfer their knowledge to English..  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs, extra-curricular activities including arts, music and RTI services if they 
have been designated to be at- risk. New arrivals may enroll in an after school program that focuses on home language 
development. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ELL receive ENL services (Grades K-5) 
Balanced literacy in English 
Balance Literacy Classroom libraries 
120 minutes literacy block 
Standards based scope & Sequence for core curriculum in grades K- 5 
Teachers' College Readers' and Writers' Workshop

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The new arrivals ELLs are eligible to participate in the Home Language Arts after school program geared towards 
developing  Spanish literacy.                     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services, resources and support and  correspond to ELLs  ages and grade levels  Each classroom has libraries with 
leveled books and many genres of fiction and informational texts. The teachers use these various means to address each 
student's needs at their current reading level. Spanish libraries are also available for the students to use during specific units of 
study. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

 
     
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
PS 125 shares a building (co-location) with two schools. We borrow and share resources  with each other in order to assist the 
ELLs with their academic, linguistic and socioemotional needs. During assemblies, we invite each of the respective schools' 
students to participate. The ENL at PS 125 and the Columbia Secondary School teachers also collaborate and share lesson plans 
with each other. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In order to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year, we have collaborated with various community 
based organizations to aid the newly enrolled ELLs. PS 125 presents parent orientation sessions and invites parents to visit the 
school and a classroom during the summer. In order to get the students ready for transition at the school's commencement,

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
Throughout the school year, teachers work with the literacy and math coaches. There are staff development sessions and 
collaboration between teachers. The teachers are grouped deliberately and differentiated based on their needs . Every 
professional learning starts with setting goals to establish coherence that are then connected to job-embedded professional 
development. This prepares teachers to use effective strategies in their lesson plans. Teacher groups are differentiated based 
on the following: Curriculum Based Learning, modifications for Reading and Writing Workshop as well as Content Based 
Literacy. The Ralph Bunche School has created a team to respond to the needs of  ELLs population and students with 
disabilities. We also attend TC workshops to learn about the curriculum through differentiation. These workshops are geared 
to scaffold the curriculum in order to meet the ELLs and SWD's needs. 
 
Professional Development schedule: 
October/November (4 sessions) 
January/February (4 sessions)

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parent Engagement time occurs every Tuesday from 2:20 to 3:00 pm. Teachers call parents, arrange  meetings with them. 
Additionally, they prepare progress report cards or letters to be sent home. The ENL teacher informs the ELLs'  parents about 
their language development progress across all content areas. The letters that are written to parents are translated in the 
parents' preferred language. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
In order to foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs, we have a Parent Coordinator. She who is responsible for working 
collaboratively with the school leadership team, staff members, parent association, and community groups to engage and 
involve parents. There are family involvement programs/activities to assist families to participate in order to improve their 
children's academics. We have implemented "Parent Institute Workshops" based on the interests of the parents during the 
academic school year in order to reach underrepresented families due to socio-economic, racial  and/or language barriers. PS 
125 has sponsored family dinners during the academic school year in order to create a stronger sense of community.

At the Ralph Bunche School, engaged scholars and committed teachers come together to create an energetic and joyous 
community for mastering academic and interpersonal skills.  Students create meaning and expand understanding through inquiry-
based teaching.  Each student will develop a personal commitment to learning and artistic expression, a respect for critical and 
creative thinking, an expanding curiosity about the world and its people, make a positive difference in the lives of others, develop 
empathy for those around them and value diversity to become responsible world citizens.  Continuing the legacy of the progressive 
education movement, the Ralph Bunche School is dedicated to helping young people make bold and valuable decisions with their 
lives while acting as a force for positive social change.

OUR PROGRESSIVE APPROACH 
 
In our progressive approach, we believe that education must not be a race for the accumulation of facts, but should be an enriching 
end in itself. We also believe that education is a joint venture among students, parents/caregivers and teachers.   We see the 
individual child’s curiosity, abilities and learning styles as integral factors in designing, individualizing and assessing each student’s 
learning. We believe that the arts are an essential part of the curriculum and that it is important for students to express themselves 
creatively and to use their imaginations freely. We believe that the uniqueness of children is revealed in their very existence and 
that it is the school’s responsibility to foster their innate sense of the mystery and joy of life. 
 
We encourage children to follow their interests, pursue problems in a way that makes sense to them and defend their conclusion 
by explaining their thinking a variety of ways. We understand that there are many kinds of intelligence and the traditional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

academic, cognitive area is one. Other important areas of intelligence are intuition, imagination, artistic creativity, physical 
expression and performance, sensitivity to others, and self-understanding. To neglect any of these areas is to limit students in the 
development of their full human potential. 
 
We engage students with hands-(cid:173)on investigations, projects and design challenges across the grades and subject areas inspiring 
greater interest, depth and understanding. Our approach values the skills involved in formulating one’s own questions, as well as 
answering those of a teacher. We view mistakes and setbacks as important opportunities for both learning and assessment. 
 
We believe each child learns best not by reliance on summative testing or passively consuming knowledge, rather that each child 
learns best by actively constructing their own understanding based on his or her knowledge, skills, and experience. 
 
In the 21st Century, students are faced with the challenge of learning about an interconnected world where knowledge is 
constantly developing. Students in Ralph Bunche School classrooms have their understanding of beliefs, facts, and skills deepened 
and reinforced by applying them to complex real-world situations.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Reginald Higgins, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Ralph Bunche School determines within 30 days of a student's initial enrollment the primary language spoken 
by the parent of each student enrolled, and if such language is not English, whether the parent requires language 
assistance in order to communicate effectively with the department, PS 125 provides translation and 
interpretation services to all parents who need language in order to communicate effectively with the school. We 
utilize Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), ATS reports, and Student Emergency Contact 
cards to assess preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication.

Translation availability services are posted on a bulletin board at the main entrance of the school and outside the 
main office. Our safety plan has procedures that assure that all parents have access to administrative communication 
despite a language barrier. Additionally, Limited English Proficient parents will be made aware of their right to receive 
information via translated signage, brochures, flyers, PTA meetings and international parent’s night. 

 
  

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

 

PS 125 will maintain records of the primary language of each parent in ATS and on the student emergency card. We 
will also provide the parents with surveys to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services. 
We will further use this feedback to improve the quality of our language services by implementing or adapting the 
parents’ input or suggestions.
