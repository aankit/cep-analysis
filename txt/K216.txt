Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school mission statement is: 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Public School 216 is a vibrant learning community where every child is known and supported. We foster strong 
partnerships with parents and community that enhance learning. Through developmentally appropriate learning 
practices, students will become lifelong achievers and stewards of the earth and it’s resources.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

On the path to becoming globally aware citizens and leaders of the 21st century, we provide excellence in academics, a 
forum for positive social and emotional growth with an emphasis on civic and environmental responsibility.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Our School community 

Public School 216 The Arturo Toscanini School is a community school with 750 students from Pre K through 5th grade. 
The school population is comprises 3.2% black, 17.4% Hispanic, 48% White, 28% Asian and 1% American Indian or 
Alaskan Native. The student body consists of 49%boys and 51% Girls with 12.8% Special education students and 24% 
English Language Learners.  

We are proud of our school and all the initiatives that have made P.S. 216 a special place. We pride ourselves in 
balancing a rigorous curriculum, community service and a robust arts program. We celebrate diversity and believe in 
educating the whole child academically, socially, emotionally and physically.  

  We are proud to be a Leader in Me School. The Leader in Me, a program geared toward developing social-

emotional literacy, continues to be implemented here at P.S. 216. It is based on the work of Stephen Covey’s 
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People and puts a focus on making good choices, treating others with respect 
and having personal responsibility for actions, as well as setting and tracking academic and personal goals.  
  We are a Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project school for comprehensive literacy instruction. The 

project develops on-site professional development through the creation of classroom labsites where specific 
teaching strategies are modeled by Teacher's College staff developers and then practiced by classroom 
teachers. Teachers also attend professional learning at Teacher's college to build content knowledge and 
teacher capacity.  

  We are a Go Math and Exemplars School Grades K-5. Students study all facets of math including computation 

and fluency, problem solving and real world applications.  

  We offer an excellent arts education curriculum to our students, which includes visual arts, chorus, 

instrumental music (band), musical theatre and dance company.  

  We house the first Four Season Edible Schoolyard in New York City, an official affiliate of the Edible 

Schoolyard in Berkley, California under the auspices of the well-known chef, Alice Waters. Our Edible 
Schoolyard, is utilized to engaage students in studying origins of food, geography, agriculture and 
conservation through planting crops, harvesting, composting, and other science/social studies related topics 
as developed by our school team. A student run farmstand is open to parents, students and the community. 
Our Culinary Classroom offers students unique opportunities for students to prepare and serve their own 
foods as well as study food storage and preparation from a global perspective. The school garden is a hub for 
our community and offers a wide variety of family activities and community events throughout the school 
year.  

  During the 2017-18 school year, a committee was formed to develop a school-wide PBIS program to further 

develop leadership and reward positive behaviors. Students receive school dollars for acts of kindness, effort, 
outstanding work, or “I was caught doing something good” to improve school-wide behavior. During the 
2017-2018 school year, we have created a volunteer SOARing Committee. The team is looking forward to 
launching a new revamped school store! 

  Our school is now using online program, iReady for ELA and Mathematics (K-5) in order to support 

individualized learning for all students K-5.  

  Parent play a significant role at PS 216. The PTA is active in planning fun and engaging activities for students 

and families both during the school day and afterschool. Parents are welcomed to our school to share in 
celebrations and other parent events.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

  We provide additional hours in school through afterschool programming in collaboration with CBO partners, 

Kings Bay Y and NIA. Both programs offer extracurricular activities and supplemental social and academic 
support. 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Special Student Populations and Their Specific Needs 

Our special student populations include English as a New Language Students and Students with Disabilities as 
indicated in the Overview section.  

  We have an increasing limited English proficient student population and a growing number of former ELL's 

 

working toward mastery of academic language. Our ELL's require intense support in literacy as well as 
scaffolds to help them to acquire grade level content.  
Special Education population included Integrated co-teaching and self-contained classes. The needs of these 
students vary drastically, Over the past several years, our staff has been growing in knowledge and 
methodology to support learners both academically and emotionally.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

PS 216 has made significant progress in developing a supportive environment for all learners. Our Leader in Me 
program has equipped our school with a platform to further develop a culture of leadership across staff and students. 
Our school Lighthouse Team has developed time bound, actionable goals to improve our school culture through 
rigorous academics and distributive leadership. School teams have developed systems to track and analyze data in 
order to effectively plan to meet the needs of our learners.  

During the 2017-18 school year, teacher teams also engaged in professional learning around developing conceptual 
understanding of mathematics. In collaboration with District staff and Generation Ready teacher teams gain new 
insights and develop strategies for using Exemplars to provide regular opportunities for problem solving throughout 
each math unit of study.  

In 2018-19, PS 216 will deepen our work in the Rigorous Instruction element by effectively implementing the 
Teacher's College Units of Study in Reading and Writing in Grades K-5. We will continue to develop the knowledge 
base of balanced literacy through explicit instruction. As a year one project school the creation of classroom labsites

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The NYS item analysis report indicates in 2018, we increased 8% in the number of all students meeting or exceeding 
the Common Core Learning Standards on the State ELA exam, rising from 48% in 2017 to 56% in 2018. The number of 
Students with Disabilities scoring Level 3 and higher on the State ELA exam also increased from 6% in 2017 to 26% in 
2018. The data also indicates that the number of Limited English Proficient students scoring Level 3 and above 
decreased from 15% in 2017 to 8% in 2018.  

The last Quality Review in 2017 indicates that "School leaders and staff develop curricular maps, lesson plans and 
pacing calendars aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and incorporate the instructional shifts. Planning 
documents evidence instructional shifts such as writing from sources, academic vocabulary, and procedural 
knowledge in math" . However, our observational data does not indicate enough growth in meeting the needs of ELL's 
specifically in academic writing. NYSESLAT data indicates that students in Transitioning and Expanding levels of ENL 
instruction typically struggle in writing across content areas.  

In the 2017-18 SY our school engaged in professional learning around developing foundation skills in K-2 as well as 
understanding the components of balanced literacy. We developed an overall plan for a schoolwide approach to the 
literacy block in Reading and writing as well as norm assessment practices. Later in the year, after reflecting our 
school data and classroom observations the decision was made to streamline our approach by applying to become a 
TCRWP Project school. As a project school, we now have a cohesive approach to literacy in classroom K-5. Our units of 
study in reading and writing are now aligned so that one workshop can support another. Advance data reveal that 
although 90 % of our teachers were rated Effective or Highly Effective, growth in the area of Component 1e and 3c are 
still critical to supporting ELL's and Students with disabilities.  

The administrative team is committed to implementing the program with fidelity as this is a priority focus for our 
school.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

Rigorous Instruction: During the 2018-2019 school year, 65% of all students in grades 3-5 including English Language 
Learners (ELLs) and Students with Disabilities (SWD) will achieve grade level standards in Writing as measured by post-
unit on-demand writing assessments using Teacher's College Writing rubric.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
PS 216 is proud of the Leader in Me program we have built over the last four years. In that short time we have 
developed a Lighthouse Team that serves as a steering committee for school improvement in Culture, Academics and 
Leadership. We have developed staff Action Teams that create annual goals and action plans in multiple facets of our 
school community such as data tracking, students leadership roles .Soaring (PBIS) committee and Professional 
learning.  

Last year we implemented student led conferences schoolwide from Kindergarten through Grade 5. Students were 
able to articulate their personal goals throught the use of the leadership notebooks. Ongoing professional learning 
took place to build teacher capacity to develop tools for implementing Leadership notebooks in their classroom  

Over the last three year our English Language Learner population has grown drastically from , 15% in 2015 to 24% in 
2018. State exams results in both ELA and mathematics indicate a decrease in performance for ELL's in 2017-18. As a 
result, PS 216 will focus on developing realistic and rigorous goals for all student. Professional learning will help to 
build teacher capacity in understanding the needs through careful analysis of student formative classroom data and 
studying professional texts.  

Therefore this goal was developed as a next step in year four of our program. We will ensure that we address the 
needs of the whole child by using the Leader in Me program as a springboard to the social-emotional well-being of all 
our students. The impact of this work will yield greater student empowerment and ownership of learning, which will 
put children on the path of college and career readiness. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Supportive Environment – By June 2019, 75% of all students, including English Language Learners and Students with 
Disabilities, will reach self directed academic goals as measured by the Leader in Me monitoring systems maintained 
in Leadership notebooks.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Teacher collaboration in built into daily schedules at PS 216, allowing for at least one common planning period per 
week and additional time for teachers to meet and plan during Monday PD's and Tuesday professional work time. ENL 
teachers are scheduled so that they can collaborate across grade teams. During this time teachers plan curriculum, 
plan assessment, analyze student work in order to develop next steps.  

All of the above data from our School Survey indicated that we are beginning to understand the benefits for our 
students of collaborative planning coupled with inquiry. Although each class has unique needs, units of study ensure 
instructional alignment with standards. In order to increase student achievement, we need to ensure that we 
promote learners’ awareness of the “why” for learning. 

During the 2018-2019 school year, grade teams will build our capacity to use data to inform our small group 
instruction and implement instruction that support all learners based upon current student levels of performance and 
the Common Core Standards. Over three years time our ENL population has grown by 10% moving from 14% to 24%. 
In that population, the bulk of students remain at the "Transitioning" or "Expanding' level of English proficiency. In 
grade 1, that student sub - group makes up 60% of ELL's on the grade and in Grade 2,. the sub-group makes up 74% of 
the ELL's in the grade. In the 2017 school year, our school "Wildly Important Goal" (WIG) tracked student Fountas and 
Pinnell levels across the year, at four benchmarks within the school term. Year end data indicated that our grade 1 
and 2 students stagnated between January and March and struggled to meet grade level proficiency. English 
Language Learners were a major sub-group within that population.  

Therefore this goal was developed to ensure that teachers are tracking students, especially the ones that are on the 
cusp of meeting the standard, and employing promising practices to move these identified students forward. This will 
ensure that teachers are using data in the most effective way to inform instruction. The impact of this work will 
enable us to have more students with a strong foundation in reading and more students going into testing grades on 
or above grade level. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The NYS item analysis report indicates in 2018, increased 5% in the number of all students meeting or exceeding the 
Common Core Learning Standards on the State Mathematics exam, rising from 47% in 2017 to 52% in 2018. The 
number of Students with Disabilities scoring Level 3 and higher on the State Mathematics exam also increased from 
16% in 2017 to 31% in 2018. The data also indicates that the number of Limited English Proficient students scoring 
Level 3 and above decreased from 27% in 2017 to 19% in 2018. 

The 2017- 18 school year the school continued to implement Go Math along with Exemplars to provide ongoing 
practice in problem solving. During professional development Mondays, Teacher teams studied mathematical 
practices and developed shifts in lessons in order to build conceptual knowledge. Generation Ready consultant 
demonstrated highly effective practices in supporting mathematical discourse. Advance data indicated that a shift if 
pedagogy of mathematics was necessary in order to support more students in meeting or exceeding grade level 
standards.  

For the 2018-19 School year, a decision was made to departmentalize Grade 5 to allow upper grade teachers to 
become specialists in either ELA/Social Studies and Math/Science. We are also part of the Algebra for All initiative. 
Common planning time is purposely scheduled so that teachers have time to further develop strategies that best 
support learners. A continuation of professional learning is planned and will include Math Talks later in the school 
year.  

Therefore our goal was developed to continue to improve teacher effectiveness by developing a common 
understanding of instructional excellence and promising practices in mathematics. The impact of this goal is greater 
fluency in math and greater proficiency in the math shifts/practices. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our school attendance rate in the 2017-18 school year was 94%. Absenteeism spiked before holidays and on half -
days, hovering between 85-90% Our attendance team found that chronically absent children increased in the 2017-18 
school year. Students who are chronically absent miss critical instructional time and struggle both academically and 
socially. According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, our rating was 94% positive in creating strong community 
ties. We would like to capitalize on this aspect of our school to build awareness for families and provide targeted 
outreach and support. Our school team(s) plans to streamline our systems for documenting, analyzing and following 
up on attendance related issues. Our action plan is multi-tiered beginning with school administration , attendance 
team members , teacher and then to support staff. Thus, creating a greater emphasis on the importance of regular 
attendance and good punctuality.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
Strong Family and Community Ties – By June 2019, 70% of targeted students will reach individual attendance goals 
resulting in proficiency in Social Studies as measured by class assessments and reflected in report card grades.

kindergarten, the teachers utilize the best resources so that our youngest community members are prepared 
for kindergarten and beyond. 

  This year our pre-kindergarten teachers will continue to assess all of our pre-kindergarten students 

individually, three times a year (fall, winter, spring) using The Work Sampling System. This tool enables 
teachers to collect information on the child’s work and compare it to grade-specific guidelines. The data will 
identify what children are learning, what they are beginning to master, and what they still need to work on. It 
also informs instructional planning. The assessment addresses the following areas: Personal & Social 
Development, Language and Literacy, Scientific Thinking, Social Studies, The Arts, Physical Development, 
Health and Safety. The Work Sampling System will also be utilized to ensure our pre-kindergarten students 
are fully prepared to meet the demands of the kindergarten program and beyond.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. [P.S. 216], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Teacher Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the 
school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[P.S. 216] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. The school will maintain this information. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. 

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30th of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Rationale: 
PS 216 provides a supplemental Title III after school program to help support the needs of our 
English language learners.  The rationale of the ESL after school Program is to provide instruction 
through supplemental, but direct instructional services for students to help accelerate student learning 
and literacy development.  This additional time will support their acquisitions in all areas of English 
language development, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  Students will receive 
instruction through interdisciplinary lessons that are aligned with the Common Core Learning 
Standards. They will experience the English language in all four modalities.  We expect to accelerate 
student learning and enhance the students’ acquisition of the English language.  This program also 
supports the teaching of foundational and literacy skills and strategies in a small group setting or on a 
one-to-one basis, depending on students’ needs and goals.   
 
Subgroups and Grade Levels to be Served:  
This program is available to all English language learners from grades K-5.  As of now, the total 
number of ELL's to be invited into the program is 176.  However, the number of students to be 
serviced in the Title III after school program may change as more students are enrolled into our 
school or if some ELL students do not take part in the Title III Supplemental Program.  Students are 
grouped by grade band and by their ENL levels and needs, whether entering, emerging, transitioning, 
expanding, and commanding.  These levels are determined by the NYSESLAT 2018 and Fall 
2018 NYSITELL scores.   Information and data is also gathered through the EDAT (ELL Data 
Analysis Tool).  This tool gives us valuable information as to student progress and 
proficiency.  Students who did not meet AMAO 1, or did meet AMAO 1 but are flagged as at-risk 
students, will be the targeted, spotlight students through differentiated instruction and scaffolded 
support as direct instruction is provided.  This data is used as a guide to plan for the Title III 
Supplemental Program.  In addition, the Title III Supplemental program is intended to target 
subgroups such as, newcomers, beginners, and SIFE students.  Newcomers will be engaged in 
differentiated activities to increase phonemic awareness and oracy throughout the program.  Teachers 
will identify and assess SIFE students accordingly to determine where they are academically and then 
use this data to inform instruction in an effort to close an achievement gaps.  The Title III 
Supplemental Program may also be opened to students who are former English language learners 
(FELLs), those who scored commanding on the NYSESLAT within the last two years. After 
reviewing our school's data, we recognize that 46 %of 
our ELL population are Expanding and many have remained Expanding for two consecutive years.  In 
response to this data, we are going to specifically target our Expanding ELL population 
and invite them to the After School Program first.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The program for ELLs in grades K-5 will take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays, each session 
being two hours, each from 2:25-4:25pm.  ELLs in grades 1 -5 will begin on November 28th , 2018 
and end on March 14th, 2019.  There will be 30 sessions for this group. ELL Kindergarten students 
begin on March 20th, 2019 and ending on April 11th, 2019.  There will be 8 sessions for this group. 
 
Language of Instruction:  
The language of instruction will be English. However, home language support will be provided by 
bilingual dictionaries, bilingual texts, and bilingual APPS to provide translation support, as students 
have access to iPads.  In addition, students are purposefully paired with native language partners of 
varying proficiency levels.   
 
Number and Types of Certified Teachers: 
There are currently two ESL certified teachers on staff at P.S. 216, who provide ESL instruction 
during school hours.  The Title III after school program will be instructed by Mrs. Rosanna 
LaFroscia, a licensed ESL teacher with TESOL certification K-12 and Childhood Education 
Certification 1-6.  Mrs. LaFroscia will infuse a repertoire of ESL strategies into instruction as a means 
to foster student learning and English language acquisition for students.  The other teacher instructing 
the Title III after school program is Mrs. KellyAnn Kotropoulos, a licensed special education 
teacher.  The third teacher is a licensed classroom teacher with an Early Childhood License (Birth-
Grade 2).  Three teachers for 30 sessions, two hours each sessions, equals 180 hours, at cost to 
Title III $9,000.  Since this is a two-hour program, the ELL licensed teacher will work for 40 minutes 
of each session with each of the three groups and then switch groups consistently throughout the 
duration of the program.  This ensures that every student is being serviced by the licensed ELL 
teacher. Student attendance will be recorded and maintained on a roster as students are enrolled into 
the program.  Parents will be notified of the Title III Program through a letter sent home in their 
preferred language.  Our parent coordinator will utilize the Language and Translation Unit to translate 
the notice in the necessary languages.  A supervisor is present at all times when students are in the 
building to ensure their safety and well-being.  A supervisor will be paid out of Title III for 45 hours, 
at cost to Title III, coming to a total of approximately $2,700 with fringe.  Additionally, we plan to 
hire 2 paraprofessionals for the After School Program to support students in their learning during the 
sessions.  If we hire 2 paras at 60 hours each, the total is approximately $4,440, at cost to Title III. 
 
Types of Materials: 
Materials will be purchased at cost to Title III and specifically for the Title III after school program, 
at cost to Title III.  We will be purchasing the updated version of 
NYSESLAT Test Prep Books.  "Finish Line for ELLs" is a 
consumable student book that provides English proficiency practice in preparation for the 
NYSESLAT.  180  of these student books will be ordered to ensure that each student has their own 
copy, as well as five annotated Teacher's Editions.  These books were selected because they aim to 
provide students with friendly, effective exercises that are designed to 
help improve language proficiency across all four modalities.  
We will also be ordering a textbook titled "Literacy Instruction for English Language Learners" by 
Nancy Cloud, Fred Genesee, and Else Hamdyan, for our teacher study group, which we plan to use 
for our study group professional development sessions.  This will be facilitated by our ENL teacher, 
Mrs. LaFroscia .  This will also be at cost to Title III.  This textbook was selected to support teachers 
and staff in teaching in multicultural contexts across the grade levels with relevance to 
our first year implementation of the Teacher's College Reading  and Writing Curriculum.  Some of 
the topics covered in this text include policy and programs, inquiry-based learning, program models, 
language acquisition, instructional approaches to teaching a second language, the role of culture in 
education, language in the content areas, assessment, and pathways to partnerships within our school 
community. Hosting a focused study group on ELL-related topics will support our staff to

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
accommodate our growing population of English language learners.  As per the CR Part 154, teachers 
are required to have 15% of their professional development to be ELL-related and 50% for ENL 
teachers.  Six books at $37.50 totals $225, at cost to Title III. 
We will also be using iReady, which  is a personalized  program for each student, designed to 
support our students in reading.  It integrates assesment and online instruction, individualized for 
each learner.  We are looking forward to integrating this into our after school program to 
support our Expanding ELLs with targeted, individualized, 
assessment informed instruction.  This will not be at cost to Title III. 
In addition, we will also be ordering 10  "Scaffolding Comprehension Toolkits for English 
Language Learners" by Stephanie Harvey, Anne Goudvis, Brad Buhrow, Anne Upczak 
Garcia.  This Toolkit was designed to provide previews and 
supports for content comprehension.  Since increasing our students' reading proficiency, accuracy, 
fluency, comprehension, and expression is our schoolwide goal for our students, 
and our ELL population is on the rise, we see this toolkit serving as a resource for our educators, to 
support  them with a variety of reading comprehension strategies.  We will order 6 primary kits and 5 
secondary kits at $42 per kit, totaling $420, at cost to Title III.

Begin description here:            
 Rationale:  
In P.S. 216, professional development is offered to teachers via grade conferences, faculty 
meetings, data and inquiry, and district meetings as well as designated staff development days 
throughout the school year including Election Day.  In addition, professional development is 
offered to staff every Monday from 2:20- 3:40pm on various topics.  These professional 
development activities are often administered by our administration as well as the 
teachers.  Support is also provided by  ELL support personnel from the Division of English 
Language Learners and Student Support (DELLSS) and Brooklyn South through meetings and 
workshops on various topics. In addition, staff members are respectively assigned to professional 
development days Teacher's College Reading and Writing, and GoMath, the literacy and math 
programs in our school.  Teachers and staff who attend these meetings gather content-specific 
information, collaborate with teachers from other schools, and develop their craft, only to turn-
key this information to our P.S. 216 staff.  During professional development sessions provided 
by teachers and administration, information is turn-keyed and given to other teachers and 
staff.  These professional development sessions provide the opportunity for teachers to 
collaborate in an effort to progress units of study in literacy and math, analyze trends and data, 
and ensure alignment with the Common Core State Standards.   Particularly, professional 
development is geared toward and focuses on a variety of strategies and implementations for all 
students including Students with Disabilities and ELLs.  This includes implicit and explicit 
instruction, conferencing techniques, differentiation and scaffolding techniques, UDL strategies, 
small group instruction, and guided reading.  The use of hard and soft data is used to guide the 
instruction of all ELLs, including ELLs with special needs. For all teachers, 15% of their

Part C: Professional Development  
Professional Learning Sessions will be ELL-Related and for ELL Teachers, 50% of their 
Professional Learning Sessions will be ELL-Related, as to comply with the mandates of the CR-
Part 154.  ELL teachers will be hosting Professional Learning Sessions, turn-keying new ELL-
Related concepts, strategies, and data.  ELL Teachers will receive Professional Development 
Sessions hosted by Brooklyn South BFSC.  All agendas and attendance sheets will be maintained 
in a PD Binder. 
 
As stated above, we will also be ordering our teacher textbook titled "Literacy Instruction for 
ELLs" for our teacher study group, which we plan to use for our study group professional 
development sessions.  This will be facilitated by our ENL teacher, Mrs. LaFroscia.  This will 
also be at cost to Title III.  This textbook was selected to support teachers and staff in teaching in 
multicultural contexts across the grade levels.  Some of the topics covered in this text include 
policy and programs, inquiry-based learning, program models, language acquisition, 
instructional approaches to teaching a second language, the role of culture in education, language 
in the content areas, assessment, and pathways to partnerships within our school community. 
Hosting a focused study group on ELL-related topics will support our staff in accommodating 
our growing population of English language learners.  We are planning to do 4-6 week cycles for 
each study group.  As per the CR Part 154, teachers are required to have a minimum of 15% of 
their professional development and ENL teachers are required to have a minimum of 50% of 
their professional development to be ELL-related and dedicated to language acquisition in 
alignment best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content 
instruction for ELLs. 
 
As stated above, there are weekly professional development sessions offered to staff on Mondays 
from 2:20-3:40pm.  These sessions are purposefully planned and implemented to provide 
teachers of both ELLs and non-ELLs with more information and additional supports as needed, 
on an ongoing basis.  The topics of these professional development sessions include Teacher 
Advance, SmartBoard Training, GoogleDocs training, STARS training, analyzing citywide and 
instructional expectations, MOSL, etc.  All professional development activities and sessions are 
provided in an effort to expand teacher resources for student data, as well as to expand the 
teachers' repertoire of strategies, including implementing technology, to teach both ELL students 
and non-ELL students.  Records, including agendas and attendance sheets, will be maintained in 
a Professional Development Binder, which will be stored in the Principal's office for easy 
accessibility and availability.  Teachers and staff are also trained on the Common Core State 
Standards and the citywide instructional expectations to effectively plan instruction.  Teachers 
and staff analyze the teacher Advance to increase awareness of expectations to overall improve 
teacher effectiveness.  These professional development sessions have been provided by: 
*Mrs. Donna Neglia, Principal 
*Mrs. Andrea Ceretti, Assistant Principal 
*Marianne DiLauro, Data Specialist 
*Rosanna LaFroscia, ENL Teacher 
Additional providers will be added to this list as professional development sessions are planned 
and implemented throughout the school year.

the year that the ENL teachers and other staff will attend.  Title III will be updated as necessary 
when those dates and workshops are set. 
 
Additionally, we will contract an ELL professional development coach, 
Linda DeLuma from CITE.  We have used Linda as a 
resource to support teachers  and students in our ELL dominant classes, on site in 
their classrooms, to provide strategies and support for our English language learners.  This will 
be at cost to Title III.

  how parents will be notified of these activities 

Begin description here:            
  
Rationale:  
Parent engagement activities are targeted for parents of ELLs in an effort to impact the higher 
achievement of ELLs and provide parents with the information they need to ensure the success 
of their children.  Aside from the mandated parent orientations that are offered on an ongoing 
basis throughout the year for parents whose children are newly admitted and identified as ELLs, 
parents will continue to be invited to parent workshops and parent engagement sessions 
throughout the year. (see below)    
As per the CR Part 154, schools must meet with parents/guardians of ELLs at least once a year, 
in addition to the mandated meetings, to discuss the goals of the program, their child's language 
development progress and needs, and their child's language proficiency assessment results. These 
meetings will be taking place throughout the year on an ongoing basis during Tuesday's allotted 
parent engagement time. 
 
How Parents Will be Notified of these Meetings/Information:  
Parents are notified of meetings in both their native language and in English via notices sent 
home, in the parents' preferred languages, with students, direct contact at dismissal, and/or phone 
calls. Records will be maintained including agendas, attendance sheets, and invitations.  In 
addition, there are weekly sessions devoted to Parent Engagement on Tuesdays from 2:20-
3:00pm. During these weekly sessions, teachers and staff are expected to contact parents, 
complete progress forms, set up meetings with parents, and any other activity that would foster 
parent involvement as necessary.  
 
In addition to the above parent engagement activities, PS 216 report cards for ELLs are in their 
native and English to ensure understanding and accessibility for parents to measure their child’s 
progress, strengths and weaknesses.  In addition, parents receive the NYCDOE “Suggested 
Questions for Families to Ask During Parent Teacher Conferences,” which comes in multiple 
languages and is distributed accordingly.  Other important notices/documents such as the 
program placement, program selection, program information, etc. are distributed in both the 
native language of the parent and in English. 
 
We have several bilingual paraprofessionals in our school , including those who speak Spanish, 
Russian, and Arabic, who are able to provide translations when necessary.  These translators  aid 
us as we work to keep parents informed of their rights, choices, and accountability.  Parents are 
also supported and encouraged to Log into ARIS to access their child’s data.  In addition, our 
school does reach out to the NYC Translation and Interpretation for support on an as-need 
basis.  There are also signs in the building regarding translation available, should there be a 
need.

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Paste response to questions here: 
  
Across all grades, kindergarten through fifth grade, early literacy skills are assessed using formative assessments and 
curriculum-embedded assessments.  Here at P.S. 216, we use Fountas and Pinnell Running Record levels, Fundations phonics 
assessments (grades k-3), Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Curriculum and assessments, pre-and post-assessments, and 
the NYC ELA and Math Performance Tasks, as they are provided.  We are currently implementing iReady, which  is a 
personalized  program for each student, designed to support our students in reading.  It integrates assesment 
and online instruction, individualized for each learner.  We are looking forward to integrating this into our program to 
support our students with targeted, individualized, assessment informed reading instruction.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

Our data reveals that English language learners need individualized instruction based on their English language proficiency 
level, as well as their individual strengths and weaknesses to meet and achieve the Common Core State Standards in ELA and 
across the core content areas.  Our goal is to provide multiple pathways and entry points for English language learners to have 
access to the curriculum, meet and achieve state standards to ultimately become college and career ready. 
The data from our ongoing, formative assessments informs teacher instructional plans as we plan units and curriculum. It 
helps us to create data-based instructional expectations in ELA and across core content areas for students based on individual 
strengths and weaknesses to accelerate student learning across the grades.  Using data, teachers plan individualized 
instruction and differentiated lessons to help each child progress to a higher level of achievement and educational growth.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To support this effort, we have several structures in place. We have a schoolwide assessment calendar with all of our 
assessments, benchmarks, and checkpoints listed so that we can vertically assess our students consistently throughout the 
grades.  
 
For Fountas & Pinnell Running Record assessments, we take a reading inventory and initial assessment in September-
October  as our first checkpoint, followed by checkpoint 2 in December-January, checkpoint 3 in March-April, & checkpoint 4 in 
May-June.  In addition, Fountas & Pinnell Running records are to be given on an ongoing basis as classroom teachers deem 
necessary. F&P Kits are readily available for every grade so that materials and resources are accessible.  The end of the year 
F&P assessments are administered by a teacher of the next grade. Fountas and Pinnell Assessments are tied to our MOSL. 
Professional Development Training is offered to teachers for Fundations, our core phonics program throughout our 
school.  Teachers utilize assessments and ongoing Quick Checks on a regular basis to inform instruction and pacing of their 
units. 
Grade Inquiry Teams meet during PD time on Mondays, other professional work time on Tuesdays, and during common 
preparation and planning periods.  During these Inquiry Team Meetings, teachers norm and evaluate student work from an 
objective point of view, noting trends in strengths and weaknesses both within their class and across their grades.  Some 
samples of work products evaluated during these meetings are Teacher's College Writing Pre and Post Assessments and Pre-
Post GoMath Unit Assessments. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Paste response to question here: 
 Many summative assessments and baseline/benchmark assessments are being used to identify baseline progress and areas of 
need.  PS 216 uses NYC ELA and Math Performance Tasks to identify baseline data for our students, as well as to monitor 
progress and highlight areas that need focus.  Grade Team Inquiry Meetings meet using Inquiry Team Protocol to evaluate 
student performance and are trained to note objective data and noticings and to identify patterns and trends within their 
classes as well as across the grade.  This data is then used to inform instruction and guide teachers as they navigate through 
their units of study, pointing teachers to focus areas of need and to guide overall instruction and small group instruction in ELA 
and math. 
ELA and Math State Exam Scores, as well as NYSESLAT scores are evaluated and taken into account to determine student’s 
language proficiency and to identify those students far below meeting standards, approaching standards, meeting standards, 
and exceeding standards.  This impacts student’s class placement, interventional supports, supplemental supports, grouping 
within classrooms, and ENL Programming. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have several structures in place to support and address interventions once the summative data has been gathered.  The 
data from the summative, baseline assessments and formative, embedded assessments are used to guide overall grouping of 
students in classes, ELL Programming, and RtI/AIS students.  
The EDAT tool provides us with a data snapshot of all of our English language learners and is used to drive both instructional 
and school-wide decisions for our students.  It provides data as to the annual increases in the percentage of English language 
learners making progress and the annual increases in the percentage of English language learners attaining English language 
proficiency.  The EDAT also provides data as to the adequate yearly progress (AYP) for English language learner subgroups in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

meeting grade-level academic achievement standards in ELA and mathematics.  This resource of data helps teachers make 
informative decisions to target specific subgroups of our English language learner population that is based on the data.  In 
addition, the EDAT tool also allows us to filter data to create targeted groups per grade level.  The Advanced Early Warning 
Indicator will continue to be used to identify students needing Response to Intervention and/or Academic Intervention 
Services. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:  
For each English language learner who scores below specified levels of performance on the NYSESLAT, we determine the 
additional support services that will be put into place to provide for those student(s).  Patterns from data are used to 
determine if a student needs RtI.  Tier 1 receives core instruction, Tier 2 receives a “double dose” of small group, targeted 
instruction, and Tier 3 receives one to one intervention administered by AIS teachers, ENL teachers, Reading teachers, and 
classroom teachers. 
Some of the evidence that is taken into consideration for students’ eligibility for RtI or AIS are as follows: 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
Data drives and informs our ELL Programs at P.S. 216.  
The EDAT tool provides us with a data snapshot of all of our English language learners and is used to drive both instructional 
and school-wide decisions for our students.  It provides data as to the annual increases in the percentage of English language 
learners making progress and the annual increases in the percentage of English language learners attaining English language 
proficiency.  The EDAT also provides data as to the adequate yearly progress (AYP) for English language learner subgroups in 
meeting grade-level academic achievement standards in ELA and mathematics.  This resource of data helps teachers make 
informative decisions to target specific subgroups of our English language learner population that is based on the data.  In 
addition, the EDAT tool also allows us to filter data to create targeted groups per grade level.  The Advanced Early Warning 
Indicator will continue to be used to identify students needing Response to Intervention and/or Academic Intervention 
Services.  The EDAT demonstrates student performance in comparison to non-ELLs and Former ELLs.  A Professional 
Development session is devoted to disseminating the EDAT to classroom and out of classroom teachers to give everyone 
access to this data.  Teachers and staff are then encouraged to engage in a “Make and Take” where they organize their 
students based on the EDAT indicators and decide as a grade team how they will use that data to inform their instruction. 
 
NYSESLAT results are also used to evaluate and inform our ELL Programs.  The RLAT report from ATS provides us with the 
English language proficiency levels of our students across the four modalities: reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  The 
breakdown by modality provides great insight as to the strengths and weaknesses in modality across the grades, which 
impacts our teacher pedagogy.  Additionally, the overall scores determine the students’ language proficiency level, which is 
ultimately used to inform our ELL programming as we program to service our students by providing the adequate amount of 
minutes of instructional time with an ENL teacher, as per the CR-Part 154.  Our Principal and Assistant Principal develops the 
ENL Program along with the ENL Coordinator and ENL Teachers as we evaluate the data from the RLAT and monitor 
compliance accordingly.  Based on the proficiency level and the amount of minutes of ENL service to be provided by and ENL 
teacher, we develop an ENL program with a combination of stand-alone and integrated ENL instructional time.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

One of the structures we have in place to disseminate findings in order to make adjustments to our programs is through 
Professional Development provided from ENL Teachers to staff.  As per the CR-Part 154, each school must provide professional 
development to all teachers and administrators that specifically address the needs of English language learners.   A minimum 
of 15% of all professional development must be dedicated to language acquisition, including ELL Strategies and best practices 
for English language learners.   For all ENL Teachers, 50% of all  professional development must be dedicated to language 
acquisition, including  ELL Strategies and best practices for English language learners.  ENL teachers and any teacher or staff 
member who had ENL Training is invited to turnkey or have an ELL component on given professional development 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

sessions.  This practice, as well as evaluating data such as that of the RLAT, helps to inform programming and any adjustments 
that need to be made accordingly.

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Paste response to questions here:  
Students are provided services as per their ENL instructional level.  Entering and Emerging level students receive 360 minutes 
of ENL instruction per week, 8 periods of services.  Those students at the Transitioning and Expanding level receive 180 
minutes of ENL instruction per week, 4 periods of services.  In addition, students at the Commanding level receive 90 minutes 
of ENL, 2 periods of services, or programmed for an Alternate Pathways Options.  These are all in compliance with the CR Part 
154.2 mandates.  
a.)  More specifically, students at the Entering level of proficiency receive a total of 360 minutes of ENL.  A minimum of 180 of 
those minutes is stand-alone ENL and a minimum of 180 of those minutes is integrated ENL during an ELA block.  Students at 
the Emerging level of proficiency receive a total of 360 minutes of ENL.   A minimum of 90 minutes is standalone ENL and a 
minimum of 180 minutes is integrated ENL during an ELA block.  There is flexibility with the remaining 90 minutes for students 
at this level, where these 90 minutes may be in standalone or integrated ENL during ELA or any other content area.  Students 
at the Transitioning level of proficiency receive a total of 180 minutes of ENL.  A minimum of 90 minute is integrated ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

during an ELA block.  There is flexibility with the remaining 90 minutes for students at this level, where these 90 minutes may 
be in standalone or integrated ENL during ELA or any other content area.  Students at the Expanding level of proficiency 
receive a total of 180 minutes of ENL.  A total of all 180 minutes is integrated ENL only during an ELA block or any other 
content area.  Students at the Commanding level of proficiency receive a total of 90 minutes of ENL.  A total of all 90 minutes is 
integrated ENL only during an ELA block or any other content area.  All program scheduling is usually developed by the 
assistant principal in collaboration with the ELL Coordinator and the ENL teachers. 
 
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Paste response here:  
 ENL teachers provide content area instruction that is closely aligned with the Common Core State Standards.  Teachers use 
formal and informal data to inform instruction.  We group students for instruction based on proficiency level and provide 
multiple entry points and scaffolds for students as necessary to get them to accelerate and achieve the rigorous Common Core 
State Standards.   Some strategies that we implement as ENL teachers of the Common Core include DOK questioning and 
research-based RtI strategies, as per the DOE website.  Students are provided differentiated instruction, scaffolds and support 
with graphic organizers, webs, maps, charts, etc. to help them organize and produce their thoughts.  Vocabulary development 
is enriched by using Frayer maps, tiered synonym language ladders, and analyzing grammar/syntax which is embedded in 
content instruction.  ENL and classroom teachers are trained in Fundations.  Teachers utilize this training in the classroom and 
with small groups in order to provide a double dose of instruction in phonics, spelling, handwriting, visual and oral blending, 
reading, etc.  ENL teachers are also included in 
the iReady and Teacher's College Reading and Writing Curriculum Staff Development sessions and trainings.  All of these 
teaching practices are implemented on an ongoing basis through explicit content instruction and aim to foster the language 
development of all students while achieving the Common Core. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Paste response to question here:  
 English language learners are appropriately evaluated in their native language.  Spanish speaking ELLs are tested using the 
Spanish LAB following administration of the English NYSITELL.  In addition, students in grades 3-5 are able to take the 
Mathematics State Test in their native language as per specific accommodations, using the Bilingual Dictionaries as a 
resource.  Furthermore, as part of the ELL intake process, students who are new admits are informally interviewed in their 
native language through translators to determine their language dominance.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Paste response to questions here:  
 
All ELL subgroups are supported with differentiated instruction. 
a.)SIFE students will receive additional services according to Response to Intervention protocol.  Teachers implement research-
based strategies through various groupings.  After school programs are also available, as well as AIS for reading and 
mathematics. 
b.)Newcomers, who have been in the school for less than three years receive phonics, vocabulary, reading and writing 
instruction in all content areas and across genres, to provide comprehensible and rigorous academic education, with an 
emphasis on promoting achievement of the Common Core standards and expectations.  An implicit focus on grammar and 
writing mechanics are embedded in lessons in order to support ELA test taking practice for students in testing 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

grades.  Newcomers also receive small group instruction, re-teaching, and scaffolding as we move through units of study to 
ensure they are receiving comprehensible input throughout the year. 
c.)Developing ELLs are supported with a combination of integrated and stand-alone ENL, as mandated by their level.  Teachers 
aim to provide comprehensible input and rigorous academic education in ELA and in all other content areas. 
d.)Long term ELLs, those receiving service for 4-6 years, are targeted for RtI, using research-based instruction to support them 
in areas of needs and taking the necessary steps to progress each student.   Students with special needs will receive academic 
support from the AIS and SETTS teachers with instruction focused on meeting the individual educational needs and IEP areas 
of weakness. 
e.)Former ELLs are strategically in the same class as current ELLs to ensure that the ENL Integrated model is accommodating to 
both ELLs and FELLs.  When the ESL teacher pushes in, she used ESL strategies to support those students who tested 
proficient.  Therefore, they will be getting the scaffolding they need to further accelerate in content areas.  As per the new 
mandates in the CR-Part 154, students who are at the Proficient/Commanding level of language proficiency will continue to 
receive 90 minutes of ENL services in an integrated setting in ELA or other content areas. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Paste response to question here:  
As stated above, students with special needs will receive academic support from the AIS and SETTS teachers with instruction 
focused on meeting the individual educational needs and IEP areas of weakness.  In addition, teachers of ELL students with 
disabilities align all content with the Common Core State Standards.  Using various scaffolding methods, all students are given 
the same high expectations, coupled with quality, challenging lessons, to extend students’ thinking and achievement beyond 
their comfort level.  Therefore, pushing all students to accelerated learning.  Some strategies are taught through shared 
reading and writing experiences, modeled writing, guided reading and writing, and access to technology through laptops 
and/or iPads.  Teachers promote appropriate grade level contextual support through purposefully chosen texts and strategies 
accordingly.  A focus on higher level questions through using the DOK wheel as a resource provides student accountability to 
accelerate content area comprehension and English language development. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Paste response to question here:  
 ELL teachers are using an integrated, co-teaching approach with teachers of grades K-5.  Teachers collaborate on lesson 
planning and appropriate scaffolding and small groups that fit the needs of their group.  Curriculum is fully aligned with the 
Common Core State Standards and the citywide expectations.  All collaborative teaching practices and decisions are purposeful 
and data informed to ensure the progress and literacy of all students.  Taken into consideration are the IEP goals and progress 
of those students with disabilities.  This flexibility and diversity within classrooms enables diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their 
IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Paste response to question here: 
There are intervention services offered at P.S. 216 for all students as well as for ELL’s.  This intervention is available for ELLs at 
all levels of proficiency.  Grades 3 through 5 are provided standardized ELA, Science, and Mathematics test 
preparation.  Students throughout all the grade levels are offered test preparation for the NYSESLAT.  Other intervention 
services include funded reading support, speech and language, SETTS, AIS in reading and/or math, and supplemental after 
school programs.  These after school programs are offered throughout the year including a Supplemental Title III after school 
program, an enrichment after school program, a state test preparation after school program, and Saturday 
Academy.  Throughout our school, teachers are utilizing the RtI protocol to move students in and out of the spotlight, focus 
group on an ongoing and flexible basis.The ELL groups targeted include newcomers and entering students, as well as students 
at the emerging, transitioning, and expanding levels who are at the cusp of progressing to the next proficiency level.

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Paste response to question here:   
   
Based on the data and trends, the programs that are to continue with us for the upcoming school year are as 
follows.  Beginning in the 2018-2019 school year, all Grades K-5 will be implementing Teacher's College Reading and Writing, as 
well as iReady.  GoMath is the mathematics program that is implemented school-wide.  These programs were approved by the 
City of New York as programs that are fully aligned with the Common Core State Standards and are to prepare students to be 
College and Career Ready. In addition, RazzKids is a leveled reading assessment tool and program that will help to assess 
students individually, informing teachers of their students’ strengths and weakness, as well as informing them of the groups 
and subgroups that exist in their classrooms based upon ELA reading skill sets and needs.  This will be used in grades K-5.  It is 
especially useful for ELL teachers, as you can create report groups that will inform those teachers of their specific student 
group data.  PS 216 will also continue to have the Edible Schoolyard gardening and kitchen classes.  This offers hands-on 
experiences for students in non-fiction and informational context.  This helps to support the ELLs with scientific vocabulary and 
processes as they work and learn in heterogeneous and cooperative learning groups.  Additionally,, the Robinhood Library will 
continue to be part of our school-wide resource.  It’s a print-rich library with texts in both English and sections of native 
language texts as well.  It’s equipped with SmartBoard technology and available laptops and desktops for students to navigate 
through the library’s database and search for books.  This technology is also available for students to utilize the internet when 
researching.  The librarian also infuses lessons from The Leader in Me program, which we have been implementing for 4 
years.  In addition, , every classroom is now equipped with Smartboard and Elmo technology, as well as individual iPads and 
laptops which are available for students in each class.  
One of the current trends that our data has identified as an area of need and focus for our school is Mathematical Problem 
Solving.  We have since adopted Exemplars as a supportive resource for K-5 students to provide increased exposure, practice, 
and teaching of the problem solving procedure and mathematical thinking.  We're working on increasing academic language 
specifically using Math Tasks as a way to spark more student discussion within the content area.  Exemplars also supports 
using mathematical academic language to communicate problem solving thinking.  We will continue to implement Exemplars 
initiative to support our data findings.  In addition to that our NYSESLAT results indicate weaknesses in reading and writing, 
where speaking and listening are displayed as strengths for our students.  In response to this trend, our school has adopted the 
Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Curriculum, in addition to the school-wide literacy programs such as iReady, to support 
students in developing their literacy skills.

Does not apply. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Paste response to question here:  
ELLs are included as an asset in all school-wide programs.  We designed the the ENL stand-alone schedule to 
ensure that our ELLs attend preps with their classes, specifically Gym and/or Dance.  For example, if ELLs are pulled 
out for Stand-Alone ENL during library, they are invited to Open Access periods in the library, which takes place once a 
week.  This way they still have access to our Robinhood library, can do their research, and check out books.  ELL students are 
also offered and invited to attend our Title III Supplemental After School Program that takes place approximately from 
November through April of the school year and our Saturday Academy which usually takes place in 
the Spring.  These programs  are designed to is support ELL students who are at various levels of proficiency, accordingly.  We 
also offer and invite ELLs who tested proficient within two years, our Former ELLs.  A variety of other After-school programs 
are offered throughout the year including an enrichment after school program, and a state test preparation after school 
program.  Students are provided equal access to all school programs as they become available and based on what is 
appropriate for each individual student.  Students are also included in our Disney in Schools Musical Theater After-School 
Program.  We received this grant in the 2016-2017 school year and will continue to have a residency 
program throughout this year.  This program’s auditions and on-set positions are open and available to all students in our 
school, including ELLs.  In addition, we ensure that Garden/Kitchen classes and Puppetry in 
Practice sessions are not scheduled during ENL periods, to ensure that ELLs are in attendance.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Paste response to question here: 
 At PS 216, there are many classroom technological modes of instruction and instructional materials available to support ELLs 
in content areas and across curriculum.    The use of SmartBoards, Elmos, laptops, iPads, and internet access provide students 
with the opportunity to use technology as a resource and provides teachers with multimedia components to their lesson plans 
and extension activities.  Applications and subscriptions to RazzKids is utilized in our 
school.  RazzKids and iReady are interactive reading programs for our students to practice reading fluency and 
comprehension.  Each student has an individual Login and a password to get into their personal reading account.   Teachers 
and students are able to monitor student access and student progress.  It is easily interactive, as students can change their 
reading level accordingly, answer questions after each read, and even have the book read aloud to them.  These levels are all 
individually based on each child’s reading level and are adjusted to reflect their progress.  The students can listen to a story, 
read a story aloud, record themselves reading, and then take a comprehension quiz.  In addition, applications are used to 
translate and/or serve as a bilingual picture dictionary to increase vocabulary comprehension with the support of their native 
language.   Content area program materials are also available for GoMath, as well as for our science and social studies 
programs.  Amplified Science and Social Studies also have  an extensive online component.  Resources such as these and IXL 
are utilized in classrooms, during lessons, for small groups, and students even have at-home online access for both students 
and parents, giving all access to the curriculum.  Furthermore, we have and provide school-wide access to BrainPop, 
BrainPopJr., and BrainPopESL for students to support learning. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Paste response to question here:   
 In the ENL classroom, native language support is delivered through providing students with a selection of reading genres in 
their native languages including Spanish, Russian, and Arabic.  These texts are in the ESL classroom bilingual libraries as well as 
in the Robinhood Library.  In addition, teachers use bilingual dictionaries, glossaries, internet access sites, and the use of 
cognates during instruction.  Students are also in flexible groups and are paired with other students who speak the same 
language but are at a different level of English proficiency, to assist with peer to peer translation and communication as 
needed.  In addition, we have many bilingual paraprofessionals in the building, some of whom are with specific ELL students as 
per their IEP. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Paste response to question here:  
  The ELL required services support ELL students’ ages and grade levels.  Teachers are sure to align the curriculum with the 
Common Core State Standards as appropriate to grade level expectations.  ELLs are held to the same standard as all other 
students present in a grade and are expected to succeed. The resources throughout the building are offered to ELLs 
throughout the grades.   In addition, ENL standalone services are provided to students in groups who are in two contiguous 
grades. Through careful programming, NYSESLAT analysis, and consideration for the CR-Part 154, students are placed by their 
age into the appropriate grade and then supported to ensure access to the curriculum. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Paste response to question here: 
Does not apply.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Paste response to question here:   
At this time, there are no specific activities planned before the beginning of the school year.  However, there is an ELL summer 
school program for students from grades 2-5 for currently enrolled ELLs who need extra support.  Throughout the school year, 
newly enrolled ELLs are supported with a Newcomer Kit, provided by the ELL Teachers.  This kit was put together by our ELL 
teachers and includes alphabet activities, a vocabulary dictionary, sight word lists, concept boards for vocabulary

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Paste response to question here:   
 
All teachers, including ENL and classroom teachers, guidance counselors, coordinators, and other service providers are offered 
professional development throughout the school year.  ENL and classroom teachers will continue to attend school based 
professional development workshops as well as those provided by the Department of Education and FSC. 
 
Some of the professional development sessions that have been offered/provided include training and learning about the 
following topics: 
 
 
As we meet the PD Committee develops the professional learning plan for year in an ongoing basis.  We include ELL personnel 
at the school, as well as all members of our staff.  We are also open to suggestions, feedback, and topics that staff would like 
to learn/develop in, as well as facilitators on topics of expertise.  The future Professional Development Plan is shared as it 
becomes available. 
 
Professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core State Learning 
Standards, as all teaching is aligned with the CCSS.  ELL teachers are encouraged to attend all professional learning activities in 
an effort to enhance their practice to accelerate the learning of our ELL students and get the students to meet the 
standards.  Similar professional learning activities as those listed above are to be offered.  In addition, teachers are encouraged 
to attend any professional development sessions offered by the Department of English Language Learners and learn from the 
Educator Resources provided as well.

total hours for all teachers will be ELL-specific.  Fifty percent of the total hours for ENL teachers will be ELL-specific.  
All teachers must have allotted training in ELL strategies and language acquisition to enhance their teaching and target our 
growing population of English language learners. 
 
Our teachers will attend professional development sessions focused on: 
 
All records of sign-in sheets, agendas, and resources are kept in a Professional Development Binder in our principal’s 
office.  Our Professional Development Committee plans accordingly to ensure that our school meets the required percentage 
of professional development necessary for all teachers. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Paste response to question here:   
The school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss the program, language development progress, 
language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  These meetings are not 
including the mandated parent orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent conferences, but are in addition to those.  At 
least once a year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences and initial parent orientations, teachers will schedule individual 
parent meetings, Annual Parent Meetings (AMP), to inform the parents and/or guardians about the child’s language 
development in all content areas in English.  All necessary staff will be required to be present during these meetings.  Such a 
meeting is conducted with a qualified translator/interpreter in the preferred language of the parent.  As a last resort, teachers 
and parents will hold this meeting/ have this conversation with a phone interview.  These meetings are to be held during 
Tuesday’s Parent Engagement time. 
 
Records are kept for annual individual meetings with ELL parents, as well as outreach to ensure parent needs are 
accommodated including parent phone calls, letters, e-mails, and in-person meetings.  A log of attendance will be kept on 
record and retained and stored in the ELL Folder of Critical Documents, which are sorted by year/grade.  
 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Paste response to question here:   
ELL parents are invited to ELL Parent Orientations and are encouraged to visit us during Parent-Teacher Conferences, in both 
the daytime and in the evening.  In addition, ELL parents will be invited for an annual individual meeting, as per the mandates 
of the CR-Part 154.  Parents are regularly scheduled to meet with teachers during parent engagement time on Tuesdays as 
necessary.  ELL parents are invited to join the Parent Teacher Association and participate in Edible Schoolyard Kitchen and 
Garden activities.  Our parent coordinator, also our Language Access Coordinator (LAC), offers parent workshops during the 
school year on a variety of topics.  In addition, parents are invited to meetings hosted by teachers, regarding standardized 
testing.  Parents are then informed about the exam and how to prepare their child.  PreK parents are also invited to a “Moving 
Up” meeting, where they are presented with the expectations for Kindergarten.  Parents are also encouraged to visit our 
school website to stay informed with school activities and/or events.  Our parent coordinator also has an open door 
policy.  The parents are welcome to come in and visit during any time of the day. 
 
P.S. 216 partners with the Shorefront YMCA to provide an ELL program for parents and extended family members.  This class 
meets two days a week, for approximately two hours each session during the school year, beginning in November through 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69

activities Monday through Friday. 
 
The needs of parents are evaluated by our Parent Coordinator, who is available to assist parent needing including Native 
Language and Translation support.  She acts as the liaison between the parent and teacher/school services and is available for 
all parent contact, as she has her own extension and can be reached before, during, and after school hours. 
 
PS 216 offers many options for all parents, including ELL parents.  At the start of the school year, all parents are invited to join 
the PTA and are encouraged to get involved with ongoing school activities, including our annual Leadership Day. Parents are 
invited to see students showcase their classrooms and experience student-led presentations.  This is part of The Leader in Me 
initiative in our school, which has a huge parent involvement piece. In addition, parents are informed of student expectations 
during Open School week, where they have the opportunity to view the classrooms, meet the teachers and other school staff, 
get an overview of the curriculum, and understand the goals of our school.  Parents are invited to view the class performances 
of readings, parades, showcases, and schoolyard activities.  Notices and letters are sent home to parents in English and 
translated to meet the language needs, if applicable.  Our school’s website can also translate in 50 different languages and 
robo-calls also go out in the parents’ preferred languages as entered into ATS.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Donna Neglia, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Multiple forms of data and several methodologies are used to assess the language preferences of the parent 
community for both written and oral communication. A language breakdown analysis using ATS was made to 
ascertain the home language needs based on Home Language Identification Survey forms for the entire school. 
The Home Language Identification Survey collects data as to the home language needs of student, but Part 3 is 
also indicative of the language of preference that parents would like to receive information from the school. The 
ATS report RAPL also gives the preferred language of parents. Any robo-calls from our school go out in ATS 
entered languages so that parents receive messages and notifications in their preferred language. The most 
recent, dominant languages in our school include Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Urdu, and Arabic. In addition, parents 
are also asked to indicate their language of preference on the Emergency Blue Cards for each student, which are 
kept in the main office and organized by class. Furthermore, to ensure that all parents are provided with 
immediate translation, when necessary, we have bilingual paraprofessionals and other staff members that are 
bilingual in the building. In addition, we have ongoing access to the NYC Translation and Interpretation Unit to 
ensure that parents always have access to a translator/interpreter. Our Language Access Coordinator is also our

Parent Coordinator and ensures that every parent have the language translation and interpretation necessary. In 
addition, P.S. 216’s school website can also translate into 50 different languages.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency, our school’s communication strategy to reach LEP Families include “to-go blue 
card box,” which includes all student information as well as the parent’s preferred language. Parents are contacted 
used bilingual staff members and/or the Language Translation Interpretation Unit. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 that established procedures to ensure that LEP parents are 
provided with meaningful opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their 
child’s education. Our Language Access Coordinator (LAC) is also our Parent Coordinator and provides language access 
to support LEP families and parents on and ongoing basis. In addition, the Translation and Interpretation Unit helps 
the NYC Department of Education work with families who need help communicating in English. Our school has 
ensured that all staff members are aware of how to use translation services and the over-the-phone interpretation 
service by the ELL teachers and the parent coordinator who have provided information as to how to use the Language 
and Translation Unit. Staff members have been given a packet that includes information about the unit, their phone 
number, and other information. We also have a poster in the main lobby informing parents of translation services 
available. 

At P.S. 216, our Translation Budget is used through a DOE approved vendor, The Big Word. We access critical 
documents that are already translated on the intranet. In addition, we hire bilingual staff members to attend parent 
meetings to assist in interpretation and translation needs for our dominant languages.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

 

Our school aims to meet identified translation needs as indicated in Part B. Procedures are set in place to ensure a 
timely provision of translated documents to parents. Written translation and interpretation of documents are 
provided by the Translation and Interpretation Unit and/or an in-house school staff member that is bilingual, based on 
need, individual circumstance, and language. Letters to be translated by the Language Translation and Interpretation 
Unit are sent from the LAC to the Unit for translation ahead of time, to allow for time to translate. In-house 
translators are present at meetings to translate and communicate with parents concerning the information in written 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

documents that may be distributed during that time. Parents are also encouraged to bring a friend/family member to 
translate for them. 

Procedures are set in place to ensure that oral interpretation services are available immediately for parents. Oral 
translation and interpretation support are provided by the Translation and Interpretation Unit and/or an in-house 
school staff member that is bilingual, based on need, individual circumstance, and language. This is planned ahead of 
time by teachers and staff, and the LAC is notified of any translation services that are anticipated. The LAC is very 
competent in having the translation and interpretations available upon request. 

Paraprofessionals and parent volunteers are available to translate in languages such as Russian, Spanish, Urdu, and 
Arabic. If translators are needed, they can and will be hired for translation services. In the case of an immediate 
translation need, the NYC Translation and Interpretation Unit can be reached to get a translator on the phone to 
speak to a parent. Vendors are used for IEP meeting purposes and budgeting is provided for these services. 

In addition, translated signage is throughout our school building, mainly in the sign-in areas, security, and the main 
office. The Parent Bill if Rights are also posted in all available languages. 

Our school fulfills the parental notification requirements for translation and interpretation services, as per Section VII 
of Chancellor’s Regulations A-633. The following is a checklist of Notification Requirements: 

  Welcome Poster 
  Parents’ Bill of Rights 
  Parents’ Guide to Language Access 
 
  Registration documents and other notifications will be available in both English and the home language, as 

Language ID Guide at the security desk and main office 

needed. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

 

Our school gathers feedback from all parents, including LEP parents, on the language services by reviewing data from 
our Parent Surveys. According to the 2017-2018 school quality snapshot, approximately 90% of families feel that 
parents are given support and there is open communication. 

We implement this feedback by updating data and information in ATS on an ongoing basis, as necessary. In addition, if 
there is a need for further documents to be translated in additional languages, the appropriate accommodations are 
made.
