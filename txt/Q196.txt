Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our vision is to create an environment in which we prepare our children for the future, by educating the whole child; 
allowing for collaboration among our teachers to ensure best practices, so students can achieve the highest 
standards; and working with parents as partners.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS196 is an elementary (PK-5) school with approximately 982 students, in Forest Hills, Queens. As of June 2018, our 
population is 36.9% Asian, 12.0% Hispanic, 2.3% Black, 42.2% White, 0.3% American Indian, 0.10% Hawaiian, and 6.2% 
multiracial. We have 12.0% of students who receive special education services, and 10.6% who are learning English as 
a New Language. We expect our school population to grow to more than 1,000 students in September 2018, with 
similar percentages. 

We have strategic partnerships with community based organizations (CBO), including Queens College, which supplies 
our school with student teachers, Marquis Studios for Project Arts, Dancing Classrooms and Wellness in the 
Classroom. 

We have been recognized as one of the top performing New York City elementary schools. We ensure that our 
curriculum is relevant and rigorous. In other words, the curriculum is cognitively demanding and challenging to 
students, as they apply the essential concepts and skills to real-world, complex and open-ended problems. The 
content is not just engaging to students, but truly pushes their thinking. When students successfully meet these 
challenges, their learning has meaning and value in contexts well beyond the current unit or classroom setting. 

Based on our 2015-2016 Quality Review, we were well-developed in all five indicators--1.1 (Curriculum), 1.2 
(Pedagogy), 2.2 (Assessment), 3.4 (High Expectations), and 4.2 (Teacher Teams). The reviewer found that we align all 
of our curriculum to the Common Core Learning Standards and Instructional Shifts, to meet the needs of all students, 
including students with disabilities and English Language Learners. 

Even though we have excelled in many areas, we are always looking for ways to improve what we do to meet the 
needs of all students. To that end, we are focusing on the following areas for the 2018-2019 school year, as aligned 
with the Framework for Great Schools: 1) To increase the quality of rigorous instruction through the design and 
implementation of challenging tasks, 2) To promote inclusivity (LGBTQ, special needs, cultural diversity) within 
classrooms and across our school community, 3) To ensure that teachers have access to relevant and differentiated 
professional learning, aligned with their goals, to grow their practice, 4) To strengthen the school-wide culture of 
shared and distributive leadership by having teachers assume leadership roles, and 5) To further opportunities for 
parents to serve as partners with the school, promoting their children's academic and social development. 

Embedded within each of our goals is our ongoing emphasis on trust, open accountability and communication. 
Without the trust of all our constituents (teachers, staff, parents and students), we would not be the school we are 
today. We incorporate the values of transparency, shared leadership, a respect for all voices and a “we’re-in-it-
together attitude” into all we do. We believe that the underlying trust we have created and continue to nurture, is at 
the root of our success. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Over the past 10 years, our special education population has grown considerably. For the 2018-2019 school year, we 
will have a collaborative classroom on each grade (two in kindergarten and two in second grade), as well as three self-
contained classrooms (Grades K/1/2, Grade 3, and Grades 4/5). These students need varying levels of support from 
our providers (counselor, speech therapists, occupational therapists, physical therapists, IEP teacher, etc.). In order to 
ensure that their needs are met, we have increased the number of days for our counselor and social worker. We have 
also, over the past few years, added another full-time speech therapist and a part-time occupational therapy 
provider. 

Our ENL (English as a New Language) population has also grown dramatically, especially as new laws were 
implemented. Per New York State law, we provide mandated services for students for two additional years after they 
reach a Commanding level on the NYSESLAT. In September 2016, we brought on an additional full-time ENL teacher, 
in order to meet the needs of all the additional students. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

For both our ENL and special needs students to succeed, we work diligently to ensure that our classroom teachers are 
informed about best practices in these areas. Teachers receive professional learning about academic and behavior 
interventions (when necessary), as well as supports for non-English speakers. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Last year, we made progress across all elements of the Framework for Great Schools. We increased the quality of 
rigorous instruction through the implementation of Roland Case's Critical Thinking. We implemented, Sanford-
Harmony, a school-wide program for supporting students' social-emotional growth. Working collaboratively in 
teacher teams, our staff focused on the the development of high-quality lessons, in order to meet the academic needs 
of all students. Teachers took on additional leadership responsibilities by piloting new initiatives, including STEM 
Night and the Green Team, an environmental club. We increased opportunities for parent involvement, through the 
redesign of the parent-teacher team, which developed new ways to strengthen the home-school connection. 

This year, we will be focusing on the following: 1) To increase the quality of rigorous instruction through the design 
and implementation of challenging tasks, 2) To promote inclusivity (LGBTQ, special needs, cultural diversity) within 
classrooms and across our school community, 3) To ensure that teachers have access to relevant and differentiated 
professional learning, aligned with their goals, to grow their practice, 4) To strengthen the school-wide culture of

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
We are a high-performing school with 80% of our students scoring at, or above grade level on the 2017 New York 
State English Language Arts assessments, and 87% on the math. According to the 2017-2018 School Learning 
Environment Survey, PS 196 received a 92% positive response rate in the Rigorous Instruction category. This is an 
increase from 87% last year. All parent and teacher responses were well above citywide averages.  

 

According to the Measures of Leadership Practice Summative Feedback SY 2017-2018, our teachers' pedagogy 
shows clear evidence of differentiation practices, student engagement, student discussion and assessment. All 
procedures are aligned to curricula and show a clear and consistent shared understanding throughout the school of 
how students learn best. 

According to our latest Quality Review, our school scored a Well - Developed in Instructional Core area 1.1 - Ensure 
engaging, rigorous, and coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to 
Common Core Learning Standards and/or content standards.  

Based on teacher observations and unit plan trends we have found that students are more engaged in hands-on 
lessons in the classroom. As a result of teacher collaboration and an emphasis on rigor in planning, students work 
in cooperative groups and partnerships to engage in productive struggle in order to promote high levels of student-
led conversation. 

Despite all of the positive metrics, we are committed to continuing to find ways to increase rigor in our classrooms. 
This year, teachers will focus on planning and implementing tasks (project based learning--PBL) that challenge 
students and incorporate higher-level thinking, questioning and problem solving. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers will support students in their ability to access and successfully complete challenging tasks, 
engaging them in rigorous instruction. This will be measured by an increase of one level for at least 20% of students 
on performance-based assessments in ELA and math.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will receive professional learning on all aspects of the 
SOLVE strategy. This problem-solving protocol can be used by 
students in all curricular areas through high-level questioning. 

Teacher teams will collaboratively analyze student work and 
design challenging tasks and projects to engage students to 
problem solve and become independent critical thinkers. 

TRUST: Working as teams, teachers develop further trust as they 
recognize that the end goal is student progress, rather than any 
competition among colleagues. 

 

Teachers will model for the students how to use and give 
constructive feedback. The Reading /Writing Strategies Books by 
Jennifer Serravallo will serve as a professional resource. In 
addition, teachers will use this resource to deepen their 
understanding of effective reading and writing strategies that 
will be implemented to support the reading needs and writing of 
students with disabilities and English Language Learners.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
A pivotal part of our school vision that we are responsible for educating the whole child--both academically and 
social-emotionally. According to our annual survey of students, we already have a school environment in which every 
student has someone they can count on--whether it is their teacher, an administrator, a service provider, an office 
staff member or our security agent.  

As written in the 2017-2018 Measures of Leadership Practice Summative Feedback: "The learning environment shows 
clear indications of mutual trust and collaboration resulting in an inclusive culture of shared accountability. 
Channeling various resources and personnel, each student is supported both academically, as well as in social-
emotional growth, maximizing the impact of this work on student achievement." 

In the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey, the vast majority of teachers felt that our school establishes a culture 
where students feel safe, are challenged to grow, and supported to meet high expectations. In 18 categories, teachers 
agree or strongly agree with the positive statements about supportive environment at a rate of 92%, or above. 

Although our results on key metrics are extremely positive in this area, we are always looking for ways to improve. 
With the general culture becoming more aware and open about LGBTQ issues, and with more gender non-conforming 
students entering our building, we wanted to make sure that our staff was informed about the language and best 
practices in this area. Our efforts through our new Inclusivity Committee reach beyond this sphere to encompass 
special needs students and to acknowledge the wide range of cultures that makes up our population. We will 
continue to use the social-emotional development program, Sanford Harmony, which we launched last year, as a 
cornerstone for this work. The Inclusivity Committee has been tasked with developing a school policy on acceptance 
of all students and promoting the use of best practices in ALL classrooms (Pre-K through 5th grade). The Committee 
will also give teachers specific tools they can use in the classroom to support openness and acceptance of ALL people. 
They will also create workshops for parents on these topics. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

By June 2019, 100% of our staff's observations in Advance will include evidence of best practices for inclusivity and 
equity (recognition of implicit bias and acceptance of LGBTQ, special needs and cultural diversity), as per Danielson's 
2a--Creating an Environment of Respect and Rapport.

strategies your school will implement to achieve the 
identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools 
element, including:

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

A new committee was created in June 2018, to address all 
aspects of inclusivity and equity, including recognition of 
implicit bias and LGBTQ issues, special needs issues and 
multicultural issues. The objectives of the committee are to 
create a school policy on inclusivity and equity and to 
promote best practices throughout the school. Initiatives 
already planned for the 2018-2019 school year include: 
implicit bias and equity training; an inclusive, school-wide 
book of the month; gender neutral bathroom passes; no 
longer using boys/girls lines; explorations of foods and 
customs of students within classrooms; and open discussions 
about different ways people learn. 

Teachers will continue to use the Sanford Harmony, which 
we launched in our school last year. This social-emotional 
development program encompasses all aspects of multi-
culturalism and inclusivity. TRUST: Trust is an integral part of 
this character development program, and will be highlighted 
at all levels (student, teacher, parent) throughout the year. 

Students, including ENLs and SWDs, will continue to connect 
to Sanford Harmony through direct instruction by their 
teachers. The program includes a clearly laid out scope and 
sequence for all grades and recommends one period of 
character instruction per week.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the Measures of Leadership Practice SY 2017-2018, teacher teams consistently engage in collaboration 
and inquiry that strengthens pedagogy and builds overall capacity. This includes several methods of distributive 
leadership and the collection of student data to drive instruction. 

We believe that through collaboration and an inquiry-based approach, teachers will have opportunities to work 
productively with colleagues designing lessons, rigorous tasks, and analyzing student work. This type of teamwork 
contributes to a greater sense of trust and it allows teachers to share their knowledge and best practices to engage 
students in learning. 

Based on our 2018 School Survey, 92% of teachers said that their professional development experiences have 
included enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas. 74% of teachers felt that they had the 
opportunity to work with teachers from other other schools. We determined there is a need to build even more 
collaboration among teachers across grade levels. Additionally, inter-visitations (within the school and outside the 
school) enable teachers to share best practices which ultimately leads to an increase in student achievement. 

All of our work in this area will be focused on teacher's individual goals for improving their practice. Through a 
beginning-of-year survey, we will determine the topics that teachers want to engage in, and make sure that their 
professional learning experiences are driven by that data. We will survey the teachers again (mid-year and end-of-
year) to ensure that they are getting what they need to become even better educators. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 80% of teachers will affirm that they participated in meaningful, individualized and differentiated 
professional learning, aligned to their professional learning goals, as measured by school-created teacher surveys.

instructional focus of engaging students in learning, as well as 
teachers' own professional goals. 

Teachers will collaborate with colleagues during inquiry time, 
common planning times, and vertical team meetings with a focus 
on the progressions of ELA and Mathematics topics and how 
concepts develop across grade levels.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Schools will improve for the benefit of every student only when every leader and every teacher is a member of one or 
more strong teams that create synergy in problem solving, provide emotional and practical support, distribute 
leadership to better tap the talents of members of the school community, and promote the interpersonal 
accountability that is necessary for continuous improvement. Such teamwork not only benefits students, it also 
creates the supportive leadership and the process and time for meaningful collaboration that enables teachers to 
thrive and are better able to address the complex challenges of their work. Strategic analysis of student data is 
essential to measure the impact of various strategies and pedagogical practices on student outcomes. When teacher 
teams consistently analyze student data, they can collaborate and use this information to inform their instruction and 
plan units and lessons to meet student needs across the grades. This creates shared accountability among teaching 
staff as they need to work together in vertical teams to move students through the curriculum and ensure alignment 
and cohesion across grades. 

According to the 2017-2018 Measures of Leadership Practice, we consistently engage in collaboration and inquiry that 
strengthens pedagogy and builds overall capacity. This includes several methods of distributive leadership and the 
collection of student data to drive instruction. We have incorporated teacher input and recommendations in the 
selection of instructional materials. For example, Kindergarten and first grade teachers were involved in the decision 
to launch TC Reading and Writing. Additionally, 100% of our teachers participated in teacher vertical teams. Many of 
our teachers assumed the leadership roles on these teams. This created many opportunities for meaningful 
collaboration and problem solving.   

Although we are performing well in this area we would like to expand on it in several ways. We will be giving teachers 
opportunities to take more leadership roles in developing their instructional strategies. In order to accomplish this, 
school administrators will provide feedback to teachers recommending that they attend professional development 
workshops and turnkey information to their colleagues. We will be encouraging inter-visitations so that teachers can 
receive feedback from their colleagues and have more opportunities to reflect on their practice. Teachers will also 
continue to be given time to meet with their grade level colleagues and vertical teams to share their reflections and 
collaborate on solutions.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27 

 

By June 2019, the administration will strengthen the school-wide culture of shared and distributive leadership and 
leverage staff strength by having 85% of teachers participate in activities where they assume leadership roles as 
measured by turnkeys to staff, agendas, minutes, and teacher reflection forms.

School leaders will consult with team leaders to ensure their 
work is in alignment with school and it's vision. Additionally, 
school leaders will share what they are working on and their 
findings through the creation of teacher resources/toolkits on 
GAFE, newsletters, and through Share Fairs on Professional 
Learning Mondays. 

School leaders will make sure that teams have access to a wide 
variety resources and professional development they can use in 
order to ensure that they systematically analyze key elements of 
classroom practice and strategically focus on the deficiency 
standards in ELA and math.  

One purpose of the vertical teams is to ensure cohesion across 
grade levels and classrooms. Therefore, we will continue to 
utilize GAFE as a tool in which minutes, agendas, and 
presentations can be posted and made accessible to all staff at 
all times. 

The Parent-Teacher Team, along with school leadership, will 
develop relationships with community-based organizations and 
provide opportunities for parents to assume leadership roles by 
presenting workshops to the school community on topics in 
which they can share their knowledge and expertise.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to several research studies that looked at parent involvement, regardless of family income or background, 
students with involved parents are more likely to earn higher grades and test scores, and enroll in higher-level 
programs. They are more likely to be promoted, pass their classes, and earn credits. They are also more likely to 
attend school regularly, have better social skills, show improved behavior, adapt well to school, and graduate and go 
on to post-secondary education. 

Last year we redesigned the focus of the Parent-Teacher Team. This team helped to develop new ways to increase 
parent participation at school workshops. This year we want to expand on this by including a teacher from each grade 
level on the team to increase school wide participation. Team members will research and begin cultivating 
relationships with community based organizations. We will incorporate technology into parent engagement by 
making families aware of academic workshops via various social media outlets. Research shows that social media 
usage is increasing among adults. This will increase the likelihood that parents are informed of upcoming workshops 
and events. Additionally, a parent resources reference document will be developed for community programs in order 
to strengthen and support students’ learning and well-being. 

This year we launched two new and highly successful events. We hosted our first annual STEM night, which included 
stations that provided opportunities for students to interact with teachers and parents. Students learned about 
science, technology, engineering and math through fun and engaging activities. We also expanded our wellness 
initiative by having students grow their own vegetables in our school garden. Students were invited to attend cooking 
classes with their parents to learn how to prepare delicious and healthy meals.  

Parent engagement is critical in a child’s journey to becoming a strong and independent adult. Truly engaged parents 
help educators do their job better. Based on the school survey 93% of families say they are likely to attend a general 
school meeting or general school event. We would like to build on our success and further increase participation. To 
help us achieve our goal of increased parent participation, we will utilize Parent Engagement Wednesdays as an 
opportunity for students to take part in student-led conferences. Students will use the time to share with their 
parents their strengths and needs in class.  

Parents successfully partner with the school in connecting expectations to the college and career readiness for all 
students through their support; such as, strategic reading with a list of pre, during, and post questions that parents 
can ask their children during reading at home. We will also continue to foster home-school connections through 
events and programs like monthly Family Fun Fridays, Career Day, Family Math Night, STEM Night, Culminating Art 
Residency Events, wellness committee and Carnival Day. 

Based on 2017-18 parent workshop attendance statistics, we need to vary workshop offerings and presentation 
times. We will also have presentations and materials available for parents online.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, parent and family participation at workshops will increase by 5% as the school community seeks to 
enhance and build new opportunities for parents to become partners in the academic and social-emotional 
development of their children. This goal will be measured by parent attendance statistics.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 196 Grand Central Parkway, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

[School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46

children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

There will be four programs included in the Title III Plan.  The first program is entitled "For the 
Love of Literature," the second is "Getting Ready," the third is "Family ENL Class," and the 
fourth is "Sunday Academy for ELLs." The language of instruction for all four programs will be 
English.  The goal for all four programs is to move the students toward full and strong 
proficiency in English by providing cognitively challenging tasks and activities in an 
academically rigorous learning environment.  The instruction will be differentiated based upon 
the data provided by NYSESLAT 2018 scores, Periodic Assessment scores (Fall 
2018), NYSITELL scores (Fall 2018), Teacher's College reading levels, and upon their 
classroom needs as per Classroom and ENL teacher evaluations. All programs will be instructed 
by Judith Riccardo and/or Allyse Gulotta.  They are licensed NY State TESOL teachers.  There 
will be a supervisor present and paid for through Title III funding, unless there is another 
program that is running at the same time, in which case the supervisor will be paid for through 
the funds from the other program. 
 
 
The first program, "For the Love of Literature", is designed to target newcomers at the 
Transitioning and Expanding levels of English language proficiency.  The program is aimed at 
providing literary vocabulary and activities to scaffold our students from grades 3-5 and best 
prepare them for the challenges they will encounter navigating the ELA curriculum and 
ultimately the NYS ELA Exam.  The students participating in this program will all have been in 
an English Language School System for three or fewer years, officially making them 
newcomers.  This class will meet for two sessions per week for a total of 3 hours per week.  It 
will begin in January and end in February.  It will meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:00-
4:30 with 10-12 student participants. Student materials will include, but not be limited to, 
notebooks (for working with vocabulary and trying out and practicing different writing 
structures), and computers (for research and writing activities).  We will provide a paperback 
novel; Sarah Plain and Tall.  We will explore literary elements while meeting Common Core 
Learning Standards throughout our novel study.  Students will hear read alouds, have grand 
conversations, create experience charts, use thinking maps, utilize various writing graphic 
organizers, and use technology, such as the SMARTboard, iPads, and computers.  The materials 
they use in this program will differ from the materials they use during their ELA classes and 
ENL lessons in the school day.  However, the continual communication between classroom 
teachers and our ENL teachers will aid in driving instruction to support our ELLs in this 
program.  Furthermore, our ENL staff will turn-key all professional learning experiences.  This 
will support the students by providing the necessary skills and information to succeed in their 
daytime programs outside of their mandated ENL minutes.  The newly acquired literary 
knowledge will serve to strengthen students' abilities, even on the NYS Math and Science exams, 
by helping them interpret and respond to short and long answer questions eloquently.   
The second program, "Getting Ready", will begin in February and end in March. The class will 
meet for two sessions per week for a total of 3 hours per week.  It will meet on Tuesdays and 
Thursdays from 3:00-4:30. There will be approximately 10-12 student participants and will

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
include only the students who scored at the Transitioning and Expanding levels on either the 
Spring 2018 NYSESLAT or the Fall 2018 NYSITELL.   The students will be from grades 3 - 
5.  The class will utilize materials such as workbooks, CDs, SMARTboard lessons, computer 
lessons, iPads, and practice materials to help the students sharpen their skills and strategies when 
answering both multiple choice and short answer language questions.  The students will 
complete a variety of tasks that will include, but not be limited to, the use of appropriate poetry, 
trade books, grammar games and puzzles (found both online and in grammar texts), recipes, 
photos (as story or conversation starters), and pre-writing and writing activities. These materials 
will be gathered from texts, workbooks, classroom libraries, and from online sites.  The 
Professional Learning that the ENL teachers, Judith Riccardo and Allyse Gulotta, receive from 
the Technology Teacher, Ellen Phillips, will provide an individualized and targeted learning 
experience for the students.   
 
The third program, "Sunday Academy for ELLs", will include students and their parents.  The 
parents will join their children in learning strategies and skills.  There will be a clear explanation 
of expectations and full support for testing.  We will include parent volunteer translators in the 
high need languages based upon the scheduled participants after parent outreach has been 
completed.  We will initially send letters with tear off responses inviting parents and their 
children to participate in this program.  We will follow up the invitations with phone calls and/or 
parent meetings as needed. Once we have determined the high need languages, we will arrange 
for peer parent mentors/translators.  Additionally, we will use technology to assist in 
translation.  We will take advantage of materials already in place at no extra cost.  We previously 
invested in bilingual glossaries, dictionaries, and phrasebooks.  The class will meet on two 
separate Sundays in the Spring before the NYSESLAT and before the ELA tests are 
administered from 8:00 am-12:30 pm.  The tentative dates for this program are Sunday, March 
10 and Sunday, March 17.  There will be materials available for the parents to use at home with 
their children to positively impact their ability to support their child in ENL class, on classroom 
tests and class work, on the NYSESLAT, and on the ELA exam.  These materials will be grade 
appropriate in order to let the parents have a sense of the expectations for an English language 
proficient student in New York State in the same grade as their child.  These materials will be 
supplemental and distinct from those used for daily instruction in the ENL program. 
 
The fourth program, "Family ENL Class", will include students and their parents.  This class is 
geared toward aiding our newcomer students and parents in acquiring the necessary vocabulary 
and language skills needed to navigate through our school community.  The language of 
instruction will be English.  This group will meet September to October on Friday mornings at 
7:00-8:00 a.m.  Mrs. Riccardo will teach the parent group and Ms. Gulotta will teach the student 
group.  At the culmination of each session, the groups will be brought together to utilize their 
newly obtained knowledge.  In order to successfully present each lesson, the ENL teachers will 
be using an array of materials, such as interactive lessons on the SMARTboard, iPads, 
computers, digital translators, visual support, teacher-created resources, and corresponding 
textbooks and workbooks. 
 
Accurate records will be maintained by Mrs. Riccardo and Ms. Gulotta regarding attendance, 
parent invitations (bilingually), and parent responses.  They will create attendance sheets with 
the dates for each class scheduled on the top of the columns and student participant names 
written down the far left column.

Begin description here:            
The Title III ENL teachers, Judith Riccardo and Allyse Gulotta, will meet with a classroom 
teacher on grade levels 3, 4, and 5.  The ENL teachers will tentatively meet with Jayne Golub, 
Grade 3 teacher, on Thursday, December 6th from 3:00-5:00 p.m.  They will tentatively meet 
with Jasmine Bajraktari, Grade 4 teacher, on Monday, December 3rd from 3:00-5:00 p.m.  The 
ENL teachers are tentatively scheduled to have Professional Learning with Heather Wellbrock, 
Special Education and Grade 5 teacher, on Monday November 26th from 3:00-5:00 
p.m. Together, classroom teachers and ENL teachers will review the Common Core Curriculum 
needs for the students participating in the Title III Program. Classroom teachers will provide 
Mrs. Riccardo and Ms. Gulotta with Professional Learning regarding specific content goals and 
vocabulary on each grade level that the students will need to support their continued and future 
successes in their academic studies.  They will additionally work together to modify and develop 
instructional units, which provide hands-on experiences that will benefit ENL students and are 
aligned to each grade curriculum. 
 
Mrs. Riccardo and Ms. Gulotta will additionally meet with our Technology Specialist, Ellen 
Phillips, tentatively scheduled for  Monday, December 10th from 3:00-5:00 p.m. and Thursday, 
December 13th from 3:00-5:00 p.m.  Ms. Phillips will provide her technological expertise and 
share and guide them toward appropriate digital resources tailored to meet the needs of ENL 
students.  As a result of this collaboration, the students will be able to create multimedia 
presentations using a variety of age-appropriate applications and child-friendly programs. 
 
All teachers involved in the Professional Learning (PL) will benefit and gain knowledge through 
this Professional Learning experience. Conversations and ideas will be shared during the PL 
sessions and the ENL specialists will have an opportunity to provide the other specialists with 
suggestions and ideas for best practices for supporting the ELLs that they encounter in their 
regular day while teaching. 
 
Additionally, at no cost to the Title III funding, Mrs. Riccardo and Ms. Gulotta are planning and 
integrating into general education classrooms containing ELLs and providing PL for these 
General Education classroom teachers weekly during their planning sessions.  They will work 
together toward bringing the academic language and content specific vocabulary to the ELLs via 
visual support, scaffolded activities, and other methodologies like Total Physical Response 
(TPR). The emphasis is on reading and academic writing. The classroom teachers, Mrs. 
Riccardo, and Ms. Gulotta will team side by side in the classroom teachers’ classrooms. Our 
ENL Teachers will continue their research and learning of best practices by attending monthly 
workshops lead by Queens South Field Support Center for ELL Support personnel and by 
attending other workshops and viewing links that are recommended by Queens South Field 
Support Center.  They will turnkey the information that they have gleaned from these and other 
news, studies, and reports with the staff at P.S. 196.

Begin description here:            
"Sunday Academy for ELLs" will be held on two Sundays in the Spring.  This will run from 8:00 
a.m. - 12:30 p.m.  "Family ENL Class" will be held on Friday mornings from 7:00 a.m. - 8:00 
a.m.  starting in January and ending in March.  Both programs are open to all leveled ELLs on 
Grades K-5 and their parents.  Each student must have an adult in attendance for these 
programs.  
 
These sessions will be designed to prepare the students and their parents for quicker language 
acquisition by providing tasks, strategies, academic language, and vocabulary to enhance their 
learning. Parents and their children will be working in pairs.  They will use materials designed to 
strengthen skills in English Language Arts. The materials will be appropriate for the specific 
student/parent teams who are participating.  These language skills will additionally serve to 
strengthen the ELLs' test taking skills on all City and State tests as they enrich their 
vocabulary.  Parents will also be made aware of the high expectations for English language 
proficiency on the NYSESLAT.  They will learn that these expectations are equal to and 
sometimes surpass the expectations of the ELA exam.  The "Sunday Academy for ELLs" will 
additionally serve to help ELLs and their parents navigate, prepare, and become knowledgeable 
about the State and City tests.  It is designed to provide families of ELLs with strategies to 
promote continuing improvement in English language proficiency.  The "Family ENL Class" 
will additionally serve to help ELLs and their parents navigate through our school community.   
 
Parents will initially be invited to attend these programs via letters, which will go home with 
their children in the black folder.  (The black folder is a school wide policy that ensures a strong 
school/home connection.  Each child has a black folder, provided by the school, which is used to 
send notes or other correspondence to student homes and from homes to school.  Parents have 
provided a black folder for their child or the school has provided a black folder. Every child has 
this folder that is designated for communication between school and home and visa versa.) The 
letters will be distributed in both English and in the parents' home languages.  We will use 
Translation Services to translate the letters into the necessary home languages. The invitation 
letters will have a tear off, which every child participating, or not, must return.  The tear off will 
indicate if the child will participate with their parent and if not will be asked "Why not?"  The 
ENL teachers, Mrs. Riccardo and Ms. Gulotta, will maintain records to insure that all have been 
returned. The next phase will be for Mrs. Riccardo and Ms. Gulotta to reach out to parents by 
telephone.  They will contact parents who have not responded and/or parents who have 
responded "no" to see if we can help make "no" responses into "yes" responses by helping to 
solve their conflict. The communication will be documented and maintained by 
Mrs. Riccardo and Ms. Gulotta and will be stored in the ELL classroom file cabinet.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses TCRWP to level our students and find out what reading level they are on.  We use this information to 
determine how much vocabulary an ELL knows, how well the ELL can spell grade appropriate words, how well the ELL can 
comprehend a story and retell it. We also see if a child can follow directions.  All of these assessments provide valuable insights 
for the teachers as they plan lessons. If a student tests at a low level a teacher can adjust the lessons to include definitions of 
words and add activities that will lead students to discover different word families for strengthening spelling skills. Our school 
will use MOSL scores from the beginning of the year to help plan instruction. The most recent NYSESLAT scores will be used to 
determine instruction for our Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, and Commanding level English language learners.  
 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Google Apps for Education (GAFE) is used as a structured communication tool in order to make co-planning successful.  GAFE 
supports formal and informal co-planning in the co-teaching structure by allowing the ENL teachers to view ELL’s TC levels, 
curriculum maps, and student work.  GAFE is also utilized to support co-teaching by creating easy availability for co-planning as 
teachers needn’t be physically together.  Classroom teachers can share grade-wide documents so that the ENL teachers can 
better support the students through differentiation.  This structure is used in addition to regular co-planning time.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
In order to evaluate the success of our ENL programs, we use various data sources (formative and summative,) qualitative to 
quantitative.  We never rely on one measure to let us know if our ELL program is working.   Assessments we use include: 
NYSESLAT, ELL Periodic Assessments, Periodic Assessments, TCRWP Assessments, New York State Assessments, 
student/teacher conference notes, and student portfolios.  If a student with disabilities is also an ENL, we look for ways to 
integrate him into general education classrooms, whenever possible. Our MOSL testing, and NYSESLAT and NYSITELL scores 
are clear indications of our success in meeting AYP for our ELLs because these are evaluations that are given toward the 
beginning of the school year or, in the case of the NYSESLAT; yearly.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once our summative data has been gathered, our ENL Team (consisting of classroom teachers and ENL staff) meets to work 
together towards determining appropriate interventions to support our ELLs.  For example, the data gathered through 
summative assessment aids co-teaching teams in driving small group instruction.    
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 196 uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the RTI framework.  All students, including ELLs, are screened 
for RTI using the TC running records.  Tier two interventions include Wilson/Fundations programs.  Tier three interventions 
include math and literacy intervention coaches and the Leveled Literacy Intervention Program.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
One way to measure our students’ progress toward proficiency is to compare their NYSESLAT scores from 2017 administration 
to the 2018 administration.  Another way is to compare their NYSITELL scores from when they arrived in the 2017-2018 school 
year to their NYSESLAT 2018 scores. The ELLs at P.S. 196Q made great progress. 
 
We currently have 24 ELLs in grade one. This includes 17 that attended P.S. 196Q for Kindergarten.  Of these students, 15 
moved up in their English language levels as per the 2018 NYSESLAT. One student arrived after the NYSESLAT was administered 
and didn't take it. One remained on the same level after arriving just weeks before the state test. 12 of the 15 children that 
moved up in level moved up to the Commanding level in year 1.  Two ELLs remained at the same level and were held over, 
repeating Grade One.  Of our current 19 Grade Two students, 1 is at the Commanding level in year 1, and 11 are at the 
Commanding level in year 2.  All but 3 students improved their ENL level on the 2018 NYSESLAT.  Two of these 3 students are 
currently sitting in a Self-Contained Special Education Grade Two classroom.  The third child arrived in April 2017 from 
Russia.  There are 20 English language learners in our Grade Three.  7 of these children are at the Commanding level in year 1, 
and 5 are at the Commanding level in year 2.  All but one child moved up their ENL levels.  The child who did not move up a 
level is currently beginning her second year in a Self-Contained Special Education Grade Three classroom.  Our current Grade 
Four has 8 ENL students.  3 of these children are at the Commanding level in year 1 and 1 child is at the Commanding level in 
year 2.  All children who took the 2017 NYSESLAT improved their ENL levels.  2 of these children are new to America.  Our 
current grade five has 13 ENL students.  3 of these children are at the Commanding level in year 1 and 2 of these children are 
at the Commanding level in year 2.  2 students are new to America and 1 is a transfer from another DOE school.  All children 
moved up their ENL level on the 2017 NYSESLAT.  Our students are consistently moving toward English language proficiency as 
measured by the NYSESLAT and the NYSITELL. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In September, we are able to utilize the NYSESLAT test results.  We view the NYSESLAT test results on an Excel spreadsheet, 
which includes information detailing all previous administrations of the NYSESLAT for each student.  This allows the ENL 
teachers to compare and determine our ELL’s progress towards language proficiency.  We use the data to drill down and 
determine students’ language specific needs and strengths.  The ENL teachers evaluate all four language modalities separately 
for each English language learner.  For example, if the data were to indicate that our P.S. 196 ELL population tended to excel in 
their Reading and Listening language modalities, we would adjust our program to provide more support in Speaking and 
Writing skills.    

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

During the regular instructional school day at P.S. 196Q, ELLs participate in a formal Freestanding ENL Program 
according to the criteria of the NYS guidelines.  Students are required to meet NYS ENL Standards for Reading, 
Writing, Listening and Speaking.  The instructional model for this program is a combination of Integrated and Stand 
Alone, which provide small group, differentiated instruction. Depending on student needs, they will be given a 
combination of Stand Alone, and/or Integrated ENL services.  Students eligible for ENL services may receive additional 
enrichment during morning and/or after-school programs. 
Our ENL program features students of heterogeneous or mixed proficiency levels in each class. Most classes are using 
the Integrated model affording the students the opportunity to work side by side with English language proficient 
students. The teachers plan lessons together to support the second language learning skills of the ELLs and to 
strengthen the skills of the English language proficient students.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Students have been programmed based on their NYSELAT and NYSITELL results and based on the revised CR Part 154.2.   
 
We currently have 7 Kindergarten students receiving Stand Alone ENL instruction for 180 minutes per week and 21 receiving 
Integrated Instruction for 180 minutes per week.  Of those 21 children; 5 are at the Entering Level, 2 are Emerging, 4 are at the 
Transitioning Level, and 10 are at the Expanding Level. 
  
We currently have 2 Grade One students receiving Stand Alone ENL instruction for 180 minutes per week, 6 receiving 
Integrated Instruction for 180 minutes per week, and 12 receiving Integrated Instruction for 90 minutes per week.  Of the 18 
children; 1 is at the Entering Level, 1 is at the Emerging Level, 1 is at the Transitioning Level, 3 are at the Expanding Level, and 
12 are at the Commanding Level. 
 
We currently have 4 Grade Two students receiving Stand Alone ENL instruction for 180 minutes per week, 7 receiving 180 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

minutes of Integrated Instruction, 15 receiving 90 minutes of Integrated Instruction. Of those 22 children, 0 are at the Entering 
Level, 4 are at the Emerging Level, 1 is at the Transitioning Level, 2 are at the Expanding Level, and 15 are at the Commanding 
Level. 
 
We currently have 4 Grade Three students receiving Stand Alone ENL instruction for 180 minutes per week, 8 receiving 180 
minutes of Integrated Instruction, and 12 receiving 90 minutes of Integrated Instruction.  Of the 20 children, 4 are at the 
Entering Level, 0 are at the Emerging Level, 1 is at the Transitioning Level, 3 are at the Expanding Level, and 12 are at the 
Commanding Level.  
 
We currently have 1 Grade Four student receiving Stand Alone ENL instruction for 180 minutes per week, 2 receiving 180 
minutes of Integrated Instruction per week, and 5 receiving 90 minutes of Integrated Instruction. Of the 7 ELLs, 1 is at the 
Entering Level, 0 are at the Emerging Level, 0 are at the Transitioning Level, 1 is at the Expanding Level, and 5 are at the 
Commanding Level. 
 
We currently have 3 Grade Five students receiving 180 minutes of Stand Alone ENL instruction for 180 minutes per week, 8 
receiving 180 minutes of Integrated Instruction per week, and 5 receiving 90 minutes of Integrated Instruction per week. Of 
the 13 ELLs, 0 are at the Entering Level, 3 are at the Emerging Level, 1 is at the Transitioning Level, 4 are at the Expanding 
Level, and 5 are at the Commanding Level.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  At P.S. 196Q, the students are learning English through a Freestanding ENL model of ENL instruction.  We do not currently 
have either a Bilingual or Dual Language Program.   
 
In our Freestanding ENL model, the ENL teacher plans closely with the classroom teachers in order to provide scaffolding so 
that the students can have an opportunity to incorporate the information into their personal knowledge.  The teachers 
scaffold rigorous Common Core instruction for ENL students, so that they can achieve the standards.  When the ENL teacher 
integrates into a classroom, the teachers teach side by side using methodologies proven to enhance learning for ELLs.  Some of 
these methodologies include modeling, diagrams and pictures, physical responses (by students and by teachers), choral 
repetition, as well as pre reading activities to strengthen vocabulary. Depending on the students’ level of English language 
proficiency, they may need to use bilingual dictionaries, picture dictionaries, or Google Translate.  The students can then work 
with the information at a higher level of understanding. The teachers work together providing the students with copies of 
passages in the textbook, then break into small groups to delve and closely inspect for language learning as well as for content. 
The teachers have a variety of materials available to them including, but not limited to computers, leap pads, iPads, BrainPop, 
SMART Board, textbooks, trade books in the classroom libraries, and content area libraries in the ENL classroom and in the 
school library. Books on tape are available to enhance the students’ reading and listening skills.  
 
        The workshop model is used as a frame for most lessons at PS 196Q. The following methods of instruction are followed in 
all classrooms: 
•              Guided reading of additional language appropriate texts to develop background knowledge. 
•              Explicit vocabulary instruction on key words and concepts. 
•              Additional practice of foundational concepts. 
•              Use of visuals to aid comprehension.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   We do not currently have Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual language programs at P.S. 196Q.  However, we do have a 
variety of second language trade books available for our ELLs.  When our ELL students are required to take the NYS Math and 
Science exams, they are given the opportunity to take the exams in their native language.  They may be given a copy of the 
exam in their native language alongside an English version or they are provided with glossaries.  This year, Spring 2017, one of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

our children took her math and science exams in Spanish.  Several other students used native language exams side-by-side, but 
completed their exams in English.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
5a) Presently, we do not have any students who fall into the category of Students with Interrupted Formal Education 
(SIFE).  However, we are prepared for any new entrant who may fall into this category.  We would assess their reading level 
and build on their current academic skills. 
 
5b) P.S. 196's plan for newcomers provides for a positive classroom environment.  The warm and welcoming atmosphere we 
create allows for more rapid language development and interaction into our academic setting. We help newcomers adjust to 
the new school experience more easily by: familiarizing them with lunchtime, arrival/dismissal routines; by labeling classroom 
objects, thereby teaching basic vocabulary; including ELLs when assigning classroom jobs (taking into account their level of 
proficiency); focusing on the positive, by creating frequent opportunities for success in the classroom; using gestures as often 
as possible and making sure the student knows what the gestures mean.  In addition, we facilitate the acquisition of the 
rhythm and sounds of English, by having the newcomer listen to and repeat songs and chants.  It is our goal to include 
newcomers in all instructional activities that take place in the classroom.  ELLs are additionally provided with a variety of 
intervention services, including in-classroom additional instruction, Extended Day tutoring, after school AIS and ENL instruction 
as budget allows.  These students may be exempt from the state test depending on the length of time they have been in an 
English language school system.  As ELLs, they are entitled to receive test accommodations on all tests throughout the school 
year, including standardized state tests. They receive time and a half to complete their tests.   Furthermore, our ENL teachers 
have worked on compiling a valuable newcomer packet containing “go-to” resources for these students.  They distribute these 
useful packets to classroom teachers who have newcomers in their class.   
 
5c)  Our plan for differentiating instruction for ELLs receiving service four to six years is to provide more opportunities for 
written and oral responses to literature and in the content areas.  This subgroup will continue to be provided with Academic 
Intervention Services (AIS) as the budget allows and have their instruction differentiated based on on-going assessments.  The 
students, depending on their grade, will be taught using either the Wilson Program for reading or the Fundations program for 
phonics and reading.  Additionally, these students will have access to Reading A-Z, Pebble Go, and Reading Eggs.  These are 
leveled literature programs capable of reading text aloud to our ELLs.  This will help the students practice their listening skills 
while enhancing their comprehension.  Furthermore, teachers may use the animated educational site BrainPop to enhance 
students’ comprehension.  Some of these students may have IEP's or need smaller classes.  More support for these students 
will be provided from their self contained classroom teacher and the SETSS teacher, as per their IEP's.  The ENL teachers will 
work with the students as per their mandated minutes per week, based upon their Spring 2017 NYSESLAT scores. 
 
5d) We have no long-term ENL students.  However, we are prepared for any new entrant who may fall into this category.  
 
5e) Long term ELLs and former ELLs are invited to participate in after school programs, such as AIS, ENL Club, as well as 
summer programs.  They may be placed in an At Risk pull-out group with the SETSS teacher if the ENL teachers, the classroom 
teacher, and parent/guardians agree that the student would benefit from this.  Some students may be placed in an ICT class on 
the general education side if they are not eligible for special education services so that they will benefit from having two 
providers in their classroom at all times. We also incorporate lessons on building academic language in their regular classroom 
and the ENL classroom. The students who have scored at the Commanding level on the 2016 or 2017 NYSESLAT receive 
support from The ENL Teacher of 90 minutes of Integrated service in either ELA or content area studies per week as per CR 
Part 154.2 for two school years.  Additionally, all of the ELLs will receive test accommodations of time and a half. The students 
who scored at the Commanding level will continue to receive the same testing modifications for two school years. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 
Social Studies, Math and Science classroom texts as well as ELA materials are used to preview vocabulary and concepts. In 
addition, Read Aloud texts and leveled books are used as a source for building academic language.  Both ENL and General Ed 
co-teachers plan together to ensure that language objectives are incorporated into the units of study.  Students use a variety 
of materials, including visual, auditory and tactile (manipulatives, etc.). 
Currently we have 3 Self Contained Special Education classes.  The Self Contained Special Education classes are as follows:  K-1, 
2-3, 4-5. Additionally, we have 1 ICT class in Grades 2, 3, 4, and 5 and 2 ICT classes in Grades K and 1.   
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ESL planning and scheduling is a cooperative effort between the ESL and classroom teachers, designed to ensure that ELL 
students receive grade appropriate content and materials with additional support in order to attain English Language 
Proficiency. ELL students in self contained classes have flexible programming and may attend general education classes in 
areas where they demonstrate academic strength and ability. ELL - SWD are placed into ICT classes when 
the student demonstrates academic delays that are unrelated to their multilingualism. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All ELL students at each level of proficiency are provided with targeted instruction in the content areas during our Extended 
Day morning program.  We have teachers who have been specifically trained to work with students using the Wilson 
Program.  All classrooms have leveled libraries with books at appropriate reading levels for every student.  In Grades K-3, we 
have instituted a program for struggling readers called the Leveled Literacy Intervention Program.  Some students in Grades K-
2 are having intervention by working with the Fundations program.   
The ENL teachers deliver small group instruction during Academic Intervention periods to students who require additional 
supports in the different curricular areas, including Social Studies.  Depending on the grade level, Social Studies themes may be 
confusing to ELLs during a variety of lessons that they encounter. For example, it is conceivable that a reading passage or a 
piece of literature may reference a social issue. This social issues may be common knowledge to most classmates (because 
they are based on cultural norms), but may be foreign to the ELL student.  Another example is the traditions and 
understanding of holidays that are American holidays.   
We have a Math intervention specialist who pulls small groups to work on math skills as per student needs.  Our Science 
program is also supplemented by a Science Intervention Specialist who works with small groups of students during the regular 
school day in Grade 4.  Furthermore, we have a STEM Specialist who is able to assist teachers of all grades in creating a hands-
on learning approach, ultimately enhancing learning for all students, including our ELLs.  Students in all grades receive small 
group instruction within the classroom setting after consultation with the ENL teacher to determine appropriate and most 
effective methodologies for individual student needs.  
 
INFORMATION BELOW WILL BE UPDATED IN SEPTEMBER: 
 
Our data indicates that our students are benefitting from the scaffolding that we provide for them.  Last year our third grade 
ELLs were tested on the ELA and Math state tests.  We are able to use this data to know where they will need further 
support.  One child scored a 1 on the ELA, four children scored a 2 on the ELA, and one child scored a 3 on the ELA.  As they sit 
in grade four we note that 3 of them were exempt from the ELA test last year because they were here in an English Language 
School System for such a short time (less than one year.)  Two children scored a 2 on the math test, four children scored a 3 on 
the state math test, and two children scored a 4 on the state math test. Last year our fourth grade students were tested on the 
ELA, MATH, and SCIENCE state tests. Three children scored a 1 on the ELA, four scored a 2 on the ELA and, one scored a 3 on 
the ELA. As they sit in grade five, we note that 1 of them was exempt from the ELA because she was here in an English

Language School System for such a short time (less than one year.) We will also note that 2 children's parents opted them out 
of the testing process last year when they were in 4  th   grade.  Five children scored a 2 on the NYS Math exam, three scored a 
3, and  one scored a 4.  These same children took the state science test and six of them scored a 3 on it, while three of them 
scored a 4.  Last year our fifth grade ELLs were tested on the ELA state test and the Math state test. We had only two ELLs in 
grade five last year. One child was exempt from taking the ELA because he was here for so short a time (less that a year.) The 
other ELL scored a 2 on the ELA.  They also took the state Math test.  One child scored a 3 while the other scored a 4 on the 
NYS math test. We expect our ELLs to continue to flourish with the continued support in place for them. Currently, all 
instruction is in English because this school only has a Freestanding ESL program.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In the 2016-2017 academic school year, teachers on all grades, including our ENL teachers, were trained to use Google 
Classroom.  Google Classroom will be implemented throughout the school community.  It will link our parents into the 
classroom seamlessly.  A positive feature of this program is that it incorporates student work that can be assigned to be 
completed at home.  This will afford the students time to do the assignments and allow them to use home resources to 
accomplish their work.  For example, they can spend time with parents, use electronic dictionaries, or do computer research in 
their home language. 
The RAPL report, HLIS report, and the blue cards all work to inform the school of the parents preferred language of 
communication. Many ELL students’ parents have indicated a preference for English as their language of 
communication.  However, Google Classroom has information available in other languages and the ability to translate.  We will 
be aligning our resources and schedules to facilitate Integrated ENL for all grades.  We will be working with any teachers who 
have TESOL extensions to meet the needs of ENL students, especially the Commanding ELLs who require 90 minutes of ENL 
instruction per week.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have never had a Bilingual Program at P.S. 196Q.  However, we maintain ongoing tallies of Bilingual Program parent 
requests toward opening a program if appropriate.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELLs have equal access to all school programs and services at P.S. 196.  All students at P.S. 196, including our ENL students, can 
receive a variety of supplemental services.  These services include Speech, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, 
Counseling, and Resource Room.  ELLs are welcome to participate in all after school activities.  Some of these activities include 
chorus, art talent, theater arts, and more.  There are also test preparation classes that are offered after school and during our 
Saturday academies.  ENL students participate in these classes equally with their English proficient peers.  An invitation letter is 
sent home to all students in all classes grade wide when an after school program/class opens.   
At P.S. 196, we currently only have the Freestanding ENL program.  Therefore, our ENL students are sitting in monolingual 
classrooms and receive all the same notifications as their monolingual peers. 
 
 INFORMATION WILL BE UPDATED IN SEPTEMBER: 
 This year our AIS program serves 59 students after school. 17% of those students are ELLs. This program is designed to support 
students toward skill building in the areas of English Language Arts and Math. Students participating in the Chorus, Art Talent, 
and Theater Arts Programs try out for their spots in the program.  Each program has a specific criteria for participation. This 
year our Chorus has 95 children and our ENL students make up10% of them. Our Art Talent Program has 19 participants and 
16% are ELLs. The Theater Arts program doesn't begin until the spring.  Students will be invited by grade to try out for parts in 
the production. We have always  had ELLs participate in the production in prior years, and we will have ELL students 
participating this spring again.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELL students at P.S. 196 have a variety of grade-appropriate, rigorous, Common-Core-aligned instructional materials available 
to them within their classroom and in the ENL room.  Some of these resources include written material across all curricular 
areas, large books, and books on tape.  ELL students also have access to a broad range of technology, including laptops, Leap 
Frog pads, iPads and SMARTboards.  Our school uses web-based software programs called BrainPop, IXL, Reading A-Z, Pebble 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

Go, and Reading Eggs to help support ELL learning. These programs all have bilingual features. 
This year, our ENL Teachers were trained using Google Classroom.  They have acquired the necessary knowledge to further 
support their ELLs in their language learning process.  For example, they will download the necessary “Add-On” so that the 
ELLs can have their assignments read aloud to them.  This will further enhance the ELLs’ listening and reading skills.  Another 
“Add-On” that will be utilized will allow newcomers to write in their native language and then translate the document.  This 
will ensure that all learners can participate within their academic setting.  
 The Classroom, Science, Art, Music, and Technology teachers all have computer access and use Google Translate when 
necessary to effectively communicate content area concepts to ELL students. The classroom programs for ELA (Ready Gen) and 
Math (Go Math) provide lesson planning instruction suggestions specifically for ENL students. Our ELL-SWD population uses 
the same materials as their grade level schoolmates. However, their assignments may be modified as per their IEP to 
accommodate their learning needs.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Our ELLs participate in a Stand Alone and Integrated program designed with their home language taken into consideration.  For 
example, Entering and Emerging students who speak the same language are paired during group or partnership work during 
lessons.  Whenever possible, parents are provided with translated versions of all materials that are distributed.  Additionally, 
there is home language support provided to students in the classrooms via bilingual literature in the classroom libraries and/or 
in the school library.  The ENL classroom has bilingual books, educational “game” materials, visual support, and bilingual 
dictionaries.  We currently have several bilingual paraprofessionals on staff and several bilingual classroom teachers.  Any of 
these personnel can be called upon to assist our ELLs.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services support and resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels. Registering students are placed in classes 
based upon their birthdates and grade levels as per birth certificates and/or official documents from their prior school.  All 
students are seated in age appropriate classes regardless of their English language proficiency.   
Within 10 days after registration, students may be tested using the NYSITELL as determined by their HLIS and HLIS interview, 
possibly by any submitted school materials from their previous school, and/or an informal in house assessment.  Once the 
determination is made to administer the NYSITELL, we administer and determine ELL status. If the student is determined to be 
an ELL, a Parent Orientation meeting occurs and then a Program Selection Form is collected.  At this point, we place the child in 
the parents’ preferred program if it is available.  Currently, we only have the Freestanding ENL Program at P.S. 196.   Therefore, 
all students are placed in monolingual (English) classes and are provided the number of minutes of English language instruction 
as per their English Language Proficiency Level.   
ENL students at P.S. 196 are in classes with students of their same age.  If it is determined that a student has a disability that 
requires they be participants in a program designed to support their learning, they will still be with students of their own age 
group.  This is unless the IEP team determines otherwise and includes this in their IEP. Our building has one ICT class for Grades 
2, 3, 4, and 5 and two ICT classes for Grades K and 1.  We additionally have 3 Special Education Self Contained classes for 
Grades K-1, 2-3, and 4-5.  Some of our ELL students with IEPs participate in support services as per their IEP's such as 
Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Hearing, or Speech and Language Services.  These are all scheduled with students that 
are on their grade or within one year of their grade. The specialists for these programs can then modify classroom materials 
and provide age/grade level materials and structure their lessons to focus on activities that will support the students 
and strengthen their skills as needed.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school is not currently sharing a building.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In the spring, parents of newly enrolled Kindergarten students are formally introduced to all key school personnel. They are 
met individually by our ENL Teachers as part of their registration process. Our newest students also have the opportunity to 
visit Kindergarten classes. Thus, before school begins, parents and students have had a warm and informative introduction to 
our school.  Additionally, once an incoming student is determined to be eligible for the NYSITELL, they are invited to be tested 
in June or July by appointment.  Students who come during the school year are provided a tour of the building by the pupil 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

personnel secretary, the parent coordinator, or an administrator.  All students are made to feel welcome and supported from 
the first time they step into our building.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  
We currently do not have language electives.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We currently do not have dual language programs.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development has been, and will be, ongoing for all teachers and staff at PS 196.  Teachers, Psychologists, 
Occupational Therapists, Speech and Language therapists, Guidance Counselors, Special Education Teachers,  Parent 
Coordinator, Paraprofessionals, and ESL Teachers and coordinators will continue to learn and hone their skills regarding 
integrating ESL strategies into their classrooms, sessions and meetings.  We have Professional Learning as a Staff every 
Monday from 7:55-8:50am, and Tuesdays from 8:00-8:25. There are a variety of Professional Development opportunities to 
support teachers of ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards. There are Professional Development 
planning periods during which the ENL teachers and the classroom teachers meet and plan in order to maximize English 
language acquisition for the ELLs.  Communication also occurs during grade conferences and lunch meetings.  There will be 
Professional Development provided by the BFSC that can be turn keyed for the staff as well. This ensures that content area 
instruction is aligned with each classroom and that ENL methodologies and strategies are infused into content area instruction. 
The aim of the program is to increase English language proficiency, develop academic language, and content area 
knowledge.  There is concentration and scaffolding revolving around the four language modalities: Listening, Speaking, 
Reading, and Writing.  All staff is considered to be "ELL Personnel" at P.S. 196.  The only ELL program is the 
Freestanding ENL Program. Therefore, our ELLs are part of every class and all our educators are teachers of ELLs.  
The ENL teachers and classroom teachers will attend Professional Development sessions designed to provide support in 
meeting the Common Core learning standards for ELLs throughout the school year, as offered by the DOE and the BFSC.   They 
will also receive professional development through webinars, intervisitations with other schools, and any other methods 
offered to schools. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
At P.S. 196 all general education and special education, as well as related service providers ( in particular, speech therapists) 
will receive a minimum of 15% of all PD hours for ENL training.  At least 50% of total professional learning hours for our ENL 
teacher, will be specifically on ENL topics.  This high-quality professional development will be of sufficient intensity and 
duration to have a positive and lasting impact on the teachers’ performance in classrooms.  Attendance sheets are collected 
for each Professional Development session and teachers are responsible for updating their individual professional learning logs 
which are kept in the Principal’s office.             

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 

 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teachers will use the Parent Communication period on Wednesday mornings to meet with and reach out to parents. 
The ENL teachers will coordinate specific times for individual parent/guardian meetings to discuss the development of their 
child's language needs.  Each meeting will be scheduled at the parents' convenience and the school will utilize the DOE 
translation services, any bilingual staff, or other accommodations as necessary.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
We take great pride in being a collaborative learning community providing parents with workshops to keep them informed of 
important topics concerning their children, and the learning environment in our school.  Our principal holds monthly meetings, 
“Coffee and Conversation” which give parents a forum to discuss their concerns and hear about the new initiatives and 
programs taking place in our school. Our school has a blog (ps196q.edublogs.org) that provides parents with a great deal of 
information about the school and available resources.  There is a "pick your language" drop-down menu, that allows 
parents/guardians to choose from among 80+ languages. 
Our parents are encouraged to attend and participate in many of our activities. Some of these activities include  International 
Night, Literacy Celebrations, School Plays, Musical and Drama Performances, Cake Sales and more. Students visit the local 
library to get their New York City public library cards allowing them to visit the public library with their parents. 
We invite our parents to work together to educate our students on cultural matters such as the Lunar New Year. Students 
learn about traditional Asian dances, folklore and costuming and parents join in the culminating celebrations and 
presentations. This is a great way to involve our ELL parents. The ELL and non ELL Asian students are encouraged and excited 
to share information about their native culture during the year.  
We also reach out specifically to our ELL parents to make sure they feel included in the P.S. 196 community. Our ENL teachers 
and Parent Coordinator are in contact with our ELL families to ensure that they receive necessary translation services. The 
school provides free language translation services offered by the DOE on parent-teacher conference days.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Susan Migliano, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When a parent registers their child at PS196Q, the Home Language Identification Survey and Interview serve as a 
guide toward determining what each individual student and family will need regarding language interpretation 
and/or oral interpretation. This is to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information 
in a language they can understand. When each student is registered, a parent or guardian must complete a "blue 
card." This is a card that has contact information in the event that a parent or guardian must be contacted. There 
is a space on the blue card for the parents to indicate their preferred language of communication ie: written (US 
mail or email) or verbal communication. This card is updated yearly. In addition, we use the RSEC report in order 
to access ethnic data, and the RAPL to easily access the information of language preference for both written and 
spoken language communication. The RCPL gives us specific numbers and percentages of specific language needs

child. The results of this survey will drive our decisions regarding Title lll programming. Additionally, our security 
agent is also made aware of potential parental translation needs and uses the NYC DOE issued Language 
Identification Guide to identify language interpretation needs and refers to the language poster displayed in our 
lobby.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In order to reach parents who prefer a language other than English in the event of a school emergency, P.S. 196Q uses 
a phone messenger service called School Messenger. In addition, our bilingual school personnel is provided with a 
phone script in order to contact our limited-English-proficient families. If there is not enough staff who speak the 
parents' home languages, we will utilize the "Over-the-Phone Interpretation Service".  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We have two ENL teachers who are our Language Access Coordinators (LAC). They will turnkey information provided 
at meetings to all staff members during school wide professional development sessions. This will ensure that all staff 
members will be aware of the goals of the Chancellor's Regulation A-663 and are compliant. An attendance sheet will 
be collected at each training session. They will be reviewed and stored by the LAC to ensure that all personnel 
receives training in order to properly follow the procedures. 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any:

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

P.S. 196Q sends English and translated copies of the Parent’s Bill of Rights and Responsibilities to parents whose 
primary language is a covered language. It includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. 
Information regarding translation and interpretation services, as well as the Multilingual Welcome Poster, are posted 
in the entrance area of our building. This information is also available on our website and has been sent home to 
parents. The Parent Guide to Language Access and "I Speak..." Card are also available at all parent engagement 
events.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will receive information from parents about the availability and quality of services through a variety of 
mechanisms, including the Learning Environment Survey, the ENL Program Survey, feedback forms from all workshops 
and feedback from Parents Association meetings. Parents are invited one morning per month to join Mrs. Migliano for 
“Coffee and Conversation.” This is scheduled early in the morning before school hours so that working parents can 
attend. They are invited to come and share ideas, suggestions, and concerns in a comfortable relaxed atmosphere. 
This is an excellent opportunity for the administration to hear from our parents and to gather helpful feedback.
