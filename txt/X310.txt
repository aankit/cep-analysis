Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The P.S. 310 mission statement is based on its belief that all children can and will learn. We value each student, 
parent, staff member, business and community member and are respectful of each other's differences and build on 
each other's strengths. The school is committed to the belief that the learning and growth of each individual child will 
be the focus of all activities within the school community. P.S. 310 in partnership with parents, students and staff, in 
respecting the needs of each individual student, will: 

  Provide a safe, nurturing, and child-centered environment, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

  Expect students to achieve high academic standards through a challenging integrated Common Core aligned 

curriculum, 

  Recognize that the home/school connection is vital to the success of our children, and 
  Be dedicated to the development of our children as productive and thoughtful learners who will become 

responsible, literate members of a global society.  

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 310 is located in the northwest section of the Bronx in District 10. Our school population is 85% Hispanic, 9% 
Black, 3% White and 3% other. The school has an enrollment of 746 students in grades Pre-K-5. Our school is divided 
into the following four mini-schools: 

  Early Childhood Center (E.C.C.) is committed to providing a child-centered, early start program for Pre-

Kindergarten and Kindergarten students that will develop students’ social/emotional, academic and physical 
skills. Through an integrated curriculum rooted in language development, students will develop readiness 
skills to become confident learners. Students will be engaged in experiential and hands-on activities that 
promote thinking and build independence and students’ love of learning. 

  Achieving Reading Together Through the Arts (A.R.T.) promotes the theme of language and literacy through 
the arts and sciences. Through an integrated curriculum rooted in literature, students develop the ability to 
become creative learners and critical thinkers. By connecting literature with the arts, math and science, 
students learn the skills of reading and writing and use them to develop the life-long process of 
communication. 
Science and Literacy Academy (S.L.A.) promotes science inquiry where students can initiate short meaningful 
projects or long term inquiry of the world around them. The science curriculum is integrated with our literacy 
program in which students develop literacy through a holistic approach. The link with hands-on science 
inquiry, cooperative learning groups and technology helps to develop critical thinking and problem solving 
skills. 

 

  Math and Literacy Together (M.A.L.T.) is committed to providing a child-centered reading, writing and 
mathematics program that supports problem solving and critical thinking skills. In the MALT Academy 
teachers provide mathematical instruction that utilizes hands-on instructional strategies and activities that 
promote thinking and reasoning. Students enjoy mathematics as they build confidence and develop better 
understanding of mathematical ideas and concepts. 

We have a strong commitment to providing our students opportunities to engage in varied arts activities during and 
after school. To support us in the area of arts, we have cultivated the following long term collaborations: 

  NYC Children's Theatre - Students create books aligned with our literacy curriculum 
  Theatre Works - Theatre productions of classic stories 
  Midori and Friends - After school violin  
  Ballet Tech - Selected students participate in ballet instruction 

In addition, we have also collaborated with the following organizations for professional development for our staff: 

Liberty Science Center 

 
  New Teacher Center (NTC) 

We continue to try to motivate our school community by providing supplemental activities to further our school 
mission. The following are other special initiatives that we have implemented: 

  Monthly varied parent workshops 
  Academic/Saturday and after school programs 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10

  Pre-K Kindermusik (Home/School Music Program) 
 
  Read-a-thon (School Wide Reading Incentive Initiative) 
  Computer Math & Reading Programs, for school and home use (ST Math, iReady, myON, News-O-Matic) 

At P.S. 310 we are proud of the systems that we have developed in the areas of teacher collaboration and 
professional development. We have provided teachers with four opportunities a week to meet within their grade or 
across grades to work on curriculum. As a community of learners, we continue to seek to improve our instructional 
practices and resources through our collaborative culture. During each unit of study, we are engaged in reflective 
practices to refine our work. This year we continue to promote shared leadership during professional development 
and the continued development of inquiry teams. Our yearly professional development plan helps us to ensure that 
we have aligned our professional development to further address recommendations outlined during our 
Superintendent's Review. We are also proud of our comprehensive teacher feedback system, which includes frequent 
observations and learning walks that allow teachers to receive individualized timely actionable feedback, using the 
Framework for Teaching. Our Respect for All Initiative has ensured that we have an aligned vision on how to meet the 
social/emotional needs of our students so that they can be academically/socially successful. In addition, we have a 
robust family engagement plan which includes a menu of workshops every month, Literacy Exposition and Family 
Night.  

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 15.4% of our students are English as a New Language (ENL) and 14.4% have Special Needs. Our ENL 
students continue to need support with all four modalities of communication: listening, speaking, reading and writing. 
Approximately, 22% are at the Entering and Emerging level of proficiency and 78% are at the Transitioning, Expanding 
and Commanding levels. We have seen progress in listening and speaking, but need to continue to work on reading 
and writing with these students. Our special needs students continue to need support with reading and writing and 
internalizing academic behaviors, such as perseverance and organizing for success. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

For the 2017-18 academic year, we have worked diligently to increase rigor in our instructional practices schoolwide, 
with a focus problem solving. Students were encouraged to participate in evaluative practices and persevere in the 
learning process with emphasis on mathematics and science. Teachers worked to support students to take ownership 
for their learning and to utilize problem solving steps throughout the curriculum. In addition, in our classrooms, we 
have seen an increase in students reading complex non-fiction texts, as well as an increase in students responding 
daily to literature. Our 2017-18 state data results reflect improvement in both reading and math, as we had a 6% 
increase in student achieving grade level performance on the New York State ELA test and a 5% increase in the New 
York State math test last year. 

In an effort to increase rigor in our instruction last year we demonstrated improvement in strengthening the 
progression of complexity from grade to grade in specific standards of concern. We have worked to ensure that units 
build from grade to grade and have worked to eliminate redundancies in the curriculum. We have strategically culled 
from Teachers College units of study to support our literacy work. Our work on vocabulary development has improved 
but continues to require further attention. We need to ensure that students are provided with multiple strategies to 
increase word attack skills. This year to expand this work, we will Identifying a set of high utility vocabulary words for 
each grade for study. ( Advanced Literacy Hallmark 4) Overall, we want to have a balance between scaffolds and 
productive struggle for our students to ensure that we are encouraging them to grapple with challenging work.  

For the 2018-19 school year, we will continue to have academic rigor as an area of focus. We will focus on ensuring 
that we increase the rigor within our curriculum by continuing to develop cross curricular learning opportunities that 
challenge students. We want to continue to engage students in problem solving throughout the day. Part of this will 
include building student independence in learning by encouraging self-reflective practice and by expanding the use of

rubrics for peer and self-assessment. Also, our data reflected that students continue to struggle with writing. Thus we 
will focus on Advanced Literacy Hallmark 3 :To use extended writing as a platform to build language and knowledge. 
In addition, we will continue to our work from last year on increasing student discussion using various researched-
based approaches, such as sentence stems, the Frey Fisher Model, and other discussion techniques . (Advanced 
Literacy Hallmark 2). 

Lastly, we will continue to work on the element of effective school leadership development with a focus on increasing 
teacher performances on the instructional components 3B and 3D. Teachers will work closely with Administrators on 
analyzing student work and data in order to group students strategically and impact student outcomes. Also, Assistant 
Principals will develop differentiated professional development plans to address the areas of concern for teachers 
during academy school meetings.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on our Superintendent’s feedback during her visit, we will continue working on ensuring that we increase the 
rigor within our curriculum by continuing to develop multidisciplinary learning opportunities that challenge students 
to think more critically. Part of this will include building student independence in learning by encouraging self-
reflective practice and by expanding the use of rubrics for peer and self-assessment in all content areas. Teachers will 
support students by conducting timely conferences to provide actionable feedback, as well as providing immediate 
feedback during daily lessons. In addition, we have assessed that we will need to continue to work on increasing 
student engagement in text-based discussions, using various researched-based approaches, such as the Frey Fisher 
Model, Reciprocal Teaching and Socratic Seminars. We also need to ensure that we continue to increase rigor in our 
instruction and allow students to engage in productive struggle when learning. 

A review of TCRWP Assessments reflected a 19% increase in students meeting grade level benchmarks when 
measured to students' performance at the beginning of the year. This was a similar growth to the previous year. 
Overall 56% of our students were able to reach grade level benchmark. This was an 8% increase from 2016-17 year. A 
review of our data reflects that vocabulary continues to be a concern as it hinders students who are close to 
benchmark from comprehending text at a deeper level and increasing in performance. Thus, this year we will focus on 
(Advanced Literacy Hallmark 4) identifying and studying a set of high utility vocabulary words for each grade. In 
addition, there is a need to continue to ensure consistency in vocabulary instruction throughout the year with a focus 
on providing multiple strategies that support word attack skills. We look to provide opportunities to infuse vocabulary 
development throughout the day. All lessons will need to reflect consideration for increasing word knowledge and 
expanding opportunities for unpacking and learning high utility vocabulary words.  

Moving forward, to help students close the achievement gap, we need to strengthen foundational skills in K-2 and 
continue to focus on critical reading behaviors and strategies. An analysis of K-2 data reflects a high percentage of 
students in first and second grade are far below grade. In addition, when K-2 data was disaggregated from Grades 3-5, 
we saw that the upper grades outperformed the lower grades by 13%. In grades 3-5, 62% reached benchmark, as 
compared to 49% in grades K-2. A possible theory of action is that we need to continue to further work on 
foundational skills in first and second grade with a targeted instructional plan using diagnostic data regularly for under 
performing students to inform small group reading instruction.  

Last year we saw a 6% increase in student performance in the New York State ELA. An initial review of the item 
analyses for the English Language Arts State Test 2017-2018 indicated the following strengths and weaknesses: 

Strengths 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

 

 

 

 

In the third and fourth grades, determining the maid idea of informal reading was a strength. (Reading 
Informational 3.2, 4.2) 

In the fifth grade, understanding point of view for informational text was a strength. (Reading Informational 
5.6) 

In the fourth and fifth grades, understanding the structure of information text was a strength. Although, this 
had been a weakness in the previous year. 
In the third and fourth grades, understanding word meaning in literature was a strength, but a weakness in 
fifth grade. 

Areas for Improvement 

  There continues to be a need to support students in all grades to improve writing in both informational and 

literary sources. 

  Another area of weakness in fourth and fifth grades is Literary Point of View, Literary Themes and Comparing 

Literary Elements. (R.I. 3.2, R.I. 3.3, R.I. 3.8, R.L. 4.6, R.L. 4.4, R.I. 4.2, R.L. 5.2, R.I. 5.3) 

 
 

In third grade, Informational Writing from sources was an overall weakness. (R.I. 3.2, R.I. 3.3, R.I. 3.8) 
In fifth grade, understanding word meaning (R.L. 5.2) was a weakess. 

In addition, based on our school survey, we will continue to work on demonstrating improvement in the components 
of School Leadership by increasing opportunities for school wide reflection, communication and teacher leadership. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all teachers will provide rigorous instruction with a focus on advanced literacy skills to foster student 
independence in learning, using assessment tools in preparation for Next Generation Standards. This will be measured 
by a 20-25% increase in TCRWP.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

This year, we will continue the implementation of Advanced 
Literacy skills in preparation for integration of Next Generation 
standards. In addition we will continue to focus on school wide 
problem solving to increase rigor in our instruction which will be 
utilized across all content areas and support student 
independence. This process of understanding, planning, trying 
and looking back will further support high quality feedback from 
teachers as well as student self-assessment. 

 

We will seek to increase rigor in our reading program for grades 
2-5 by ensuring that students engage in book clubs. Our intention 
is to increase student engagement by motivating students to 
share reading experiences with peers using classroom structures 
such as, shared reading, and reciprocal reading. By way of 
encouraging text-based discussions, teachers will help students 
develop their critical thinking and analytical skills. In grades 3-5 
we will focus particular attention on protocols to enhance these 
practices. 

 

We will continue to place a focus on the word study throughout 
the curriculum of our literacy block. Our goal is to secure teacher 
expertise in systematic vocabulary instruction with attention to 
the integration of multiple strategies to support word attack 
skills. In addition, we will seek to focus attention on Advanced 
Literacy for Hallmark 4 (identification and study of High Utility 
Vocabulary words to support language development and content 
knowledge). 

 

In writing we will continue to work on building students’ skills 
utilizing student friendly rubrics aligned to the standards. 
Students will be supported during writing conferences to use 
rubrics to set goals. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

 

Additionally, we would also like to continue working on ensuring 
that we increase the rigor within our curriculum, by developing 
multidisciplinary learning opportunities that challenge students 
to think more critically and solve real life problems utilizing 
STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and 
Mathematics) projects. We will seek to embed at least three 
cross-content projects within our curriculum that will give 
students the opportunity to apply our school wide problem 
solving process. We expect these projects to increase rigor, 
student ownership, motivation, and independence. The goal is to 
provide learning experiences that allow students to synthesize 
cross curriculum content learning and to include opportunities 
for art. 

 

Teachers will continue their work during reading conferences to 
provide targeted instruction using the Leveled Literacy 
Intervention Program. This year we will also expand the Reading 
Rescue Program as an early grade Tier 3 intervention

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In the area of Student Social and Emotional Health, we recognize this as an area of strength for our school. The 
implementation of our Respect for All Initiative has helped us to create a positive learning environment for our 
students. We have ensured that our students’ social/emotional, as well as academic needs are met. Monthly 
Instructional Support Team (IST), School Implementation Team (SIT) meetings are designed to focus on individual 
student’s academic and social needs. This year, we will continue to unify our efforts around positive reinforcement 
strategies by the continued use of the Class Dojo application. A review of our schoolwide Respect for All data reflects 
that we surpassed our 80% monthly average goal and this year we will increase our goal to 85%. Our data is generated 
by the calculation of three points per school day ( Students can earn one point for class, one point for lunch and one 
point for prep period.) multiplied by the number of school days per month.  

 

In order to more effectively aggregate school wide data regarding social emotional development of students and to 
increase our parent involvement, we will continue to utilize the class Dojo Application. With this system 
administrators, teachers, students and parents have the ability to access, monitor and communicate school wide 
expectations, we will continue to utilize Class Dojo and Cloud 9 World Program as a systematic approach to promote 
the development of a positive school culture. Class Dojo will continue to be used to track monthly themes in an effort 
to heighten students’ awareness of positive social skills and behaviors as well as specific classroom expectations. We 
recognize students every month based on the monthly themes. This year we will also be recognizing the most 
improved students, as selected by teachers for each class. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all classes will meet or exceed 85% of the monthly point system of our Respect for All Initiative through 
the use of the Class Dojo Application to reinforce positive social skills and monthly themes.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change.

We will continue to build students' social and emotional health 
by utilizing the Cloud 9 World Program to heighten students’ 
awareness on the designated monthly themes. Lessons will be 
taught by our Conflict Resolution Specialist and classroom 
teachers with special attention to the following monthly themes:

  March: Integrity 
  April: Determination 
  May: Cooperation 
 

January: Compassion and Most Improved 
February: Cooperation 

June: Patience and Most Improved 

These themes will be infused in the curriculum and a monthly 
schoolwide text selection will be shared with all classes. 
Throughout the month, students will earn Class Dojo points 
based upon their achievement of monthly themes to further 
promote a positive school culture. Students with the most points 
each month will be chosen as the Student of the Month. 
Administrators, parents, and teachers will celebrate these 
students during a monthly community breakfast. 

 

In addition, our Conflict Resolution Specialist will identify 4th and 
5th grade students to be trained as school mediators. Our goal is 
to ensure that our mediators become leaders and support 
peaceful resolutions to student conflict. Students will solve 
problems utilizing a schoolwide problem solving model which 
includes understand, plan, try, and look back. A log of students’ 
interactions and resolutions will be kept to track data. Also, our 
Conflict Resolution Specialist will notify the staff when to 
acknowledge students for random acts of kindness, three times 
within the year, reflecting behaviors that support monthly

themes. The monthly themes will be displayed on a bulletin 
board on each academy floor. 

 

The school wide implementation of the Class Dojo application 
will be used by all staff members acknowledging the themes, and 
it will be shared with all parents. Training will be provided for all 
teachers in the implementation of the Class Dojo application 
during the month of September. Teachers will launch the 
monthly themes with the use of the Cloud 9 World Program. 

 

The following actionable steps will be implemented: 

  Teachers will include a new character on the Class Dojo 

application that will be used by the specialists to identify 
students that exemplify the characteristics of monthly 
themes. 

  Teachers will continue to utilize Class Dojo as a way to 

monitor student behavior, celebrate student 
achievement, and communicate with parents. 

  Administrators will encourage teachers to utilize Class 

 

Dojo to promote school wide celebrations. 
Implementation of RULER (Recognizing, Understanding, 
Labeling, Expressing and Regulating) tools and strategies 
to support social emotional development. 

  Use of Mood Meter in all classrooms. 

A social emotional support group will be created to provide 
counseling support for at risk students. The following themes will 
be discussed: 

Self-esteem 

 
  Grief Counseling 
Social Awareness 
 
  Health and Wellness 
  Organization/Study Skills 
  Anti-Bullying 

Social emotional support groups and counseling support for at-
risk students will be provided. We will collaborate with the NYC 
Thrive Program for students/families dealing with mental health 
issues. 

 

We will continue to provide a "New Comers" club for new arrivals 
to the country, which promotes students to build positive, 
friendly relationships with peers and adults alike. These students

are able to build a sense of security and transition smoothly into 
a new culture. 

 

Further development of after school clubs such as: 

  Basketball (Boys and Girls) 
  Girls Book Club 
  Music Club ( Midori and Friends) 
  Dance Club 
  Mighty Milers 
  Academic Intervention after school and Saturday 

Programs 

  Keyboard and Guitar Classes 
  Champions Club (STH [Students in Temporary Housing] 

and at-risk students) 

To meet the needs of our subpopulations (ENL Students, 
Students with Disabilities [SWD], and Students in Temporary 
Housing [STH]), we will actively seek to engage these students in 
after school and Saturday activities. Counselors will identify the 
students from varied sub-groups to participate in support groups 
which they will lead (Champions Club). In addition, these 
students will be provided with any basic educational resources 
needed, such as notebooks, book bags, uniforms, and bilingual 
dictionaries. Buddy systems will be established for various sub-
groups to provide peer mentoring. 

To encourage parent participation, a monthly parent calendar 
outlines all upcoming parent activities. During the school year, 
varied parent workshops will be given. One of the topics will be 
on Conflict Resolution and utilizing Class Dojo. In addition, we will 
host a New Comer ENL meeting for parents in order to provide 
orientation regarding our school community and other resources 
available. Lastly, workshops regarding academic topics such as 
"Reading to Your Child at Home", and "At Home Mathematics 
and Science" will be offered. 

As a school community, we continue to focus on setting a 
positive nurturing tone that values Respect for All, which 
cultivates a culture of tolerance. This will be achieved through 
our monthly themes, utilization of Class Dojo, support groups, 
after school clubs, and parent workshops. We will also continue 
to work to ensure that every student feels confident to express 
their needs to one or more adults within our school community.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

A review of our Advance data for 2017-18 indicated that we have seen growth in teacher practices in the areas of 
Questioning and Discussion and Engagement, 10% and 15% respectively. We believe our focus on strengthening our 
Instructional Core has helped to support this growth. This year teachers were engaged in professional development in 
the area of STEM science helping us to increase rigor and support cross curricular connections.  

Based on our Superintendent’s feedback for 2017-2018, we will continue working on building teacher capacity in the 
use of assessments during instruction in all content areas. (Q.R. 2..2) In addition, based on an analysis on the 
Instructional Domain of the Advance Evaluation System, component 3D: Assessment and Instruction reflected 
minimal overall growth. As such we intend to focus on enhancing teachers' knowledge of using assessment strategies 
during the lesson. Part of this work will include supporting teachers in developing a process for providing actionable 
feedback with specific points and evidence for improving work products. In addition, we will look to refine our school 
wide protocols to support speaking, listening, reading and writing (Hallmark 5) in order to build student independence 
in learning. We intend to focus on establishing protocols that encourage students to consistently engage in text based 
discussions and writing opportunities, as well as self-reflective practices. This year we will continue to foster critical 
thinking skills by encouraging students to analyze their work for misconceptions and deepen problem solving skills. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate in six cross-curricular professional development cycles in order to 
increase instructional rigor and prepare for implementation of Next Generation Standards. This will be measured by a 
5% increase in the instructional components Questioning & Discussion (3B) and Assessment (3D) of the Advance 
Evaluation System.

In addition, teachers will collaborate on an inquiry study focused 
on Advanced Literacy, and mini schools will participate in a book 
study of Culturally Responsive Teaching & the Brain. 

 

First and second year teachers will be a part of the New Teacher 
Center Mentoring Program. Instructional coaches and select 
classroom teachers will act as mentors. Mentors will be trained 
by the New Teacher Center throughout the school year on best 
practices for mentoring. Mentors will have time to work with 
new teachers to model lessons, plan lessons, and debrief on 
classroom practices. Additionally, a model teacher will host 
weekly Lab sites focusing on first and second year teachers as 
well as the upper grades. 

ENL teachers will meet bimonthly to review student data, analyze 
student work and create student-friendly rubrics using New 
Language Progressions. In addition, we will continue to 
implement the SIOP training received from the Center for 
Applied Linguistics. Specialty groups continue to meet to review 
curriculum units and offer ideas for differentiation and 
integration. Our Special Education Department will meet to 
review IEPs in order to improve the quality of the present levels 
of performance. Additionally, an articulation time will be worked 
into our Tuesday professional learning time to allow classroom 
teachers to work with ENL and SETSS teachers, to ensure the best 
possible supports are being given to our students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After aggregating school wide Advance data around the measures of teacher practice, it was determined that 
continued work around Questioning, Discussion and Assessment is needed. Specifically, teachers need to continue to 
work on helping students to participate in text-based discussions and to justify their thinking. In addition, we need to 
continue to support teachers to assess during the lesson. Furthermore, more work is needed on using assessment to 
group strategically and determine next steps for students. 

Based on the 2017-2018 Teacher Framework data, there is a need for additional professional development around 
components 3b: Questioning and Discussion and 3d: Using Assessment in Instruction. For example, 54% of our 
teachers are demonstrating effective practice in Questioning and Discussion. Additionally, in component 3d: 
Assessment during instruction, 33% of teachers need additional work around using assessments daily to support 
instruction. In an effort to support the differentiated needs of teachers, facilitation of a collaborative discussion 
around component 4e: Growing and Developing Professionally, there will be an emphasis on student work outcomes 
during post observational conferences. Also, the leadership team will lead triennial school wide reflection sessions as 
a method of obtaining information regarding teacher needs and concerns.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will continue to implement a fully functional observation plan with specific emphasis on 
the impact of teacher feedback in regards to advanced literacy skills and how it promotes student independence. This 
will be measured by a 5-10% increase in components 3B (questioning and discussion) and 3D (Assessment) in the 
Advance Evaluation System.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

An observational calendar was created to maintain a consistent 
system and structure to implement the evaluation of teacher 
practice based on the Teacher Framework. Administrators will 
meet monthly to conduct "snapshots" to calibrate and reflect on 
the measures of teacher practice and student outcomes in order 
to improve the consistency and alignment of our work. In 
addition, an instructional focus calendar was provided, outlining 
CEP goals and monthly focus for walkthroughs which will provide 
non-evaluative feedback to teachers and support administrative 
alignment regarding best practices. This will help us publicly 
identify teacher expertise to further encourage the sharing of 
new ideas and teacher initiative for improving their practice. 
Also, our walkthroughs provide the administrative team a 
structure by which to evaluate the impact of decisions and 
practices and make adjustments as needed. 

 

School Leaders will focus on supporting to improve teacher 
practice schoolwide. To achieve this objective, administrators will 
meet with teachers for the following purposes: 

  Post observation conferences after each observation to 

include student work to assess impact of instruction. 
  To observe lessons with special attention to Advance 

Literacy practices. 

  To support teachers with implementation of best 

practices in assessment with attention to protocols that 
increase student independence. 

  To support implementation of instructional shifts that 

encourage text based discussions. 

  To support school wide efforts to build awareness and 

capacity on Next Generation Standards 

  To utilize Webb’s Depth of Knowledge to evaluate tiered 
differentiated choices and to evaluate student outcomes 
during post observations 

  Goal setting meetings twice a year 
  Data meetings to examine and plan using F&P data 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

  To lead professional development sessions during mini 

school meetings and after school 

  To lead Monday professional development sessions 
  To support Inquiry work related to Culturally Responsive 

Teaching. 

A survey will be used in conjunction with classroom evaluations 
to identify best practices in order to highlight staff members to 
support teachers in taking ownership of their own development. 
In addition, we will seek to identify "grade leaders" that can 
participate in professional development planning meetings to 
support our schoolwide instructional focus in reading for the 
year. Also, after each administration of TCRWP, grade meetings 
will continue to be devoted to teachers' sharing trends and 
strategies for improving student outcomes.  

During goal setting sessions, post observation conferences and 
data meetings, teachers will continue to track ENL and Special 
Needs students to closely monitor their progress and implement 
differentiated strategies to meet the needs of these special 
populations. Additionally, after each informal and formal 
observation, teachers will bring with them work samples from a 
variety of levels in order to discuss student outcomes and 
differentiated choices. In addition, TCRWP data is analyzed for 
both these subgroups to monitor reading progress. 

In order to increase parental involvement we will use our 
Tuesday parent meetings once a month for workshops, led by 
classroom teachers, which will be aligned to our instructional 
focus calendar. Possible topics are as follows: 

Supporting your child with homework 

  Curriculum overview 
 
  Engaging your child in learning during the holidays 
  At home science 
  Motivating your child to reach benchmark 
  Encouraging your child to become a writer/researcher

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

We will continue to work to foster strong family and community ties by communicating high expectations regarding 
family involvement. Every year we continue to grow our parent participation and cultivate strong community 
partnerships that support us in the area of social and emotional developmental health. This year, we feel confident 
that we will be able to deepen the quality and frequency of parent participation by continuing Tuesday afternoon 
sessions. The school will seek to increase reciprocal communication with the families to further support students. 
Tuesday afternoon family involvement time will allow teachers to have more individual conferences with parents 
regarding their child’s progress, as well as provide parent workshops aligned specifically with the goals for the grade. 
Also, there will be monthly workshops addressing grade level needs. 

In addition, this year we seek to focus on increasing parent participation for our ELL students. We will seek to identify 
the parents or guardians of our ELL students in order to increase outreach to those families by letters and phone calls. 
We will have specific meetings to focus on ELL students only. 

 

Lastly, we will continue to hold specific meetings with our families whose children have been chronically 
absent in order to improve student attendance for those students. The goal will be to identify impediments to 
students attending school in order to provide support. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, we will increase involvement of at least 50% of our ELL parents in school workshops and meetings, as 
measured by participation of a minimum of 40% of all monthly workshops, as reflected on attendance logs during the 
2018-19 academic year .

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in 
DOE systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

Presently, we 
have 
approximately 
177 students 
in temporary 
housing. 
Thirteen of 
those 
students are 
in shelters 
and 164 are 
living with 
other 
families. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

Currently, when students register in our school, the Pupil Accounting Secretary informs the Principal if she is 
registering a child in temporary housing. The student is provided with a school start-up package that consists of a 
book bag with everything from notebooks to pencils and crayons. They also receive school T-shirts or sweatshirts, a 
school uniform and a small selection of personal hygiene products. The school counselors are informed about these 
students and outreach is made to those students to ensure that they are provided with transitional support. Students 
are given small group counseling as needed. These students are also invited to participate in our academic 
intervention programs, as well as other enrichment programs offered throughout the year.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
We continue to work diligently to ensure that we have highly qualified staff members by cultivating collaborations 
with local universities in order to have a pool of strong candidates to fill new vacancies. Another source used to find 
qualified candidates is the New York City Teacher Finder. At P.S. 310 we have a robust support process in place for 
new teachers. We begin with a summer orientation that includes new teacher training on: classroom management, 
effective planning, the workshop model, balanced literacy, and school wide expectations prior to the start of the 
school year. At the start of the school year new teachers are assigned a mentor coach and are provided with 
scheduled intervisitations depending on the teacher’s specific needs. Coaches model and provide teachers with 
planning guidance as needed. New teachers have the support of their colleagues during weekly grade level meetings, 
as well as Monday afternoon professional development meetings. 

All teachers have access to support from our School-Based Coaches. Teachers participate weekly in Grade Study 
meetings, Mini School meetings and Monday afternoon professional development meetings to unpack Common Core 
Standards and develop units of study. In addition, they receive the following opportunities for further support: 

  Two mentors involved in training with New Teacher Center 
  New teachers provided mentorship support for 2 years 
  Teachers meet with Administrators and Coaches to review and plan for small groups using data 
  Professional development sessions on Monday afternoon led by coaches 
  Training on methodology for ENLs 
  Teachers to attend selected professional development as needed 
  Consultant from Liberty Science Center provides STEM training 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
P.S. 310 is committed to providing high quality ongoing professional development to all staff members to enable all 
students to meet Common Core Standards. Currently, we have school-based coaches that provide professional 
development activities which are designed to support teachers in the implementation of Common Core Standards. 
Coaches meet with teachers three times a week to focus on curriculum planning and instructional strategies to meet 
the needs of all students. All activities are announced in our monthly professional development calendar. In addition, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

professional development support is provided by way of in-class demonstration lessons, observation and

intervention services, etc.). 
Currently, P.S. 310 has an Early Childhood Center in which Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten classes are housed 
together; thereby, providing a seamless transition for our preschool students entering Kindergarten. Throughout the 
year, parent meetings are held to support literacy development and both Preschool and Kindergarten parents are 
invited. In addition, Preschool and Kindergarten teachers meet together once a week to discuss curriculum matters 
and participate in inquiry work. Also, many school activities such as trips, presentations and performances are 
scheduled to include both Preschool and Kindergarten students. For children coming from other preschools, records 
are forwarded to us so that we may provide any special services needed by incoming Kindergarten students. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
In the end of June, a team of teachers representing each grade met to support the development of writing rubrics. 
Also, teachers are involved in selection and modification of assessment tasks for both reading and math throughout 
the year. In addition, teachers work together during grade study meetings to align tasks to standard-based rubrics and 
review student work together. Teachers are led in these conversations by coaches to ensure that teachers are able to 
use information effectively to inform instruction and establish grade-level alignment. Teachers have been trained on 
using TCRWP system for data entry and accessing reports regarding student progress in reading. In addition, teachers 
will be receiving training on the new School Net assessment tool for monitoring progress in math and reading in 
grades 3-5. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 



Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 310, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

P.S. 310 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; and 

  providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community.

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of ENL students and students with disabilities. The school community 
will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement policy with Title I 
parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school surveys and 
feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and enhance the 
school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA /State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed; and 
conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help.

  holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 
  hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school 

year; 

  encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-

Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

P.S. 310 continues to support our English as a New Language students to develop their literacy 
skills.  A review of the NYSESLAT data for 2017-18 indicates that we have 117 ENL students in 
grades K-5.  Student proficiency levels are as follows: 6% are Entering students, 16% are 
Emerging students, 28% are Transitioning students, 43% are Expanding students and 7% are 
Commanding students.  Our NYSESLAT data indicates students are stronger in the listening and 
speaking modalities and weaker in reading and writing. In the ELA State Test, only 6% of the 
students tested at or above grade level with 66% testing at level 1. In mathematics 7.4% of the 
students tested at grade level.  We need to continue to support our ENL students to develop their 
mathematical problem-solving skills and mathematical writing skills. 
To support our students to meet grade level standards, we will create an after school program for 
our Entering and Emergent students in grades 1-2 using our Title III and Immigrant Funds. 
(Entering and Emergent students in grades 3-5 will be part of our Title I Program.)  A Saturday 
Program will be created for our Transitioning and Expanding students in grades 2, 3, 4 and 5 and 
can also be a part of our Title I After School program. 
The after school program will service 60 ENL students from grades 1 and 2.  The goals of our 
programs will be to strengthen all four language modalities listening, speaking, reading and 
writing.  (ENL teachers will be recruited to teach our program.) 
The structure of the after school program is outlined below:    
· 
Read Aloud-mini lesson (30 minutes)- comprehension storytelling with vocabulary 
developmentMondo Reading Program (Let's Sing About It Oral Language Reading &amp; 
Writing) 
· 
· 
· 
The after school program will begin at December 5. 2018, and will end April 17, 2019.  The 
program will take place twice a week Wednesdays and Thursdays from 2:40-4:40 p.m. 
In addition, Title III funds will be used to continue our Saturday program which will begin at the 
end of January 12, 2019 through April 13, 2019, from 8:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.  The Saturday 
program will focus on increasing students' English proficiency using ENL strategies to build 
students' listening, speaking, reading and writing skills with special attention to preparation for 
the New York State English Language Arts Test.  Students will be involved in listening, 
vocabulary development, guided reading and test preparation work in English.  Sixty (60) ENLs 
in grades 2-5 will be invited to participate. (Bilingual/ENL teachers will support Common 
Branch teachers with planning and small group push-in language development support.) We will 
use the Finish Line Math Program as well as the Finish Line ELA Program.  Also, to increase 
engagement, we will include the technology programs iReady for math and myON for reading. 
 
Students will receive a 2-hour Literacy Block:  

Guided Reading- (30 minutes including independent reading) 
Foundations Program- (30 minutes) 
Homework Help- (30 minutes)

Teachers will use ENL strategies to develop students' mathematics skills by way of focusing on 
accountable talk and writing in this content area.  Math literature and math manipulatives will be 
used to support the further development of all four communication strands and to support 
students with explaining their mathematical thinking. Students will work on verbally explaining 
the process of their mathematical thinking as well as developing mathematics writing about their 
thinking. 
 
Approximately 50 ENLs in grades 3-5 will participate in the Saturday program to be supported 
by two ENL staff members. Teachers involved in the ENL program are Mildred Perez and 
Minerva Ortiz.  After school co-teach planning time will take place during Tuesday, Teacher 
Planning Time.  Co-teaching planning for the Saturday school program will take place during the

Our instructional focus for the 2018-2019 academic year is to increase rigor by providing high-
quality feedback that supports students to engage in problem-solving. Students will be 
encouraged to participate in evaluative practices and to persevere in the learning process in all 
content areas in order to improve their work and understanding.  Based on our study of the book 
Teaching Advanced Literacy Skills: A Guide for Leaders in Linguistically Diverse 
Schools, Nonie K. Lesaux, Emily Phillips Galloway and Sky H. Marietta, we want to continue to 
emphasize the strengthening of our instructional core for our ENL learners.  In addition, our 
emphasis will be on Hallmark 3 (using extended writing as a platform to build knowledge) 
and Hallmark 4 (identifying and studying a set of high utility vocabulary words). 
We will continue to use Advanced Literacy as a school wide focus practice.  In addition, we will 
offer the following Professional Development opportunities during Monday Afternoon:

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The tool used to assess literacy skills is TCRWP Assessment which indicates student Fountas and Pinnell (F&P) reading levels 
based on grade level benchmarks.  The June 2018 F&P data for ENL students indicates the following:

Based on on our F & P data from September 2017 to June 2018 school year,  In Kindergarten we have seen an increase of 6 % 
in F & P levels with ENL students reaching bench mark. In First  grade we have seen a 6% increase in ENL students reaching 
bench mark and in Second grade ENL, students have increased bench mark  by 4%.  ENL students in grade 3  have shown a 
4%  increase  at the "Above" range of F & P levels from September through June.   ENL students in grade 4 have shown a 4% 
increase  reaching bench mark from September to June in the F & P.  The data for ENL  students in grade 5 indicates F & P 
levels have not increased from September to June. 
Additionalyl formative Literacy assessments for ENL students include a Literacy  portfolio for all students in grades K-5 
including ENL students.  In addition,  ENL teachers developed ENL student specific literacy portfolios.  Upon review of the 
Literacy Portfolios as well as the ENL portfolios, ENL students have made progress from their baseline through mid-line writing 
pieces as well as from their pre to post task writing as measured by the Developmental Writing Continuum,  writing rubrics 
and New Language Progressions (Writing for Information). 
Moving forward in the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to provide professional development to all teachers  in an 
effort to continue to develop literacy strategies that support our ENLs .  Professional development topics include: 
In addition, we will continue to embed scaffolds in the curriculum calendar aligned to the Common Core standards and the 
New Language Progressions to support our English as a New Language students.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The structures we have in place to support this effort are as follows: 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The 2017-2018 summative assessments used to track areas of progress and need are as follows:  We reviewed  the Spring 
2018 NYSESLAT  in addition to the EDAT report to inform ourselves how students fared across modalities.  We noticed the 
modalities of strength by grade were as follows,  in this years First grade through  Fifth, the modality of strength continues to 
be “listening” and "speaking".  The NYSESLAT data also revealed  the modality of need in First grade through Fifth continues to 
be "writing". Additionally, overall there was a 2% increase from the 2016- 2017 NYSESLAT of students reaching Expanding and 
Commanding levels of proficiency. In all grades except second grade students scoring Entering ranged from 0 to 3%. Grade 2 
students scored 30% Entering which was a 16% increase from the 2016-2017 NYSESLAT.  A deeper analysis indicates a data 
trend of Grade 2 having the highest number of Entering ENLs. 
 
The 2017-2018 ELA State Test data analysis for our ENL students reflected the following: 61% (37) ENL students scored level 1, 
34% (21) ENL students scored Level 2, 3% (2) ENL students scored level 3 and 2%(1) scored level 4. This data indicates a 2% 
increase in moving EN students to above grade level. Analysis of the 2017-2018 Math State Test data for ENL students 
indicates the following: 66% (49) ENL students scored Level 1, 28% (21) ENL students scored Level 2, 4% (3) ENL students 
scored level 3 and 2%(1) scored level 4. Both ELA and Math State Test results indicate a need to continue to support ENL 
Students in demonstrating  grade level proficiency. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The structures we have in place are as follows; We have embedded within our Literacy Block  the Co-teach model as well as 
designed  ENL  teachers' schedule  to provide the mandated ENL instructional time as well as additional literacy 
intervention  support for our ENL students. For example, we have expanded the Wison Fundations Tier 1 Intervention from 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

grades k and 1 to now include grade 2 students. Our Literacy Block includes a word study component to ensure the systematic 
development of vocabulary instruction focusing on morphology as well as other reading strategies. Student  begin their day 
with a focus on reading through "Drop Everything and Read". Our ENL teaching model is a fully integrated as Co-Teach with 
embedded ENL and General education teacher planning time.  In addition to further support ENL students, Title III funding is 
used to create Saturday and After-school programs to support Literacy development for our ENL students. For the 2018-2019 
school year we will continue to look at the literacy block playing closer attention to Shared Reading, Guided Reading and 
Literacy Centers. Grades K-5 teacher's will continue to implement small group Guided Reading at least twice a day. We have 
also adjusted the literacy block to begin with the Fundations at the onset of the block. Second grade teachers  will continue to 
participate in the Universal Literacy Initiative which  provides teachers with intensive coaching in reading and writing to 
support student's literacy development. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The RTI team meets regularly to discuss and plan instruction for our At-risk ENL students.  At-risk ENL student data is 
monitored by the classroom teacher as well as the Assistant Principal. The student's parent/guardian is met with to discuss 
academic and social/emotional progress.   Tier I interventions are provided for the At-risk ENL student within the classroom in 
addition to the Tier II small guided reading group . If Tier I and II interventions are not successful, support  services are 
provided by our  Tier I Reading Recovery teacher and  At- risk SETSS  teachers.  During the RTI meetings, students are discussed 
with the team which includes the Principal, Assistant Principals, the classroom teacher, Guidance Counselors, and Related 
Service providers. During these meetings we discuss the students academic progress, the students home language literacy 
skills, their social emotional development as well as their years of ENL services.    The parent of the student meets with the 
classroom teacher as well as with the Tier III provider,  such as our Reading Recovery specialist and an Assistant Principal to 
discuss the next steps of intervention. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data used to evaluate and inform our ELL program are as follows:The NYSESLAT data reveals the following; 127 students 
with historical data were tested in 2018.  7% (11) of the ENL students tested scored at the Commanding level.  43% (54) ENL 
students scored at the Expanding level, 28% (35) scored at the Transitioning level, 16% (20) scored at the Emerging level and 
6% (7) scored at the Entering Level. NYSESLAT test takers in grades 3 to 5 that scored Expanding and 3 or 4 on the ELA totaled 
3.                                Upon review of the 2017-2018 NYSITELL data, out of 65 potential ENL students tested, 49% (32) of 
ENLs scored Entering, 2%(1) of ENLs scored Emerging, 6% (4) of ENLs scored Transitioning, 15% (10) of ENLs scored Expanding 
and 28% (18) of ENLs scored Commanding. In addition,  we reviewed test simulations for ENL students as well 
as  tracked Fountas as Pinnell reading levels  to determine student progress, set reading goals and develop targets to meet 
those goals.  In addition, we also analyzed student Literacy Portfolios  for the purpose of identifying and developing on going 
literacy and math goals goals.  Teachers also analyze pre and post literacy tasks to determine progress.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The following structures are embedded within the school schedule in an effort  ensure ENL classroom teachers, Co-teachers 
and administrators disaggregate data with respect to ENL students: 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

      The school uses the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT scores in order to provide the appropriate number of 
       minutes according to the specific English proficiency levels for each student.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our ENL-SWD students in Self-Contained and Co-Teach  classes work with ENL teachers who utilize the same instructional 
maps as the general education teachers together with ENL strategies. Classes with ELL-SWD follow the same Flow of the Day as 
their General education peers. ENL teachers use content based materials using ENL methodologies to ensure all students are 
exposed to Common Core Curriculum. ENL teachers also have access to students' IEP goals to ensure the success of our ENLs-
SWD. In addition, our ENL-SWDs have accessto all our programming specials such as library, dance, music, conflict resolution, 
math support, science labfor k-2 and 3-5 students.  In addition, all ENL teachers have been trained in SESIS.  All classrooms are 
equipped with SMART boards of which ENL teachers have access as to and use when they co-teach.  In addition,ENL students 
with disabilities  have access to iPads throughout the day. Technology programs available for ENL students are: MY ON, iready 
and ST Math. ENL students also are programmed to visit the Technology Lab on a cyclical bases. ENL teacher's schedules reflect

instructional materials include GO Math which includes interventions for ENL students. Math technology support includes 
iReady and ST Math.  In addition ENL students have access to Leveled Literacy Intervention, Wilson Fundations and 
scaffolded  Exemplars.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our school's ENL program we support students with the Home Language when helping Newcomer students transition to 
their new academic environment. The Home Language is used to support Newcomer students in the understanding of 
essential content Ideas.  Students are encouraged to use the Home Language in literacy and math when necessary to show 
his/her understanding of concepts as well as to demonstrate concepts they already know. The Home Language is also used in 
social situations to provide students with the social/emotional support required.  The Home Language also supports our 
Entering, Emerging and Transitional students in classroom learning as per the New Language Progressions. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

To ensure ENL students receive all required services, all ENL documentation is reviewed for linguistic and learning needs.  ATS 
reports such as the BNDC, ELPC, RLAT, RMNR, RYOS, REXH, SESIS, RADP, RCRL, ROCL, RSLR, RSFE, and RESI as well as teacher 
created tracking reports, are used to identify student linguistic needs.  Teacher's and support staff review the IEPs of ENLs with

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
As all teachers are teachers of language, all staff members at various points are trained by a certified Sheltered Instruction 
Observation Protocol (S.I.O.P.) specialist from the Center for Applied linguistics.  The training sessions take place during the 
school day.  The training includes teachers working in groups  by grade as well as individual classroom visitations for the 
purposes of Co-teaching practice.  In addition, in an effort to meet  professional development for ENL personnel as well as the 
general education teachers, we will conduct six cycles of professional development throughout the year. 
Beginning September 2018 to June 2019 our professional development plan in collaboration with administrators, coaches and 
teachers include: 
Additional professional development topics include: 
Non-pedagogic staff is trained in the following: 
Moving forward in the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to provide professional development to all teachers  in an 
effort to continue to develop literacy strategies that support our ENLs .   
Professional development topics include: 
In addition, we will continue to embed  scaffolds in the curriculum calendar aligned to the Common Core standards and the 
New Language Progressions to support our English as a New Language students. 
Our school also includes teacher's of ENL students in weekly grade professional development meetings.  During these 
meetings, our Common Core based curriculum calendar is developed and discussed. Adjustments are made for ENL students as 
part of ENL teacher planning. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our school will continue to collaborate with the Center for Applied Linguistics to work with consultants to train the staff t large 
on the S.I.O.P. model  (Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol).  In addition ENL staff members will participate in district 
provided professional development specifically geared for ENL students.  ENL Teacher's will turn-key training to ENL 
staff.  Training will take place within common planning time, grade study as well as during Tuesday teacher 
planning time. Record keeping includes training agendas, teacher logs, Professional Development Calendars, and sign-in 
sheets.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ENL teachers meet with parents of individual students to discuss academic and linguistic progress during the Tuesday parent-
outreach period.  In addition, ENL teachers can also meet with parents during their scheduled prep periods, before and after 
school.  Teachers keep a log of any contact with parents. Parent translation needs are supported as all of our  teachers of ENL 
students both free-standing and Co-teach speak  the dominant Home Language of our community (Spanish).  In addition, our 
Language Acquisition Coordinator Janett Rincon, and our Language Translation and Interpretation Plan,  ensures parents and 
teachers are knowledgeable about language/interpretation access. Out of 126 ENL students, a total of 5 parents speak other 
languages than Spanish. The DOE Translation Unit offers language support for parents  who's language needs cannot be met in 
the school.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

P.S. 310 provides a comprehensive approach to parent involvement.  Parents are provided with a monthly calendar outlining 
the array of workshops which are tailored to support parents with personal life skills topics as well as to provide academic 
support for their children.  Parents are encouraged to become parent volunteers.  In addition, parents are invited to 
participate in class trips, assemblies and after-school activities as well as on the School Leadership Team.   In an effort to 
support parents of ENL students parent activities include but are not limited to: 
*Math Workshops 
*Science Workshop. 
*NYSESLAT Orientation. 
*Newcomer Orientation. 
*Social/Emotional Child Development Workshop.  
*Saturday parent ESL classes.  
*Multicultural celebrations

Policy and Reference Guide, I, Elizabeth Cardona, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
