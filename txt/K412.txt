Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have approximately 20% special education student with IEPs. Their specific needs run the gamut from emotional 
to behavioral to academic. Specifically, their needs include cognitive disorders, learning/processing limitations, and

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths  

● Leaders make strategic decisions to organize resources concerning human, programmatic and fiscal capital so that 
school improvement and student goals are achieved 

● Leaders effectively use evidence-based systems to examine and improve individual and school-wide practices in the 
critical areas (student achievement, curriculum & teacher practices; leadership development; community/family 
engagement; and student social and emotional developmental health) that make progress toward mission-critical 
goals 

● The school leader has a fully functional system in place to conduct targeted and frequent observations; track 
progress of teacher practices based on student data, feedback and professional development opportunities 

● The vast majority of teachers are engaged in inquiry-based professional collaborations during which they analyze 
student work and teacher data and play an integral role in key decisions.  

● This practice of collaboration has resulted in school-wide instructional coherence and increased student 
achievement and teacher effectiveness, as well as teachers participating in distributive leadership structures that 
allow them to affect student learning across the school. 

Priority Needs  

● Sharing goals with a shared sense of urgency about achieving school-wide goals aligned with the vision as outlined 
in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP). 

● Effectively translate systems of observation, feedback and PD to holding administrators and staff accountable for 
continuous improvement. 

● Staff and students and families must collaboratively establish the school’s Specific, Measurable, Ambitious, Results-
oriented, and Timely (SMART) goals, which link to the school’s long-term vision for academic success.  

● Develop robust systems for monitoring progress towards these goals to bring sustained, significant improvements 
to student achievement.  

● Continue to provide teachers with targeted feedback based on classroom observations, with actionable feedback 
with next steps.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28 

 

● Facilitated peer inter-visitation as a means to improve instruction and hold teachers accountable for the 
implementation of observed best practices in their own classroom.  

● Develop clear interaction between structures and systems for guiding school improvement exist, such as an 
attendance team, the Advance teacher observation and evaluation system, and analyses of credit accumulation and 
Regents examination data.  

● Select a monthly focus in which all professional support and feedback to teachers should be devoted to one priority, 
beginning with: checking for understanding; and providing supports for students with disabilities.  

● The school leader should monitor and evaluate weekly the implementation of the monthly focus and its impact on 
improving student achievement and the quality of instruction.

● Although families/students receive many grade reports and attend quarterly parent-teacher conferences, school 
must consistently clarify the data’s meaning or implications.  

● Use important parent events, such as the quarterly parent-teacher conferences, year-end portfolio presentation, 
and Parent Association meetings, to showcase student work, to have students and parents access Pupil Path together, 
and to share learning experiences such as solving mathematics problems and conducting science experiments.

We host a 3 day incoming 9 th grade summer bridge orientation 
for both students and parents, and we host our back-to-school 
orientation/curriculum evening for all 9 th -12 th students and 
parents . We will convene sub-meetings with parents of special 
needs and ELL learners to address their needs directly. 

We disseminate 4 end-of-quarter academic report cards and 4 
mid-quarter progress reports to all families, and all will be 
accompanied by BCAM cover letter of news and information. 

We use important parent events and resources such as the 
curriculum evening, senior evenings, quarterly parent-teacher 
conferences, monthly PTA meetings, monthly SLT/Community 
School Team meetings, and our year-end Community Carnival 
and Gala, and our Kinvolved Family text outreach mechanism to 
regularly update families on academic, attendance and cultural 
information 

All our monthly PTA meetings include an accompanying parent-
supportive workshop such as understanding our grade system, 
learning BCAM art skills, and supporting our year-end portfolio 
process. We will convene sub-meetings with parents of special 
needs and ELL learners to address their needs directly.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
● We attract HQT’s through a comprehensive outreach of openings (DOE mechanisms, list-servs, teacher-training 
programs, colleague networks)  

● We engage in a rigorous, multi-step, teacher-led, interview and selection process (group interview, 2 sample 
teaching lessons, essay requirement on problem of practice, and department-specific interview). 

● We retain and nurture HQT’s by maintaining a professional and collegial working context that includes: department 
and grade teams that meet once a week, 2 x yearly one-on-ones with administration, administrative and peer 
observation/feedback system (BCAM Critical Friends Program), differentiated PD/support experience (monthly 
workshops, small group specialized PD learning groups, mentor/mentee structures, numerous school-wide leadership 
and interest-specific opportunities) and a small school environment that values democratic-decision making and 
teacher leadership.  

● We partner with a myriad of professional development initiatives and partnerships to gain support and professional 
development specific to our school-wide goal of literacy across the curriculum. 

● Staff are strongly encouraged and supported to attend external PD’s and also to lead/facilitate small group PD’s 
within the school. 

● We have a principal, and AP and an AP Intern that support specific grade teams, departments and offices so that no 
cluster of staff is left unsupported and unaccountable to the larger school goals. 

● We expose our staff to the NYC instructional requirements and CCLS enough that they understand them and agree 
with us integrating these mechanisms more explicitly in our practice.  

● We engage staff in inclusive manners in adapting our curricular mechanisms and our own performance tasks in 
ways that are aligned with NYC requirements;  

● We provide individuals, grade teams and departments the modeling, frameworks and support that they need to 
complete performance tasks and analyze the outcomes in valuable relevant ways.

● We provide adequate reflective and troubleshooting opportunities in order to refine and develop our work. 

● We expose our staff to the Danielson Framework enough that they understand it and support us adapting it to our 
use. 

● We provide staff the agency to personally select components from the framework around which they wish to focus 
and receive feedback; create mechanisms that re consistent and organized that allow staff to utilize their components 
and gain valuable feedback around them.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K412, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

BCAM HS will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The CS Strategy at BCAM is fully integrated into academic instruction, both directly and indirectly. Last year, a select 
group of teachers attended a professional learning session with AVID, at which they learned to implement multiple 
teaching strategies into their classrooms to meet the needs of diverse learners and push students to think more 
critically about the curriculum. Through our partnership with A-List Education and College Spring, our 11th grade 
cohort receives SAT tutoring in math and ELA, as well as has the opportunity to take 3 full SAT diagnostics prior to the 
April exam. As a result, our students improved their SAT scores by over 80 points, on average. Additionally, our 
partnership with College Confident gives us access to a dedicated college counselor, who worked closely with 11th 
and 12th grade teachers to guide students through the college application process, resulting in 100% of the senior 
class applying and getting accepted to at least one college or university. Lastly, through supports from the Lead CBO 
(Center for Supportive Schools), the Community School Director plays an integral role in developing instructional 
practices throughout the school, specifically by providing relevant student data to inform teacher practices.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   

Through the Community School program BCAM High School will see continued growth in the areas of 
attendance, family engagement and participation, and student success as it pertains to college access 
and readiness, through the continued building of staff capacity to support students both academically 
and socio-emotionally. Our four specific goals are as follows: 

1.  BCAM will continue to improve its average daily attendance by providing mentoring to 

chronically absent students and a daily streamlined attendance communication system, and we 
will improve on time arrival through the use of incentives and strong relationship building (both 
peer and adult). By June 2019, we will see a 2% increase in average daily attendance from June 
2018. 

2.  BCAM will continue to develop and increase the scale of our college access and readiness, as 
well as improve our graduation rates, through the development of teacher pedagogical and 
curriculum development, as well as through the college counselor’s partnership with staff to 
create authentic college experiences starting in 9th grade. By June 2019, 100% of seniors will 
be accepted to at least one college. 

3.  BCAM will increase family participation and leadership by authentically engaging parents as 
partners. We will do this through continued and routinized communication with families, a 
variety of opportunities for families to engage in the school community, and engagement of 
parent leaders on the Community School Team. By June 2018, 100% of parents will receive 
monthly updates from a BCAM staff member. 

4.  BCAM will continue to build teacher development of skills to enhance their ability to support 

students’ socio-emotional needs through the use of restorative practices, peer and adult 
mentoring, and clear and consistent advisory program. By June 2019, at least 70% (5% increase 
from June 2018) of students and teachers will respond positively on the school survey to 
questions in the Supportive Environment Section, on average.

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
If all of the components are implemented with a high level of fidelity the BCAM school community will continue to see 
a growth in student performance with regards to attendance, Regents scores, credit accumulation and college 
preparation rates. 

Goal 1 (Attendance): by prioritizing on time arrival to school, we believe we will see an improvement in 
credit accumulation and post-secondary readiness, as many students are currently behind as a result of 
not being in school on time to learn the material. As the ultimate goal is the build relationships with 
students, we hope students feel more supported at school so they can succeed in their core classes. 
Goal 2 (College and Career Readiness): By offering more awareness and access to college planning, 
students will understand what they need to do to graduate and attend a college or another future 
career path. These future orientation skills will provide students the necessary support to stay on track 
and reach their future post-secondary goals. 
Goal 3 (Family Engagement) By engaging families as partners in education, we will increase the support 
and collaboration we need to help our students success academically. Specifically, by creating more 
flexible space and time for parents to meet with teachers, and by continuing our regular communication 
through Kinvolved, parents will be aware and ready to support their child’s academic needs.  
Goal 4 (Social Emotional Supports) by creating a more supportive environment at BCAM, students will 
feel more supported and safe in taking academic risks. Furthermore, by seeing to their mental health 
and socio-emotional needs, we will create the space for students to focus on their academic work.

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

1. The full-time Community School Director (CSD) was hired in partnership with school leadership and the SLT. The 
CSD is responsible for the day-to-day management of the community school strategy. The CSD is a "community 
organizer,” facilitating and providing leadership for the collaborative process of developing a continuum of services 
for children, families, and community members. The CSD drives development of community school action plans and 
planning for sustainability. The CSD tracks the school’s progress against performance goals, reviews school data, 
supports program evaluation activities, and manages partnerships. The CSD will ensure that the community school

We will continue to meet weekly as a Community School Administration Team. The school will continue to 
authentically incorporate the Community School Director into the fabric of the school as a member of the school’s 
administrative team. The Community School Director will serve on the 9th grade team in the 2018/2019 school year, 
as well as facilitate the attendance team and the guidance team. Furthermore, the Community School Director will 
take the lead on continuing to implement and develop a strong social-emotional program through the use of advisory 
and restorative practices. We will continue to expand the school’s mentoring initiatives under the direction of the 
Community School Director. The Community School Director will take the lead on Parent Engagement activities in 
collaboration with the school’s Parent Coordinator. In the 2018/2019 school year the Community School Director will 
attend bi-weekly cabinet meetings. 

2. The Student Sorter will be used on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to identify and connect students (both 
subgroups and individuals) in need of personalized/individualized supports. Prevention initiatives and intervention 
initiatives will be tracked in the Student Sorter and this data will be analyzed regularly, in partnership with the CST 
and other key school stakeholders, to evaluate effectiveness and to implement new strategies as needed. 

 

Streamlined referral processes with BCP will be implemented to ensure that school stakeholders know when 
and how to refer students and families in need of additional personalized supports that emerge throughout 
the school year. A tracking tool will also provide a way to ensure that referrals are followed up on and that 
services are delivered in accordance with the needs presented. 

  Partner programs will collaborate with teachers and others involved in instructional programming and regular 

points of engagement will be implemented throughout the year to ensure a cohesive instructional approach 
within and outside of the regular school day. 

  Through Achievement Mentoring, mentors will regularly connect with teachers to learn about how their 
mentees are performing in class. Through this weekly interaction, teachers will also learn more about the 
work of mentors and mentees and how they can support this work in their classroom. 

  Off-site grade level retreats for students will be implemented to support students’ social and emotional skill-

building as well as connectedness to the school community. 

  The schedule of the school based social worker will be increased with a primary focus on clinical support for 

students and attendance supports 

  The community school strategy will selectively match students with ELT opportunities, including academic 

center, arts academies, targeted clubs, and special projects and programming. 

 

3. In partnership with the principal, the CSD will form and subsequently convene monthly meetings of a Community 
School Team (CST) whose membership will include: members of the School Leadership Team (SLT), other key school 
staff and/or faculty, key staff from other partner CBOs, parents, and students. Through this meeting, issues will be 
regularly communicated to and discussed by the group. An annual Community School Forum will engage parents in 
authentic discussion to learn about the community school strategy and provide feedback on areas of success and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

areas for improvement. Surveys and focus groups with parents will also be held at key times throughout the school 
year to inform continuous improvement. 

 

The CSD will also work with the Parent Coordinator and identified parent leaders to define and implement strategic 
initiatives to better engage parents in their child’s education and support the community school. Planned initiatives 
designed to support authentic parent engagement include: 

  Kinvolved -- real-time attendance tracking and text messaging to parents from teachers and other school 

staff, designed to provide real-time, actionable information to parents about their child’s progress and open 
up lines of communication between parents and teachers. 

  Parent resource room -- an open, welcoming space where families are invited to learn about and take 

advantage of resources available in the school community. 

  Monthly positive parent outreach -- parents of Achievement Mentoring mentees will receive specific positive 

progress updates from mentors on at least a monthly basis. 

 

We will continue to host monthly Community School Team meetings and PTA meetings, including supportive 
workshops for families. BCAM will also be focused on redesigning parent-teacher conferences to be more 
personalized and student-led. This year, we will also include a photography workshop series for families to coincide 
with PTA meetings, so families also have the opportunity to immerse in a sample of our art programs offered at BCAM 
We will also be introducing a winter arts event to build on the spring gala and Community School Forum a.nd inviting 
parent participation in student portfolio presentations.  

 

1. The principal, CSD and other members of the Student Success Team will meet for one period on a weekly basis to 
review the Student Sorter, using the meeting agenda protocol recommended by NYCDOE. During this meeting, the 
team will review attendance trends and specific student cases to identify and implement next steps and 
interventions. If questions arise about Student Sorter data, the CSD will serve as the school’s liaison to New Visions’ to 
address questions and build capacity within the school around Student Sorter proficiency. In addition the CSD will sit 
on the school’s cabinet that meets bi-weekly.. The CSD will also serve on the 9th grade team in the coming school 
year.

  With the use of Kinvolved we will train and support the use of teachers taking period by period 
attendance to ensure accurate daily attendance and identify and students who are chronically 
late or maybe cutting several academic periods throughout the day. We will also use this tool 
to create regular two-way communication between staff and families to inform them about 
school-based events, as well as give regular updates regarding their child. 

  Through our College Access partners CARA, College Confident, and College Springs we will 

provide college readiness for our students during our weekly advisory periods. All students will 
participate in at least one college trip throughout the school year. Both our Junior and Seniors 
will be offered the opportunity to experience an overnight college trip as well as visit will 
college admissions representatives during the school day in the fall and late spring. 

  Brooklyn Center for Psychotherapy (BCP) will provide a social worker 5 days a week to provide 

1-1 counseling and supportive student groups. 

  Through our Lead CBO, CSS, we will continue our Achievement Mentoring program to match 

adults in the building with at-risk students, to provide academic, socio-emotional, and 
attendance supports. The Community School Director will also attend CSS’s training on Peer-
Group Connection (PGC) to begin to implement a peer mentoring club at the school that will 
enhance student voice and leadership, and offer support for incoming 9th graders. 

 

 

2. The Community School Team will include: principal, parent leaders, teachers, student leaders, CSD, 
BCP clinician, representatives from all partner organizations, and other community partners. A meeting 
will be provided prior to each meeting via email to all participants. Meetings will begin with a team-
building “check-in” and proceed to review progress on community school goals. Meeting structures will 
be implemented (such as pair share, small group activities, etc.) to ensure equity of voice in providing 
feedback and input. Each meeting will end with time for reflection on the meeting, identifying 
“takeaways” and an email will be sent to the group by the CSD recapping the outcomes and next steps 
identified in the meeting. 

 

3. The Student Sorter will be used on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis to identify and connect 
students (both subgroups and individuals) in need of personalized/individualized supports. Prevention 
initiatives and intervention initiatives will be tracked in the Student Sorter and this data will be 
analyzed regularly, in partnership with the CST and other key school stakeholders, to evaluate 
effectiveness and to implement new strategies as needed. Partner organizations will also be required 
to provide monthly reports documenting progress against stated outcomes and these updates will be 
discussed in monthly check-in meetings with the CSD. During the summer of 2018 we will reach out to 
the incoming 9th grade students to confirm enrollment and attendance in the 2017/2018 school year, 
as well as hold a Summer Bridge/Orientation for all new students. We will also use incoming data to 
connect with students who maintained a low daily attendance rate during the 2017/2018 school year 
to offer interventions and perhaps set up a plan for additional supports prior to the start of the 
2018/2019 school year. Based on collected data from the 2017/2018 school year we will create an 
attendance subgroup to provide support for student who fell within the 60-80% daily attendance 
range. This group will be comprised of the CSD, CSA, Social Worker and Social Work Intern.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our ELLs are assessed on an ongoing basis with the help of teacher's assessment and observation data to drive teaching goals 
and instruction. Additionally, NYSESLAT provides us with a great amount of information about our ELLs who are making 
incremental gains by moving to the next level of proficiency or test out. Based on the 2017 NYSESLAT scores 4 of our ELLs 
tested out, 12 improved their proficiency level.          
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

This year BCAM has prioritized common planning and it is now part of the schedule.Thus, content area teachers meet during 
common planning time with their ICT teachers and work collaboratively to establish goals and expectations for our school's 
instructional plan, which are then utilized to drive instruction. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ENL program BCAM implements is successful because of the strong collaboration between content area teachers, 
ICT teachers and the ENL teacher. This can be measured by our students' NYSESLAT results, their progress from one proficiency 
level to another and across language modalities. Also, our data reveals that our ELLs are passing their content area classes and 
are meeting the credit accumulation requirements for promotion to the next grade level. Additionally, students' progress is 
closely monitored by analyzing the summative assessments such as the Regents exams, NYSESLAT as well as report cards, 
midterm exams and final projects. In department meetings, each content area teacher will create a MOSL assessment that will 
emulate their content area Regents exams and which will be aligned with their current unit standards. Subsequently, these 
results will be analyzed and used to drive instruction tailored to students' individual needs. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In department meeting, content area , ICT, ENL and service providers meet and analyze data that has been gathered. The 
findings are used to guide future instructional planning, accommodations and interventions for all students, including ELLs.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Ever since we have started to use NYSITELL as measurement for a assessing new entrant's English language skills, we have 
noticed that the proficiency level given by this state exam is more accurate than the LAB-r and is closer to the one given by the 
NYSESLAT. We have also noticed, that the speaking part is more challenging for students as in the past most of our students 
would obtain a high score or even the maximum. We inferred it has to do with the more prevalent use of academic 
vocabulary. Thus, this year all ELLs will take an Academic Vocabulary class as part of the program created by Dr. Kate Kinsela..    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The structures BCAM has in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to our program are staff 
participation in protocol and agenda-driven grade and department meetings where teaches are engaged in inquiry-based 
professional collaborations during which they analyze student work. This practice of collaboration has resulted in school-wide 
instructional coherence and increased student achievement and teacher effectiveness, as well as teachers participating in 
distributive leadership structures that allow them to affect student learning across the school. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

BCAM implements a Freestanding ENL program where ELLs are grouped heterogeneously. This year 9th graders ( 1 
transitioning, 5 expanding and 2 commanding) are receiving integrated ENL in their Living Environment class 5 times a 
week, 10th grade ELLs (3 emerging, 1 transitioning, 4 commanding) will have intergrated ENL in their Earth Science 
and ELA 5 times a week each class. 11th graders (1 transitioning, 2 expanding, 1 commanding) will be receiving 
integrated ENL in their US History class 5times a week while 12th graders (3 transitioning, 3 expanding and 3 
commanding) will be receiving their mandated integrated ENL in their Government class 5 times a week. As extra 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

support the entering/emerging and transitioning ELLs will receive a Reading Circle elective class that meets 5 times a 
week.  
    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The school ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 
program as follows: entering will receive 540 minutes of ENL instruction per week; emerging will receive 360 minutes , 
transitioning and expanding will receive 180 minutes while commanding will receive their mandated 90 minutes per week. 
Since all ELLs are going to be receive a Reading Circle elective their mandated minutes are going to be exceeded.  As 10th 
grade has the only emerging ELLs we will implement an integrated ENL in their ELA class, while the rest of ELL from different 
grades are going to receive integrated ENL in content area classes and not ELA..  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The primary goal of this program is to assist students in achieving English language proficiency within three years. Our ENL 
program is run by our certified ENL teacher, Andreea Calin and its purpose is to amplify the literacy and academic skills of ELLs, 
to incorporate recognized and researched based ENL instructional strategies across content subject areas and to give students 
the skills to perform at city and state grade level in all subject areas.  
Teachers differentiate content area instruction by providing visual aids, realia, math manipulatives, using total physical 
response, flash cards and bilingual dictionaries. Vocabulary plays a paramount role and it is provided to students when pre-
reading is facilitated and as mentioned before, all ELLs will be part of the Academic Vocabulary program. When possible ELLs 
are provided with books in their native language to facilitate understanding of the content area taught.  
  
Materials for Math: Delta Math, Kahoot, Plickers 
Social Studies: Access series, translated version of textbooks 
Science: Access Series, translated versions of textbooks. 
ELA: Leveled reading - Penguin Series, Graphic novels 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   BCAM ELLs are informally evaluated in their home languages throughout the year as it is paramount to learn English. Also, 
during ENL classes, and not only, they utilize cognates, dictionaries and glossaries, a buddy system for our entering and 
emerging ELLS and answers in their native language.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  
Plan for SIFE:  
              We currently have no SIFE, but in the event we would have the following strategies in place: intervention would serve 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

as an extension of the regular school program, grade appropriate instructional support materials, differentiation of instruction 
in all areas.   
Plan for newcomers: 
        When a new student is registered in our school, we provide the following resources to facilitate the transition: 
          A formal student orientation, meeting with administration, buddy system identifying a similar student in his/her class 
that will assist during the day, students will participate in the seminar classes offered by our school and extended day 
activities. Additionally, they are provided with and array of strategies and materials in a pull-out setting to aid their instruction: 
scaffolding picture dictionaries, photo cards, realia, manipulatives etc, exposure to Academic Vocabulary program, after school 
academic centers where students receive extra help with their classwork.  
Plan for Developing: 
            After school academic centers targeting reading and writing,  monitoring the progress of students in all content areas to 
differentiate instruction for  literacy needs, exposure to Academic Vocabulary program. 
Plan for long-termn ELLs: 
          Our action plan for this group of ELLs who based on their NYSESLAT, ELA and Math test tend to struggle with reading and 
writing the most includes: using formative assessment to guide instruction, focusing on building students' oral and written 
academic language, encouraging primary language development, exposure to Academic Vocabulary program, after school 
academic centers. 
Plan for former ELLs: 
        The progress of students making the transition out of ENL classes is closely monitored. Additionally, former ELLs continue 
to receive testing modifications on Regents exams for two years after they achieve the proficiency level on the NYSESLAT, plus 
90 minutes of instruction utilizing the Academic Vocabulary Program by Dr. Kinsela.  
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  
                ELL-SWDs are provided with modified texts and assessments based on level and group activities, time extension, 
grade appropriate instructional support materials - Ipads, laptops and computers in order to provide access to films and 
documentaries, use color coding and highlighting, provide visuals for emphasizing important points etc.  Additionally, there is a 
strong collaboration between the ENL teacher and IEP contact person, and a paraprofessional, Mrs. Balbuena that shadows 
some ELL-SWDs' schedules.  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
            We review IEPs regularly to ensure that students are programmed appropriately, and receive mandated modifications 
and support services as well as their mandated ENL classes. When the goals stipulated in their IEPs are achieved, the ELL-SWDs 
are moved to a least restrictive environment. All BCAM students are placed in elective classes that they select for themselves.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All of the interventions services in our school are offered in English. 
ELA: 
In order to assist our students in both academic achievement and assessment, there is a variety of solutions that we are 
working with this year. They include the following: 
• Ensure adequate licensed personnel to deliver instruction as stipulated by NCLB and CR Part 154 
• Collaboration between content area and ENL teachers to create a learning community which is knowledgeable and 
experienced in researched based Instructional Strategies 
• Analyze ELLs data to become well-informed about the performance of each ELL in order to make sounded educational 
decisions. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

• Provide opportunities for students to be involved in purposely conversations 
• Incorporating all language modalities during the lesson, e.g. group discussions, journals 
• Ensure that teachers analyze students’ data to identify strength and weakness and utilize the findings to drive and 
differentiated instruction  
• Encourage teachers to participate on professional development opportunities focusing in instructional strategies for ELLs  
• Implement a print rich environment, use of ENL dictionaries in the ELA classrooms. 
  
Math: 
In order to assist our students in both academic achievement and assessment, there is a variety of solutions that we are 
working with this year. They embrace the following: 
• Ensure adequate licensed personnel to deliver instruction as stipulated by NCLB and CR Part 154 
• Analyze ELLs data to become well-informed about the performance of each ELL in order to make sounded educational 
decisions. 
• Provide opportunities for students to negotiate with mathematics academic language, e.g. reading and solving word 
problems, 
interactive word wall 
• Incorporating writing as a component of the mathematics lesson, e.g. journals 
• Provide opportunities to convey to others problem solving strategies and the justification of their answer 
• Ensure the identification and analysis of student strength and weakness to drive and differentiated instruction 
• Collaboration between content area and ENL teachers to map out student specific needs. 
• Encourage Math teachers to participate on professional development opportunities focusing on ELL instructional needs. 
  
Social Studies  
-Monitor the understanding of linguistically challenging materials and use of variety of phrasing techniques and synonyms to 
clarify meaning  
-Scaffold instruction with visual aids, maps, atlases, glossaries, and dictionaries to increase comprehension 
 -Provide our Spanish-speaking ELLs with a Spanish version of texts 
  
Science  
-Provide Spanish-speaking ELLs with a Spanish version of texts  
-Ensure that teachers modify assignments, classwork, and assessments using online translation tools  
-Ensure teachers are informed about videos available online to illustrate processes and concepts 
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

As some of our ELLs tend to have a score lower for the reading modality of the NYSESLAT, we will look into acquiring the 
Achieve 3000 program.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We are not going to discontinue any of the services we currently offer our ELLs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs which include Academic Centers that meet twice a week where 
students who struggle in classes are given extra support. These sessions often are used to focus on skills and competencies 
important on Regent exams. We also have strategic Regent Preparatory sessions during after school times as we near Regent 
exams dates. Additionally, there are numerous extra-curricular activities available to all BCAM students, including ELLs. These 
seek to foster further inclusivity into our school and include: competitive Athletics providing a range of team opportunities for 
young men/women PSAL basketball, football, track and soccer clubs; extra-curricular clubs/advanced academic courses; 
student council, College Now, Diamond Squad, design club, Reel Films;  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our certified ENL teacher, Andreea Calin uses a variety of instructional materials in order to better support our ELLs' needs. 
Thus, Milestones Introductory is used to teach ur entering and emerging students survival language as well as the beginning 
academic skills that they need to navigate through their school environment. All ENL units are infused with arts and 
technology, i.e photoshop, imovie etc. Alongside this program, we also utilize the online Reading Horizons program which 
teaches phonics in an explicit, systematic and multi-sensory fashion. As students build these foundational skills, this program 
layers in activities that promote pronunciation, vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension development. We also use Azar 
grammar books to give extra support in grasping language. Our intermediate and advanced ELLs are exposed to teacher-made 
common core alligned unit plans which give ELL the extra support they need to obtain a passing grade on their ELA regents. 
Furthermore, this year we will start implementing the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit by Dr Kate Kinsela twice a week during ENL 
class.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

BCAM has made a conscious effort to use ELLs' home language to support delivery and acquisition of content and skills. Thus, 
students are given ample opportunities to utilize dictionaries and glossaries, written and oral response in their home language, 
and translated versions of textbooks and/or class materials.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our ELLs have access to all of the required services/resource support and correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels. Students 
are exposed to a multitude of hands-on activities, use of technology, etc.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs as well as resources. In advisory classes we are implementing a new 
curriculum which will address the socioemotional needs of all our students.We also have strategic Regents Preparatory 
sessions during after school times as we near regents exam dates. Additionally, there are numerous extra-curricular activities 
available to all BCAM students, including ELLs. These seek to foster further inclusivity into our school and include: competitive 
Athletics providing a range of opportunities for young men/women PSAL basketball, football, track and soccer clubs, extra-
curricular clubs/advanced academic courses, Student Council, College now, Diamond Squad, Design Club, Reel Films. DICE, 
AVID, BCAM Globetrotters Travel Abroad Program, the Future Program, Exploring the Arts (ETA) Arts Integration partnership. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
In order to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year, BCAM hosts a 2-day incoming 9  th   grade 
summer bridge orientation for both students and parents where school culture is explained,  expectations, rules and school 
system are presented and academic experiences are modelled. Also, during these two days of orientation, our ENL teacher 
Mrs. Calin meets with parents of ELLs to inform and explain the ENL program BCAM implements. The school staff involved in 
these activities are: administrators, grade team leaders, PTA offciers, Parent coordinator and ENL teacher. When needed, we 
utilize our bilingual staff or the Office of Translations and Interpretation to facilitate communication with parents of ELLs.

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
BCAM staff development seeks to create ongoing and systematic opportunities for emphasis on Common Core standards and 
high impact differentiated and academic language development strategies. Our PD program includes: PD Pods where teachers 
are given the opportunity to choose the PD pod they are interested in and then rotate. Also, our teachers have ample 
opportunities to attend professional conferences and workshops; twice-monthly departmental meetings around department-
specific curriculum, instruction, student support (ELLs included); twice-monthly grade-team meetings around grade-specific 
curriculum, instruction, student support; teachers will engage in internal and external intervisitations to engage in 
collaborative feedback and sharing of best practices around differentiated questioning/discussion techniques.

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
  
The PD pods we utilize in our school will meet twice monthly on Mondays, 4 sessions per quarter and as mentioned above, our 
ENL teacher will deliver a PD pod on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction 
for English language learners on ELLs and student support. Also, all teachers will be informed by Mrs. Calin about workshops 
and conferences available through DELLSS. Agendas and attendance sheets are kept in staff personal files.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, James O'Brien, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Parents are surveyed at registration, start of school orientations through phone calls to families and via letters in 
order to identify language preference. These forms are reviewed together with the blue cards available in the 
main office in regards to students's needs and home information. Brooklyn Community Arts and Media high 
school also uses ATS report to indetify all home languages using the UPPG code, HLIS for newcomers in addition to 
ethinic report and UPCO code.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Language  

All our new families 
participate in a full school 
orientation before students 
begin school. They meet with 
administration, counselors, 
and parent coordinator 
where their language needs 
are assessed.  

• We require our families to 
participate school events a 
minimum of 8 times per 
year, and are constantly in 
contact via various outreach. 
Thus, we believe we know 
our families know informally 
their translation and 
interpretation needs. We 
plan to, however, engage in 
formal and comprehensive 
needs assessment regarding 
these needs (See below).  

• Our families are 
dominantly English speakers 
and readers. We have a 
small percentage of families 
that speak/write Spanish as a 
primary language. Further, 
we have a small percentage 
that speak/write in Arabis as 
well as various African and 
Caribbean 
languages/dialects including 
French and Creole.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A.
