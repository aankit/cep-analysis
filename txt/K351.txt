Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets, the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             8

School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 

Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you

monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title 

I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

Vision 

The Unison student leaves our school with a deeply developed understanding of self, a broad sense of the world, 
deep conceptual understandings in STEAM & Humanities, and the ability to be active agents in their own lives and 
communities.  

 

Mission 

Unison CARES deeply about each and every child and seeks to provide individualized support for all students so 
that every child’s potential is unleashed. Unison CARES deeply about the families and the communities that our 
students are a part of and considers itself to be of service to all three. 

Unison CARES deeply about social justice seeing public education as an opportunity to prepare youth to be 
thoughtful and actively engaged in bettering society. 

Unison CARES deeply about equity and disrupting our society’s many inequities. Unison works to build an 
environment and a curriculum that tackles injustice, gives students access to the critical thinking skills necessary to 
identify injustices, possible solutions and access to the communication skills necessary to advocate for themselves, 
their communities and for our society at large.  

Unison CARES deeply about providing each and every student the dignity and respect they deserve. 

Unison CARES deeply about the truth and providing our students access to curriculum that reflects truth and that 
reflects our students’ identities. 

Unison CARES deeply about providing our students the opportunity to engage in learning that is enriched, relevant 
and based in the real-world. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Unison partners with Citizen Schools to extend the learning day for all students. Citizen Schools is a program built on 
bringing community members and professionals to the classroom, in which students mirror potential career 
opportunities in apprenticeships. Students participate in 4 career and technical apprenticeships with professionals 
from various STEAM fields to engage in authentic project-based learning cycles that are 10 weeks long. Students also 
spend one hour daily with AmeriCorps Fellows getting homework help and additional academic supports.  

 

Unison students also all have access to a unit of study in Hydroponics and Coding in the 6th grade in order to prepare 
them to major in one of these STEAM Career and Technical Programs in 7th and 8th grade. Unison has its own 
Hydroponic Lab on the 3rd floor of the school and is working with the Brooklyn Borough President and local 
Councilwoman to build an all-seasons Hydroponics Greenhouse.  

 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             11 

 

The Unison School is working with its Community Schools CBO, Replications, to build out multiple STEAM Career and 
Technical Programs in Career and Technical Labs within the school building as well as to partner with key Career and 
Technical High Schools for students to visit and to bring in High School students as mentors.  

 

The Urban Assembly Unison School is dedicated to partnering with its local community in Brooklyn to bring state-of-
the-art Enriched program offerings to our students to ensure that they engage in meaningful learning as middle 
school students.  

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The school serves Students with Disabilities (SWD) including students who are classified as Learning Disabled, Other 
Health Impaired, and Emotionally Disturbed.  

The school serves English as New Language Learners (ENL) who range from beginners to transitioning level students. 
Our ENL students speak Arabic, Urdu, Bengali, French, French Creole, Fulani and Spanish. The ENL students mainly 
come from: Yemen, Senegal, Haiti, Bangladesh, Dominican Republic, and Panama. 

The school also serves students who are overage - meaning that they have been retained in prior grades at least once 
in their schooling.  

More than 80%of the incoming students to Unison as 6th graders come having scored below grade level in ELA and 
Math on the NYS Exams during their Elementary School years.  

There are 15+ students classified as being Students in Temporary Housing which includes students in foster care, in 
doubled up homes and in shelters.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The school made vast improvements in 2017 - 2018 based on the CEP goals.  

In terms of the Rigorous Instruction goal, our students made record growth in Reading based on our Spring Degrees of 
Reading Power assessment results - an assessment that measures growth in reading comprehension. Our students 
also made record growth in math achievement as measured by the iReady Math Assessment. There was an 
improvement in both the quality and quantity of student work products in all subjects because we emphasized 
portfolios as a means of tracking student progress towards year-end promotion criteria.  

In building our Supportive Environment, our students, teachers and parents report high levels of trust and an overall 
feeling of security and safety based on the NYC School Survey.  

In terms of supporting the teacher teams to build up teacher collaboration, the school has a higher than average 
response rate from teachers on questions pertaining to professional collaboration.  

And, one of the school's continued priorities this year was to use the School Leadership Team to function as a cabinet 
for the school. We were intentional about building a true leadership team comprised of key stakeholders to review 
school data and to make recommendations for improving the school's overall implementation of action plans related 
to its CEP goals. This initiative was closely tied to the goal for collaborative teachers as well.  

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             12 

 

The school's priority and focus for the 2017 - 2018 school year was to increase the time that students are thinking in 
class about rigorous and engaging tasks and questions. This priority included offering these opportunities to students 
with disabilities, English as New Language Learners and general education students so that all students engage in 
enriched learning opportunities to ensure all students to make growth.  

We are very proud and excited by the growth we have made this year and look forward to continuing in our 
improvement efforts in the year to come.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Curriculum Strengths: 

The Urban Assembly Unison School values problem-based curricula that include opportunities for students to engage 
in Higher-Order Thinking while working on relevant, rigorous, engaging tasks. We use Problem-Based Inquiry Science - 
PBIS - in Science, NYC Passport Curriculum in Social Studies, Big Ideas Math in Math and Great Books in ELA this year.  

The Urban Assembly Unison School teacher teams prioritized co-planning units, unit assessments and lessons this 
year. The teachers’ professional periods were almost entirely dedicated to co-planning with teachers who co-teach in 
the same classes and with teachers who teach the same curriculum to the same grade level. Administrators 
supported these co-planning sessions in service of building teacher capacity in the backward planning framework. 
Teacher teams built a minimum of 3 fully planned units of study per subject area per grade that include the unit plan, 
the unit assessment and lesson plans. These unit plans were reviewed and improved with support from coaches and 
administrators.  

 

Instruction Strengths: 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             16 

 

The teaching staff at The Urban Assembly Unison School value students engaging in Higher Order Thinking each and 
every day through strategic, well-planned, rigorous, and engaging tasks and utilizing instructional routines that 
include student discussions and student writing through thinking routines. We know that when students are thinking, 
they are learning and we know that when they are sharing their thinking verbally and in written form, then their 
thinking can be pushed and responded to which in turn pushes them to think more critically.  

The Urban Assembly Unison School has developed a set of concrete “look fors” that describe the best practices that 
should be observed in each lesson, each day along with the descriptors of how instructional practices should be 
impacting students. These “look fors” allows for the school to have more consistency in instructional practices around 
student discussions, teacher questioning, student engagement and assessment. In the teacher co-planning periods, 
teachers were supported in planning for the instructional routines that would best support student thinking and 
student engagement. We worked closely with consultant, Rhonda Bondie, from Harvard to implement “thinking 
routines”.  

Assessment Strengths: 

The school implements a quarterly exam structure for each core content class with an aligned professional 
development schedule so that teachers can analyze the quarterly exam data and adjust instruction accordingly. 
Teachers use a formal data analysis protocol and document accordingly. This data analysis helps teachers to evaluate 
their students’ strengths and needs as well as instructional strengths and needs.  

 

 

Our focus for 2017 - 2018 has lead to positive outcomes.  

Outcomes from the NYC School Survey: 

  The overall Rigorous Instruction score on the Learning Environment Survey is a 3.56 

  There was a 97% positive response rate by teachers on on the Common Core shifts in ELA. 
  There was a 89% positive response rate by teachers on the Common Core shifts in Math.  
  93% of teachers reported that they design instruction that is matched to their students’ needs.  
  100% of teachers reported designing instructional programs together.  
  100% of teachers reported that they discuss instruction with one another. 

Outcomes on the NYS ELA and Math Exams: 

  Our percent of students scoring proficient on the NYS Math Exams significantly increased from 5% (2016 - 

2017) to 17% (2017 - 2018). 

  Our percent of students scoring proficient on the NYS ELA Exams significantly increased from 15% (2016 - 

2017) to 27% (2017 - 2018). 

 

Curriculum Needs: 

We have made many strides in planning rigorous, engaging curriculum tasks and building units to support students in 
developing the concepts and building the skills necessary to complete those tasks. Our next area of focus is to 
vertically and horizontally align our curriculum to maximize interdisciplinary connections and alignment as well as to 
provide our students with more strategic and consistent exposure to concepts and skills. Our teachers will continue to 
build their capacity to backward design their units from a set of curriculum maps that support vertical and horizontal

alignment. Our teachers will also continue to build their capacity to use unit and quarterly assessments more 
strategically to identify strengths and needs in the curriculum as well as to adjust curriculum as needed.  

Instruction Needs: 

Based on the New York State Integrated Intervention Team Review in March 2017 and based on an analysis of the 
Degrees of Reading Power Assessment and iReady Assessment, teachers need to utilize instructional practices that 
promote student engagement in thinking, communicating about thinking with one another and in writing and that 
also is planned to meet the needs of all the variety of learners in the classroom.  

Assessment Needs: 

With a more formalized exam/assessment structure in place, it is necessary for teachers to focus this year on 
implementing more formative assessment daily and weekly to adjust instruction at more frequent intervals. Teachers 
also need to focus on giving students more frequent and meaningful feedback.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

Goal: Unison aims to build a rigorous and engaging curriculum with access points for all students to engage in critical 
thinking about essential concepts, consistent communication about essential concepts and who therefore achieve at 
high levels. Unison will accomplish this by continuing to refine units of study focusing on rigor and relevance and by 
implementing consistent thinking routines so that all students engage in discussion around Higher Order Thinking 
questions in each lesson (including students with disabilities and ENL students). Unison will also be implementing an 
academic enrichment period once per day for students to engage in coursework targeted to their individual needs. 

SMART GOAL: 

Increase the percent of students proficient in ELA by 10% by Spring 2019.  
Increase the percent of students proficient in Math by 10% by Spring 2019. 

 
 
  75% of our ELLs and SWDS will make growth of more than one full year in ELA and Math as measured by DRP 

and iReady by Spring 2018.

planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
Students will take quarterly exams in all core classes, DRP assessments quarterly and iReady assessments quarterly.  

By mid year, 75% of all students should have shown at least one full year of growth on the DRP and iReady 
assessments and a minimum of 75% of SWDs should have shown more than a year of growth on the DRP and iReady. 

By mid year, 90% of students with a history of scoring Levels 3 and 4 should be receiving a Level 3 or 4 on their Mid 
Term exams which are aligned to the NYS assessments.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

The school made improvements in establishing a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, and 
challenged by their teachers and peers as evidenced by the following statistics from school year 2017-2018: 
- An overall increase from 3.39 to 3.51 on the Learning Environment Survey in the category of Supportive Environment 

 

 

Significant improvements in terms of teacher-perception about student behavior including the following shifts in 
the Learning Environment Survey: 
- In 2017 - 2018, 87% of teachers reported students following rules in class, up from 73% in school year 2016 - 
2017. 
- In 2017 - 2018, 87% of teachers reported students pay attention when they’re supposed to, up from 73% in 
school year 2016 - 2017. 
Improvements were also reported in terms of student-perception about student behavior including the 
following shifts in the Learning Environment Survey: 
- In 2017 - 2018, 70% of students reported that discipline was applied fairly in their school up from 62% of 
students having perceived that discipline was applied fairly in 2016-2017. 
- In 2017 - 2018, 91% of students reported that they felt safe in their classrooms, up from 86% in school year 
2016 - 2017.

- In 2017 - 2018, 69% of students reported teachers support them when they're upset, up from 65% in school 
year 2016 - 2017. 

  Decrease in OORS level 4-5 incidents from 21 to 14 (changing the ratio from .14, to .09 incidents per student). 
  Decrease in Classroom Removals, Principals and Superintendent Suspensions from 37 - 30 (changing the ratio 

from .25, to .19 incidents per student). 

However,  

  We aimed to decrease total incidents per student but instead saw a decrease in level 1-3 incidents from 18 to 34 
(changing the ratio from .12, to .21 incidents per student). While some of this was due to increased attention to 
reporting, attention is warranted in regards to the increase in low-Level-3 incidents. 

  While most questions showed higher perceptions from students and teachers than District and City Averages, 

the following indicators remain of concern, and merit focus for the upcoming school year: 
- In 2017 - 2018, 51% of students reported students following rules in class, down from 59% in 2016 - 2017. 
(District average: 50%; City average: 62%) 
- In 2017 - 2018, 43% of students reported students behave well in class even when the teacher isn’t watching, 
down from 55% in 2016 - 2017. (District average: 39%; City average: 46%) 
- In 2017 - 2018, 40% of students reported that students rarely or never harass, bully or intimidate other 
students at their school. (District average: 45%; City average: 49%) 

  While average daily attendance increased from 90% to 90.3% from 2016-2017 to 2017 - 2018, in school year 

2016 - 2017 41% of students were chronically absent, and this increased to 46.2% in 2017 - 2018.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Unison aims to enhance the supportive learning environment through the development and maintenance of consistent 
and supportive relationships, instruction about social emotional skills for all students and through the implementation 
of consistent, clear and supportive social norms. Unison also aims to build and enhance a focused academic culture 
across classrooms and the school writ large.  

SMART GOAL: 

By June, we aim to support improvement in the quality of student-to-student interactions, as measured by increases on 
the Learning Environment Survey in student perception of behavior and bullying (aiming to increase the percentage of 
students who report that students rarely or never harass, bully or intimidate other students by 10%, lifting this indicator 
above the city average and up to 55%). We also aim to decrease overall OORS incidents by 25% (from 48 to 36) with a 
focus on decreasing Level 3 OORS incidents (aiming to decrease Level 3 incidents by 33% from 21 to 14). We aim to 
maintain suspensions under .2 incidents per student. 

We also aim to increase the percent of students with 90+% attendance to 65%.

Jupiter Grades (behavioral & academic) 

During Summer 2018 and monthly throughout the year, professional 
development is provided about Social Emotional Learning 
instruction based on School Connect Curriculum, DESSA 
competencies and Resilient Scholars Initiative, including how to 
address and teach into SEL skills in Advisory and across myriad 
settings in the school. DESSA growth and results will be 
communicated with teachers, students and families in a manner that 
promotes reflection.  

Have two advisors per student (one from first shift and one from 
second shift) administer the DESSA assessment quarterly. This data 
will be analyzed by grade teams quarterly to identify: a) progress 
towards Tier 1 social emotional learning competency benchmarks 
and, b) help identify needed Tier 3 Interventions for individual 
students.  

School Social Worker (and Student Support Director) and 
Administration will participate weekly in Grade Team meetings 
about patterns in student behavior (as seen in Jupiter), Social 
Emotional growth trends as seen in DESSA, and mock LES surveys to 
determine schoolwide next steps needed to meet SEL benchmarks 
and goals. Meetings will also include analysis of interventions 
(positive - such as shout-outs and disciplinary - such as detention). 
These meetings will include Attendance data and attendance 
interventions monthly.  

Teachers will plan units and lessons with SEL, social process, and 
work habit objectives in mind, based on grade team and content co-

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Monthly PTA meetings, monthly Third Thursdays and Student Led Parent Teacher Conferences will focus on providing 
families with resources to communicate and explain school wide behavioral expectations and data on students' social 
emotional learning, as well as strategies to help support their continued growth in this realm. Jupiter Grades are also 
accessible by families so that family members can log in to see student behavioral referrals (celebratory and 
corrective) as well as social emotional learning skills feedback. Monthly family phone calls by Advisors will include 
updated information on students behavior and social emotional learning.  

The school will also continue its Quarterly Expanded and Extended SLT meetings to review data on school goals and to 
determine needed adjustments (as noted in the Leadership goal of this CEP). These quarterly meetings result in 
"Briefs" that are shared with the wider community.  

Community School Director, Jessica Mazo, will spearhead attendance initiatives including increased communication 
with families around punctuality and attendance. Students with attendance statistics of concern will be paired with 
Success Mentors to support their improved attendance.

The Urban Assembly Unison School is committed to inclusivity in terms of leadership and decision-making. The school 
knows that in order to be the best school possible for the community it serves, it must distribute leadership and 
decision-making as well as build capacity for leadership across the school.  

The New York City Survey results on questions about Effective School Leadership combine to a score of 3.97, a score 
above the city average as well as above the district average.  

There have been notable improvements on key questions answered by teachers about school leadership. For example: 

  93% of teachers responded positively that the principal makes clear to the staff his or her expectations for 

meeting instructional goals. This is an increase from an 80% positive response rate from FY2017.  

  100% of teachers reported that the principal sets high standards for student learning. This is an increase from a 

73% positive response rate from FY2017.  

  87% of teachers say that at their school, once they start a new program, they follow up to make sure that it's 

working. This is an increase from a 67% positive response rate from FY2017.  

  87% of teachers say that curriculum, instruction and learning materials are well coordinated across different 

grade levels at their school. This is an increase from a 67% positive response rate from FY2017.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.  
In order to continue to make progress in effective school leadership, the school will be developing a Leadership Cabinet 
that will join with the SLT quarterly to track school progress towards meeting its goals. The school's Leadership Cabinet 
will work together to meet every other week to review the schoolwide trends in each main CEP goal area as well as to 
revisit the action steps from the CEP and to ensure that implementation of initiatives is monitored frequently. The 
school will work with its Community School CBO to develop the protocols for the School Leadership Cabinet as well as 
the determine the highest leverage data points to track bi-weekly.  

SMART GOAL: 

By Spring 2019, we are looking to see that 95% of teachers respond that once the school starts a program, they follow 
up to make sure it's working.  

By Spring 2019, we are looking to see that 95% of teachers respond that all of the programs at Unison are connected to 
their school's instructional vision.

● Quarterly meetings with the SLT will analyze data in regards to Family and Community engagement. These meeting 
will include a midyear and end of year check-in to ensure: 
- Jupiter Grades indicates that 80% of students have received their monthly phone calls consistently at the midyear 
point and that 85% have received these calls consistently when inventoried the end of year.  
- Sign-in data to family events indicate that at midyear, 80% of families have attended a general school meeting or 
school event and that this expands to 90% of families reporting having done so on the NYC LES by the end of year. 
- Quarterly opportunities for families to volunteer are made visible through flyers and family email-blasts, increasing 
family attendance to events (see sign in data above) and resulting in year end NYC LES results with more than 90% of 
families indicating family volunteer opportunities.  
- Attendance data from the New Visions Heat Map (which reads from ATS attendance data) indicating that at mid 
year, at least 75% of students have 90+% YTD attendance and that at the end of year, at least 65% students have 
90+% YTD attendance.

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, 
Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, Math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to be 
SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019, Citizen Schools and The Urban Assembly Unison School will ensure that 85% of students at The Urban 
Assembly Unison School who attend ELT will make average or more academic growth on either iReady and DRP 
assessments (depending on the students' highest need area) - Reading and Math.  

 

 
Part 2 – ELT Program Type  

Is the ELT program voluntary or compulsory? 

X 

Voluntary 

 

Compulsory 

If the ELT program is voluntary, indicate how you will actively encourage the participation of all students, with the 
goal of serving at least 50% of students.  
We communicate that the school's ELT program is part of our normal school day by targeting our incoming class of 
students for the highest percentage of participation.  

 

 
Part 3 – ELT Program Description  

The ELT program will be offered to all students eligible for Academic Intervention Services (AIS), with the goal of 
serving a minimum of fifty percent of AIS-eligible students. 
Describe how the school will meet the following SED requirements for an ELT program in a Priority School: 
 

Integrate academics, enrichment, and skill development through hands-on experiences that make learning 
relevant and engaging. 

  Offer a range of activities that capture student interest and strengthen student engagement in learning so as to 

promote higher attendance, reduce risk for retention or drop out, and increase the likelihood of graduation. 

  Actively address the unique learning needs and interests of all types of students, especially those who may 

benefit from approaches and experiences not offered in the traditional classroom setting. 

  Contain components designed to improve student academic, social, and emotional outcomes, including 

opportunities for enrichment programs such as in music and art. 

  Ensure instruction in any core academic subject offered in the program will be delivered under the supervision of 

a teacher who is NYS certified in that particular content area. 

  Engage in outreach activities made to families. 

We are partnering with Citizen Schools to offer an ELT program that is built on four major program components: 
STEAM Apprenticeships, Academic, Social and Emotional Advisory periods, Interest-based Enrichment Clubs and 
school day push in/small group intervention supports.  

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             40 

 

Students are in STEAM Apprenticeships with field-based volunteer "Citizen Teachers" for 10 week cycles on specific 
projects that are then presented in Community WOWs. These Apprenticeships meet once per week each and 
students are in 2 at a time.  

Students are in daily academic support classes with AmeriCorps Fellows as their Citizen Schools Teaching Fellow. 
These academic support classes meet daily from Mondays to Thursdays. The teachers support students in completing 
their weekly Core Class homework that is assigned by Unison teachers and given directly to the Citizen Schools 
Teaching Fellows to support students. The students are also using an adaptive, individualized on-line instructional 
program during this time with students - iReady.  

 

 

 
Part 4 – ELT Program Implementation and Oversight 

Part 4a. Who will implement the ELT program? Who will oversee the program? 
1. 

Indicate the key personnel that will be responsible for implementing and overseeing the ELT program, including 
school-based staff and any high-quality community partners that will be involved. 
If applicable, describe the scope of involvement of all community partners and how the joint ELT program is 
structured. 

2. 

3.  Explain how you will evaluate the program to assess impact on student achievement. 
The principal will be the main person overseeing the program. There will be a campus director hired and supervised 
by Citizen Schools.  

The principal and the campus director will co-construct goals for the program based on student growth measured by 
iReady and DRP. The goals will be student-grouping based.  

The CS team will track the progress of their students' goal areas weekly and will meet to strategize about meeting the 
needs of the learners. The Campus Director and Principal will meet weekly and will spend 1 meeting monthly tracking 
the data for program attendance/contact hours and iready progress in reading and math. The Campus Director and 
the Community School Director will walk through afterschool classrooms together weekly to evaluate the efficacy of 
the classroom programming. The Community School Director and the Campus Director will report back to the 
principal about areas of need and action steps to make improvements. The principal, assistant principal, Campus 
Director and Community School Director will walk through classrooms together once per month to monitor 
improvement.  

 

 
Part 4b. Timeline for implementation and completion, including start and end dates. 
The ELT will begin on the first day of school and run until the last full day of school.  

 

 
Part 5 – ELT Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part 5a. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to 
implement the ELT program. 
We currently receive grant funding from the Mayor's Initiative to partially fund the ELT program and there are private 
grants that also help to fund the program. The SIG grant funds three DOE-licensed teachers as coaches to support the 
capacity of the Citizen Schools teachers in a coaching model.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate using an “X” the fund source(s) that will be utilized to support the ELT Program.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Strategy: 

The school operates under the following theory of action for Professional Development: 

If teachers get specific and actionable feedback in order to set up the systems, routines and structures of a learning-
based classroom, and if teachers have ongoing opportunities to give and receive rubric-based peer and coach 
feedback on the qualitative moves made within instruction, and if teachers have ongoing opportunities to study 
pedagogical theory, and work in teams to continuously use data to develop practice then students will develop 
agency, intentionality, metacognition and independence leading to accelerated growth in achievement. 

Activities: 

Teachers and staff are observed regularly and given rubric aligned feedback. Feedback is given in small amounts, 
focusing on the highest leverage actions to be improved. From the feedback, teachers and staff seek out supports and 
professional development opportunities to improve their practice.  

Coaching is done by a team of experienced and effective teachers, including the principal and assistant principal. 
Coaches observe teachers and coach them in the moment. The coach and the teacher also debrief the process and 
decide on next steps together. A coach offers this support to a teacher needing to grow within a specific format.  

Residencies are a special kind of coaching. A coach can take residency in a classroom for an extended period of time in 
order to increase pedagogical knowledge and improve teacher practice in the Learning Cultures model. The coach 
meets with the teacher once outside of the classroom to create an action plan. The coach is then in the classroom for 
at least three periods per week to help implement the plan. 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             46 

 

Peer inter-visitation groups are groups of teachers that rotate to eachother’s classrooms (visiting each teacher’s 
room) to observe each other in action. Groups debrief and give each other feedback based on rubrics. Then they 
discuss implications for each teachers own classroom practice. The groups are chosen by teachers, based on their 
individual needs.  

Teachers and staff belong to mixed grade content teams. They meet every other week to discuss content issues, look 
at student work and data using protocols, critique lesson plans, vet curriculum materials, and work to vertically align 
content to the CCSS. Teachers and staff also belong to grade teams which meet bi-weekly as well. Grade teams meet 
to discuss school culture issues, look at grade wide data, and do academic or behavior interventions with students of 
need. 

All staff attends an 80 minute PD one afternoon per week. The time is devoted to school-wide professional 
development coordinated by instructional leaders. Topics include building classroom effectiveness, lesson and unit 
planning, and data analysis. Two coaches are available to work on lesson plans, unit plans, or classroom organization 
with any teachers in need.  

 

Teacher teams work with administrators to lesson and unit plan at least once per week.  

Teachers and principals also attend external PDs with other schools within the Urban Assembly network. Teachers 
and principals go to other schools to observe and discuss their practices. They collaborate to problem solve and plan 
for high quality instruction and systems that support student growth.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
There is a Measures of Student Learning Committee that met in the summer and at the start of the school year to 
review last year’s data and to decide as a committee which assessments to choose for the school’s local measures and 
which assessments to weight in teacher evaluation.  

There is also a teacher who plays the role of Data Lead. The Data Lead runs staff development for teachers on 
assessment and helps the content teams to look at data, determine trends and determine more assessments needed 
in order to support student learning. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs.

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 10: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 13K351, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Unison will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             52 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
The overall CS strategy has increased the school's focus on providing rigorous and engaging curriculum tasks for 
students through our key partnerships. The school has engaged in partnerships to increase teacher capacity, to 
provide students with specialized tutoring and to provide additional academic supports during our Expanded Learning 
Time program. This extra focus on instruction throughout the school has greatly impacted the academic culture and 
environment at Unison allowing for greatly improved academic outcomes for the 2017 - 2018 school year.  

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
We will increase the percentage of students with 90+% attendance to 65%.  

We will increase the social and emotional supports offered to our students identified as "Tier 3" based on meeting 
multiple risk indicators by hiring 1 additional Social Worker to provide case management and therapy for said 
students. This will decrease the number of Level 4 and Level 5 incidents by 25%.  

 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students? 
By improving the overall academic climate at Unison to be more supportive, attending to student attendance and 
introducing specialized curriculum that is engaging and rigorous, we seek to 

1. increase our percent proficiency in ELA 30+%  

2. increase our percent proficiency in Math to 20+%.  

 

 
Part 2 – Community School Partnerships Core Services Action Plan 

Part 2a. Identify the Community-based Organization (CBO) partnerships that you will develop in ELT, Attendance 
Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & Wellness, their target student population(s), and scope of the services 
provided. As well as supporting schools’ supportive environment and attendance work, CBOs should be helping to 
support your school’s instructional focus.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Teacher-created assessments in every core subject area are given quarterly and used in conjunction with quarterly Degrees of 
Reading Power assessments for ELL instructional planning.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Based on this data we well tailor our instructional plan next year to ensure more growth with the transitioning and expanding 
students. In particular, we noticed when looking at the CCLS standards break down of this assessment that student scores 
were the strongest in terms of Key Ideas and Details, and that they need more support in terms of craft and structure. Next 
year we will address this by bringing it to students’ attention, and providing tasks that call on them to practice these skills, and 
feedback and support to improve their execution thereof.  

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             63 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use the Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) assessment to track the reading progress of all of our students, including ELLs. 
This exam is given to all students 5 times throughout the school year. For 6th grade students are expected to make an average 
growth of 6 oints, 7th grade should make 4 points growth, and 8th grade should make an average growth of 3 points. From 
September to June our ELLs on average made ten points of growth, where the national growth average is three points.  When 
we look at the data according to ESL level, we find the following growth averages:  
- Entering: 
- Emerging: 
- Transitional: 
- Expanding: 
- Commanding: 
- FELLs:  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once summative data has been gathered, our teachers assess students on a standards based grading and conferencing 
system.  We've noticed that students are currently focused on comprehension and social process skills, and are pushing 
students toward more sophisticated genre based analysis of text.  ELL students are assessed on an ongoing basis with the help 
of teachers' assessments and conferences, observations data to drive teaching goals and instruction. Running Records are also 
used which inform teachers on what and how to teach and help students with comprehension, pronunciation, spelling, and 
reading fluency. After the HLIS is given to the parents of our ELLs, an informal verbal interview is conducted with the student. 
During the interview, students are asked cultural and academic questions that are relevant to their age and grade level. The 
results of the verbal interview are then used to help determine 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school is using the Response to Intervention (RTI) model to provide our ELLs with rigorous, culturally responsive 
instruction. This model assists teachers, instructional leaders, and ELL support services with RTI implementation and they are 
familiar with documents outline and a rationale for using the RTI model with a school’s ELL population. They understand and 
implement Tier 1, 2 and 3 interventions and are also aware that the single biggest error made in placing English Language 
Learners (ELLs) into special education is misinterpreting language acquisition as a learning or language disability. 
 
All students at Unison, including the ELLs, undergo the universal screening assessment that identifies students who may be at 
risk of not meeting the standards through benchmarks and set criteria. The first one is the Home Language Identification 
Survey (HLIS) given to the guardian of a student that informs the teachers about the linguistic factors and educational 
background that could be influencing the student and their learning style. When a student is in need of ENL services, the 
literacy skills are also assessed, through the NYSITELL and/or Spanish LAB, so that the student may receive high-quality 
instructional support in the general classroom.  The progress is constantly monitored and used to inform the instruction, and 
possibly, if the rate is still much lower than the peers from the same background, make educational decisions about additional 
special education services needed. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The EDAT, formerly known as the AMAO Tool, is used by all teachers across the school, as it gives us a lot of useful data that 
can be used. The data that is provided by the EDAT allows teachers to see the level of risk for all students in the school based 
on information such as ELL status, years in the country, housing status, past performance on state exams, age of our students, 
and attendance. The data from the EDAT shows that the average risk level of and ELL at Unison is a 6. Majority of this rating is 
due to age and performance on pervious state exams. Information received from the EDAT is then shared with staff during 
content team and grade team meetings. All teachers then have the opportunity to work together to create individual plans of 
action for students. The EDAT can also be used to help teachers differentiate for the needs of ELLs. The EDAT is referred to 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             64 

 

 

multiple times during the year during professional development and teachers then refocus their ELL instruction to best fit the 
needs of the learners in their classrooms. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We make sure that a child's second language development is considered in instructional decision by placing our ELLs in 
appropriate groups according to their language proficiency level which is determined by NYSITELL, Spanish LAB, and NYSESLAT 
tests results. Our ENL program reaches beyond language learning to help students maximize their diverse talents and skills in 
the language literacy and academic subjects, like science and math. Also, in order to ensure that the students’ second language 
development is included in instructional decisions, teachers match the curriculum with the student's assessment data, 
background experience, oral language and vocabulary. They use language during the instruction that is comprehensive and 
meaningful to ELLs, using a slower but still natural rate of speech and often rephrase and repeat instruction while using 
pictures, concrete objects and videos in order to support students’ learning. 
 
For ELLs to excel academically in our school, they must meet the same rigorous state and city educational standards for their 
grade level as English proficient students. This requires more than just English language support. Our English as a New 
Language (ENL) programs uses strategies to help students access new language development and subject matter through 
English. It also provides students with ENL support tailored to their English proficiency level. 
 
The success of our ELL program will be evaluated by comparing the student Degrees of Reading Power (DRP) test scores from 
the start and the end of the school year in addition to monitoring student classroom grades and scores on standardized tests 
including the NYSESLAT, state Math, ELA and Science exams. 
 
The success of the program for ELLs at Unison is also evaluated by the monitoring of student's NYSESLAT results, their 
movement from one proficiency level to other, and overall improvement across the language modalities. Also it is strongly 
connected to the ELL students' academic achievements, cultural awareness, development of their language skills, academic 
language, performance in their content area classes and the performance on the NYS standardized tests. 
 
Additionally, our school is held responsible for making adequate Annual Yearly Progress to make sure that all ELL meet the 
states' proficient level of achievement on the state academic assessment. In addition, students need to make the Annual 
Measurable Achievement Objectives (AMAO). The students go through the proper identification process and formative and 
summative assessment to provide for individual needs and to guide instruction. The school keeps the complete data for each 
student in order to calculate growth in language proficiency from year to year. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our program implements a Freestanding Stand Alone English as a New Language and all classes are heterogeneous 
based on proficiency levels. The language of instruction is English. Program services children daily as a part of their 
language development and academic instruction. ELLs who spend the majority of their day in all-English content 
instruction are brought together from various classes for English-acquisition-focused instruction. 
 
The program helps ELL students to achieve higher proficiency and achieve the standards established for all students 
for a grade promotion and graduation. The primary goal of this program is to assist students in achieving English 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             65 

 

 

Language proficiency within three years. Also the goal is to amplify the literacy and academic skills of ELLs who 
participate in this program and to incorporate recognized and researched based ENL instructional strategies across 
content subject areas and to give students the skills to perform at city and state grade level in all subject areas. The 
school directly provides or makes referrals to appropriate support services that may be needed by ELL students in 
order to achieve and maintain satisfactory level of academic performance. 
 
The total number of students in the Unison school is 156. In our Freestanding ENL Program we have 21 students, from 
grades 6-8. They range from Entering to Expanding. All Entering and Emerging students receive180 minutes, weekly, 
of stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes, weekly, of integrated ENL. Students who are transitioning and expanding receive 
90 minutes of stand-alone services per week and 90 minutes of integrated ENL services in a content class. The content 
classes that students receive their integrated ENL services are decided by the student using a weekly sign up. Students 
must inform the ENL teacher which class they feel would be the most beneficial to receive integrated ENL services in 
for the week. The goal of the sign up method is to allow students to begin to gain the skills that are needed in order to 
practice agency in the classroom which successfully reaching Common Core and ENL standards.  The Special Education 
population has three students in the Unison school. Students with IEP are identified and served as per the IEP. 
Languages spoken include Spanish, Fulani, Arabic, Bengali, Wolof, and French. The ENL teacher sits on the ELA team 
and meets weekly with the ELA teachers to discuss class trends and planning. In addition, the ENL teacher meets with 
each content team to discuss ways in which they can support the ELLs that are in their classes, how they can 
differentiate instruction and how to lesson plans with ELLs in mind.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

When NYSESLAT results are received, the ENL programming begins for the upcoming school year. The principal provides the 
ENL teacher with the spring NYSESLAT exam scores from the Principals’ Portal. The ENL teacher drafts a tentative schedule for 
each student based on the number of minutes required based on the English proficiency level that they scored on the 
NYSESLAT. After the ENL teacher makes a tentative schedule, a meeting with the Assistant Principal is scheduled and each 
student’s schedule is then revised and finalized. All student and teacher schedules are kept in the Unison ENL shared Google 
Drive and are referenced weekly to ensure that all ELLs are receiving their mandated amount of minutes. 
 
All Entering and Emerging students receive180 minutes, weekly, of stand-alone ENL and 180 minutes, weekly, of integrated 
ENL. Students who are Transitioning and Expanding receive 90 minutes of stand-alone services per week and 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL services in a content class. The content classes that students receive their integrated ENL services are decided 
by the student using a weekly sign up. Students must inform the ESL teacher which class they feel would be the most 
beneficial to receive integrated ENL services in for the week. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
English language learners receive the same academic content as those students who are native English speakers.  The content 
area instructional component provides grade and age level appropriate instruction in the required content area subjects in 
English in a systematic and structured way, and its design to develop the cognitive skills of ELLs. In order to maximize English 
language acquisition for ELLs, and to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of 
Common Core Learning standards, the ENL teacher and content teachers work closely to deliver literacy instruction as well as 
tailor additional content instruction to meet the needs of ELLs. To help students to progress in these programs, we utilize the 
following practices: Scaffolding is an essential part of the instructional delivery, such as Modeling, Bridging, Schema Building, 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             66 

 

Contextualization, Text Representation and Metacognition. We also utilize collaborative planning between ENL, ELA, Math 
teachers and other content areas teachers for each unit to foster language development and meet the demands of the 
Common Core Learning Standards. Additionally, we continue to strongly target language development across the grades and 
content areas, creating opportunities for active meaningful engagement. In all content areas the teachers are concerned with 
the language needs of ELLs and modify their instructional language and scaffold the instruction in order to ensure students 
understanding. Beyond explicit ENL, collaboration between teachers means that there is a consideration for the language 
needs of ELLs. For example, content area teachers monitor the understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a 
variety of phrasings and synonyms to clarify meaning. Also, Math teachers devote extra class time to untangling difficult word 
problems. Social Studies teachers scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, atlases, and illustrations to increase 
comprehension. The ENL teacher modifies and supplements the curriculum in accordance with ENL teaching methodologies. 
 
Courses are taught in English and our ENL teacher differentiates lesson content for English-language acquisition. 
Differentiation strategies include research and focused discussion of key content vocabulary terms; use of graphic organizers 
to support text analysis; guided and shared reading to support text comprehension; teacher modification of key texts to 
differentiate for individual students' levels; use of pre-writing graphic organizers to support text development and 
organization; and regular, individual conferences to review students' strengths, needs, goals, and strategies. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs have diverse learning needs are based on many factors, including age of literacy in the first language and English arrival, 
home literacy, years of formal education, immigration status, disability status and cultural expectations of school. These 
factors are taken into consideration when examining performance of ELLs on standardized tests and assessments. At the 
beginning of their first year at school, students and their parents are informally interviewed to find out about the student's’ 
background. Those who speak Spanish at home and are deemed eligible, are administered Spanish LAB to determine language 
dominance. In regards to language, all ENL students are provided with the testing accommodations such as bilingual 
dictionaries and glossaries, the use of English and alternate language editions of the test or the oral test translation in a case 
where there is no translated edition provided by the Department. All translations are oral, direct translations of the English 
editions. ELLs making use of alternative language editions or oral translations may write their responses to the open-ended 
questions in their native language. ELL students may also use both an English and an alternative language edition of the test 
simultaneously.  Native language dictionaries, picture dictionaries in different languages and native language books are often 
used in the ENL classroom. Report cards and any other information on the student is given to students and parents in their 
native language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Unison’s ELL population consists of many subgroups, and they all require differentiated instruction: 
 
a) Plan for SIFE: 
 
• Provide academic intervention services as an extension of the regular school program on both push in and pull out services. 
• Making an individualized student needs assessment. 
 
• Differentiation of instruction in all areas. 
• Grade appropriate instructional support materials. 
• Communicate closely with the parents to monitor their children’s progress. 
If applicable, the student will be given the LENS exam to test their academic abilities in their home language. 
Once SIFE students are identified, Unison monitors the progress of those students and their scores on the NYSESLAT, ELA and 
Math assessments, and provides support in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs. Unison makes all 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             67 

 

existing support structures and additional ones such as ENL, Extended Day or Speech available, which could benefit the 
student. 
 
b) Plan for Newcomers: 
 
When a new student is registered in our school, we provide the following resources to facilitate the transition: 
 
• Buddy system identifying a similar student in his/her class that will assist during the day. Finding a student who speaks the 
same language as ELL can help him/her in the classroom. 
• An informal student orientation. 
• Encourage student to participate in After School activities and to involve the students in the school’s celebrations and other 
programs. 
• An informal assessment is provided to identify possible Academic Intervention programs. 
• Home school communication is an important factor for our newcomers. 
 
Newcomers are provided with a variety of strategies and materials are used to aid their instruction: scaffolding, picture 
dictionaries, photo cards, realia, and manipulatives. Those students who arrive in sixth grade or later are required to take ELA 
test after one year. In addition to the support received in ENL class, those students are required to participate in Extended Day 
program and Small Group Instruction. They are provided with the support that prepares them to participate in NYS 
assessments (e.g. ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies). Students work in small groups with their classroom teachers targeting 
specific areas of need. In addition, word to word dictionaries and glossaries are in place to support them during the tests as 
well as translated tests editions may be available. 
 
c) Plan for ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years. For the students who are in years 4-6 and Long-Term students, Extension of ENL 
services is requested. Support structures as above are provided. 
 
d) Plan for Long Term ELLs: 
 
Long terms ELLs are the large number of Ells across the grades. An analysis of their scores on the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math 
assessments suggests that their challenge is mainly in reading and writing. They are supported to reach English proficiency 
level on the NYSESLAT.  Our action plan for this group involves: 
 
• Monitoring the progress of students in all content areas to differentiate instruction for literacy needs. 
• Encourage their participation in the school’s programs to enrich their language and academic skills. Long term ELLs are 
invited to join the Achieve Now Academy that takes place during the extended learning day from 2:40 to 5:40pm. During 
Achieve Now Academy students work in a small group of 4-6 students with the ENL teacher and receive reading instruction 
and the space to practice. 
• Communicate closely with the parents to monitor their children’s progress. 
 
 
 Plan for Special Needs Students: 
  Our policy for special needs students includes: 
 
• Collaboration between the ENL teacher and IEP contact person, school psychologist and school intervention team. 
• Monitoring newcomer and SIFE student for possible special needs status. 
• Ensure that teachers of students with an IEP are familiar with students' particular needs and all services are provided 
accordingly to the IEP mandates. 
• Communicate closely with the parents to monitor their children’s progress. 
 
 As a policy for special needs students, we ensure that teachers of students with an IEP are familiar with students’ particular 
needs and all services are provided accordingly to the IEP mandates.  Unison students with special needs are integrated in the 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             68 

 

mainstream ENL program and put under the supervision of the teacher and school Special Education Coordinator. Based on 
the individual, ENL strategies and instructional methods are utilized. 
 
e) Students who have completed six years and passed the NYSESLAT are integrated into our standard educational models. 
They are eligible for two years after testing out from NYSESLAT to receive testing accommodations that also apply to the other 
ELLs and they can receive additional support as needed.  After reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT, post-ELL students will 
continue to receive language acquisition support to consolidate and further develop their English language skills. In addition, 
they will receive 90 weekly minutes of ENL support services. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The Stand Alone ENL program follows the balanced Literacy model, the school's curriculum frameworks and ENL curriculum 
guides. It combines precisely leveled, print-based learning and teaching resources combined with engaging and motivating 
interactive multimedia technology that supports language and literacy proficiency for ELLs. It also provides an ELL component 
that supports the class curriculum and provides ELLs with scaffolding. 
 
To both provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development teacher of ELL also use small 
group instruction, many scaffolding techniques, rich print environment, word walls, content areas glossaries in different 
languages and leveled books. Teachers use differentiated instruction and utilize visuals, games and hands-on activities to 
ensure the students’ understanding of content area subjects while acquiring English. Everyday there is small class instruction 
and writing activities. Students also use technology support with the computers, LeapPads, laptops and online resources. 
Furthermore, Teachers of ELL students use grade level books which also have the ENL component to differentiate the 
instruction.   Professional development meetings with classroom teachers and the ENL teacher is also very helpful tool of 
communication and resource for planning the instruction. 
 
Unison has also purchased an ESL curriculum called Language Power. This curriculum includes four levels of non-fiction text 
sets and work books to support. This is curriculum is not the only means of ELL instruction, but is used as a supplement to 
other resources and classroom material. 
 
Finally, the Humanities course content includes explicit instruction in grade-level language development strategies, such as use 
of root words, prefixes and suffixes, spelling, grammar, punctuation and pronunciation. This course content is differentiated 
supplemented and differentiated for individual students' needs during one-to-one conferences.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In our stand-alone ENL program ELLs are pulled out from the classroom for 180 minutes for Entering and Emerging students 
and 180 minutes for integrated ENL. Transitioning and Expanding students are pulled out for stand-alone ENL services for 90 
minutes per week and receive integrated ENL services for 90 minutes per week. The ENL teacher also collects data of different 
test results (Periodic Assessments, New York State tests results) which also drives the instruction for the ESL as well as the 
classroom teachers. In the classrooms, the small group activities allow for differentiated instruction. Also, during the 
assessments the children are grouped according to the standards and their abilities. The school uses articulation forms as the 
means of communication between ENL teacher and classroom teachers in an effort to maintain alignment of curricula across 
the grades with the ENL instruction. The teachers also share their curriculum maps with an ENL teacher and provide 
modifications for ELLS in their classrooms, in the least restrictive environment. During Grade level meetings teachers discuss 
ELL students’ strengths, weaknesses and progress. Teachers attend PDs in school as well as outside the school, special 
education meetings, team care meeting, IEP meetings, Parent Teacher Association meetings and others which also give them 
support and ideas on diverse needs and instructional strategies for our ELL students. In addition, our bilingual staff is always in 
place to provide additional language support for our diverse needs students. The scheduling of ELL students with IEPs ensures 
that they receive their mandated special education and EN L services in a general-education, least-restrictive environment.    
 

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             69 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs in our school for ELLs in Math, ELA and other content areas include extra one-on-one 
conferences in all classes, targeted small group instruction, afterschool math intervention, Occupational Therapy, Physical 
Therapy and Speech. The language of instruction is English. The translators over the phone or our bilingual paras are used for 
translations if necessary. IEP evaluations and parent teacher meetings are conducted for our students with special needs. 
Apart from ENL program and other intervention programs the classroom teachers are concerned with the language needs of 
ELLs, constantly monitor students’ understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a variety of phrasings and 
synonyms to clarify meaning, and scaffold the instruction with visual aids such as maps, and illustrations to increase 
comprehension. They use Cooperative reading protocols, and vocabulary quizzes to make instruction more involving and 
effective.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In the coming school year we will continue our model of integrated and stand alone ENL services throughout the school day 
and will continue to hold Achieve Now Academy during extended learning day. Based on low performance on the state math 
exam, ELLs will receive more support inside of the math classroom. The ENL teacher will also will also attend PDs on how to 
integrate English acquisition and math content. Finally, there will be a new math curriculum that will be used to help increase 
the mathematical skills and concepts of all students across the school, including English Language Learners.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All Unison students are encouraged to participate in our extended learning day program, Citizen Schools.  During this time, 
students receive academic enrichment and remediation as well as exposure to college and career readiness through 
apprenticeships with local and corporate companies and organizations.  At this time, students also participate in clubs 
pertaining to athletics and arts. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Beginner ELLs are provided with packets from their ENL teacher that include worksheets that provide level appropriate access 
to the content being delivered.  In terms of technology, classrooms are equipped with lap tops, and ELLs are afforded extra 
time using this technology during their pull-out ENL minutes.  On laptops, ELLs use programs that support their auditory and 
visual learning such as I-Ready, News ELA, Ten Marks and Khan Academy.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The Unison School only offers a Freestanding ENL program. Some of the home language supports that are given to our ELLs 
include the following: access to bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, bilingual content specific glossaries, access to translation 
technology, such as Google Translate, and tests and other resources translated into students’ home language.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Heterogeneous and homogeneous push-in and pull-out services are provided based on grade level as well as ESL level 
(Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding, Commanding or Former-ELL). 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We collaborate with the elementary school with whom we share a building to ensure consistent family communication across 
all siblings who are ENL students.

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All students are invited to participate in Summer Bridge, a program that invites students and families to practice a day in the 
life of a Unison student during the summer.  This helps students and families gain insight into the way that students learn at 
Unison, and prepare them to transition in smoothly.   New students who enroll throughout the school year are  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

None 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The primary ENL teacher is supported by professional development from the Affinity Group, The Urban Assembly.  A specialist 
from The Urban Assembly will support the ENL teacher throughout the year with quarterly off-site professional development 
tailored to ENL teachers across schools in the group. All teachers at The Urban Assembly Unison School have ENL students in 
their classroom.  As such, they will receive in house professional development that is aligned to the school’s CEP goals around 
decreasing the achievement gap for ELLs.  Teachers will sit on Content and Grade Team meetings weekly that use protocols 
that ensure the analysis of ELL work and data and the creation of materials that will support improvement in their 
achievement based on the findings. In addition, the ENL teacher provides monthly PD to each individual content team. During 
this time the ENL teacher provided content teachers with resources that can be used with ELLs, best practices, and assistance 
with lesson planning in order to differentiate for the needs of ELLs.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Teachers are provided 1 hour of monthly ENL PD in the school building, and are regularly provided with information about 
outside ELL PDs.  A log of professional development is kept that includes accounting of minutes and whether or not they fit 
into the ENL requirements.  
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  

2018-19 SCEP-P                                                                                                                                                                                                             71 

 

 

 

Individual meetings with the parents of ELLs will be scheduled after the entitlement letters are sent home. All individual family 
meetings will take place during Family and Community Engagement time during staff PD on Tuesdays from 2:40 pm to 3:55 
pm. If translation and interpretation services are needed, the NYC DOE Translation and Interpretation Service Unit will be 
called. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Currently, ELL parent involvement is very low. Once a month, ELL parents are given an ESL Family Newsletter. In this 
newsletter, parents are given updates and invites to activities that will be occurring in the school and community. ENL family 
newsletters are provided in English and parents’ home languages. In addition, the Parent Coordinator sends out a monthly 
school calendar and resources that may be helpful to families. When there are important announcements from the school a 
Robo Call is sent by the PC. The message is then translated into the preferred language that is recorded in ATS based on the 
HLIS form that parents fill out during enrollment.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Emily Paige, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At Unison, we have multiple ways of gathering information about communicating with families. First, all families 
fill out new Blue Emergency Cards when they enroll, and language preferences are entered from there into ATS. 
Then, any new ELL students are given the HLIS, and that data is used to cross check the information in ATS from 
the Blue Card. We also have a system of bi-weekly phone calls home to all families made by designated staff 
contact families, using the over-the-phone interpretation service as necessary. That staff logs all calls made, and if 
there are any language issues reported or observed, the Parent Coordinator follows up. For any students who 
were in other DOE schools prior to enrolling in Unison, their home languages codes in ATS are verified upon entry. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

interpretation service(s)?  

In our school building we have staff 
that speak Spanish, French, and 
Bengali. Those staff members will be 
able to provide interpretation services 
for families that speak those language. 
When families do not speak the 
languages of our staff we will provide 
staff with the DOE Translation and 
Interpretation phone line to have over 
the phone conversations with families.

During this event families have the 
opportunity to review the progress 
that has been made throughout the 
school year in regards to attendance, 
school programming, and other 
initiatives. Families also have the 
opportunity to provide feedback to 
the school about their experience 
throughout the year. When families 
do not speak English we will ask for a 
representative from the DOE 
Translation Unit to come join our

forum or do over the phone 
translation and interpretation. 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of an emergency, school staff will make use of the student's Blue Card. On the Blue Card it will indicate 
the parents preferred spoken language. If the preferred language is a language other than English, school staff will call 
the DOE translation and Interpretation Unit. We will then use the services of an over the phone translator to discuss 
the school emergency with the parent and discuss follow up.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During staff summer professional development school leadership will provide copies of Chancellor's Regulation A-663. 
Upon distribution the LAC and school leadership will go over the the main points of the regulation: parents have the 
opportunity to participate in their child's education regardless of language proficiency, minors are not allowed to 
provide translation and interpretation services, the availability of city wide ELL parent meetings. Staff will be provided 
with the DOE translation and interpretation phone number and the steps necessary to have a document translated 
using DOE services.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The Welcome Posters will be placed by the LAC at several prominent hallway locations within the school. Ebony Ford, 
the English as a New Language teacher, will distribute and discuss the Parents' Bill of Rights and the Parents' Guide to 
Language Access at the one-on-one conferences she holds with all parents of English Language Learners during Friday 
afternoon Family Engagement Time. The LAC will distribute the Language ID Guide to the School Safety Agents at the 
Security Desk, and ensure that copies are kept at her desk and the desk of the Parent Coordinator in the Main Office.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

All events led by the Family Engagement team include a survey at the end, and this is an opportunity for parents and 
guardians to give feedback or make suggestions. A specific question will be added to the survey about language

access. Additionally, because this is a very small school with individual staff members assigned to be the contact 
people for each parent, if there are any communication issues, there are bi-weekly opportunities for parents to share 
that information with their designated contact.
