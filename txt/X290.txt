Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of The Bronx Academy of Health Careers is to provide students with the experiences and education to 
become competent, self-confident, literate, responsible, and compassionate citizens who are ready for college and 
careers. 

We provide our students with a safe and supportive environment in which students can grow and realize their 
potential for success.  

Through the use of sound educational practices supported by mentoring, collaboration, and exposure to various 
careers and pre-college experiences, we will enable students to graduate from high school and successfully 
transition to post-secondary institutions and be involved in their communities.  

We use social and emotional learning to further build a positive school culture which fosters a more resilient and 
coherent school community geared towards the rigors of college and career readiness.  

Staff, community, and parents will collaborate to ensure that our students receive the necessary supports and 
resources they need to succeed to become stewards of good health care. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
To ensure that students receive exposure to the vast areas of health care, we have several partnerships including with 
Montefiore School Health Clinic and Montefiore Medical Center, Fordham University, and the Mentoring in Medicine 
Program. In addition, to support college and career readiness, we have partnered with CUNY Collaborative Programs 
including College Now. We are an AP for All and College Access for All school, programs associated with Equity and 
Excellence for All initiatives. We have added NYU College Advising Corps to further promote college and career 
readiness and access. 

In broad scope, in collaboration with the entire school community, our school goals are to ensure: 

Students are College Ready 
Students are provided with a positive and supportive classroom and school culture 
Instructional practices provide rigor and support all student learning 

 
 
 
  Teachers collaborate and support one another and the school 
 

Families are involved in student success and college access 

To support our goals our instructional focus is on writing and analyzing informational texts, collaborative learning, 
discussion, and catering to the needs of diverse learners. 

Our school CEP was developed in collaboration with a dedicated group of individuals who recognize the importance 
of working together to promote student success including, teachers, support staff, administrators, parents, and 
students. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Bronx Academy of Health Careers services students in grades nine through twelve. Our student population is 
comprised of approximately 13% English Language Learners and 22% Special Education students. English Language 
Learners need additional supports in language acquisition in all content areas and Special Education students need 
additional supports including those in the classroom and after school to ensure more time to master content.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our most recent Quality Review indicates, our school has progressed in ensuring high expectations and standards and 
rigor in classrooms as students are engaged in collaborative learning experiences and writing across the curriculum. 
The 2017 Framework for Great Schools report indicates our school has interesting and challenging curriculum, high 
expectations, and collaboration with the school community including teachers, parents, and students. We have 
continued to increase graduation rates, credit accumulation, and college readiness. We are focused on decreasing the 
gap between graduation and college readiness. 

Key areas for focus are a refinement of our school goals and instructional focus and include: 

● Further vertical alignment of instruction with a focus on skills to further improve writing and give students 
feedback. 

● Strategic and differentiated approaches to support student success based on student needs. 

● Improving instruction with varied Professional Learning opportunities for staff. 

● Collaborative efforts with teachers, staff, administrators, students, parents, and the community to celebrate 
accomplishments, offer supports and resources, and promote further student success. 

● Creating a welcoming inclusive setting for all involved in promoting success of students and social and emotional 
well-being. 

Our school is focusing on building a more supportive environment for students by focusing their social and emotional 
needs through staff training on restorative practices, collaborative problem solving, and crisis intervention. In 
addition, more student voice is being used to make informed decisions to support student success. In addition to 
surveys, students have the opportunity to participate in Town Halls, Student Council, Campus Council, and the School 
Leadership Team.

Common Core Learning Standards enables students to gain the necessary skills to be college and career ready.  

Classroom observations conducted during SY 2017-2018, indicate the need to align student learning activities to 
instructional shifts and focus on student engagement including student discussion, collaboration, and writing. The 
application of these skills is assessed via examinations including the NYC ELA Performance Task and the NYS 
Comprehensive English Regents. An analysis of student work and performance based on the NYC ELA Performance task 
given to all students in SY 2017-2018, indicated the need to refine argumentative writing skills as aligned to Common 
Core standards. The NYS Comprehensive English Regents results indicate that 43.5% of students in their 3rd year (Cohort 
2019) achieved a score of 75 percent or higher.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

Department Teacher Team Leaders and Administrators will work 
with teachers within their departments to analyze teacher unit 
plans, lessons, and tasks and give feedback for improvement during 
Professional Learning time. Teachers will ensure that students make 
text- text, text-world, and text-self connections in all classrooms 
and demonstrate this in writing and speaking. Teachers will also use 
protocols to analyze student work and determine student progress. 

Professional Development focused on student engagement and 
assessment will be provided to all teachers. Strategies include using 
informational text, discussion, writing and literacy strategies, 
effective questioning, engaging learning activities, and 
differentiation focusing on SWDs and ELLs. Select teachers will 
attend Professional Learning opportunities and turn-key this 
information to the staff. Teachers will also participate in 
opportunities to vertically align planning to rigorous content 
standards and skills. A school-wide writing strategy will be 
developed and communicated to staff. Castle Learning will be used 
as an instructional assessment tool for preparing students for 
Regents examinations. 

Information will be distributed to the entire school community, 
including parents via the school newsletter, parent meetings, staff 
meetings, Town Halls, our school website, mailings, Kinvolved, and 
Pupil Path. Representatives from colleges and organizations will be

The mid-point benchmark indicating progress towards meeting this goal will be based on the reports from each 
Department Team Leader and Department Administrator that each core content teacher has received feedback from 
colleagues regarding their planning and made necessary revisions at least once.  

Student ELA scores will be reviewed after the January Regents Examination administration to determine the 
percentage of students in Cohort 2020 earning a college readiness score of 75+ on the ELA Regents. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
The instrument of measure will be Regents scores and teacher team reports of progress.

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review,

Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

The Framework for Great Schools Report indicates the need to further enhance a supportive environment, especially in 
the areas of safety, classroom behavior, personal attention and support, and guidance. The 2016-2017 School Quality 
Guide report indicates 76% for Supportive Environment based on the NYC School Survey which is an improvement from 
the previous year. However, based on OORS data, the number of suspensions for 2017-2018 was 68 which was an 
increase from the previous year. In order for students to feel supported and challenged, additional instructional 
supports to promote student success and social and emotional well being will be offered. Staff will be trained in 
Restorative Practices, de-escalation strategies, and Positive Behavioral Supports. Student advisories will be put in place 
in specific grades and additional guidance support will be added to all school programs, including after school programs. 
Students will be offered opportunities for enrichment and incentive including mentoring, peer-mediation, campus 
activities, and trips.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly.

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Framework for Great Schools Report indicates a need to strengthen Family and Community Ties. By involving 
parents in post-secondary planning and assisting families in navigating college applications and financial aide planning, 
all constituents can be informed to make the best choice for each graduating student. In school year 2017-2018, 97% of 
graduating students completed their FAFSA and applied to college. More work needs to be done concerning informing 
parents and students of additional opportunities including financial aide, scholarships, and access to various colleges. By 
educating and exposing families to these opportunities, better, more inform choices can be made. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

data from the previous school year. In addition to school-wide assessments, including the NYC ELA Performance Task 
and programs such as Castle Learning, classrooms teachers use their own assessments for content and skills. Teachers 
work with Instructional Coaches to ensure assessments are aligned to content and skills. Data is shared and analyzed 
via Professional Learning and teacher team meetings. Teacher Leaders for each department and grade, meet regularly 
with administrators to monitor and review data. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program.

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Bronx Academy of Health Careers, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

Our school will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
Rationale: 
To aide students in developing their English Language skills through use of the target language. 
Students will learn social as well as academic language in a natural setting.  
  
US History - Certified Social Studies teachers will teach in Session 2 of the program at no cost to 
Title III. The ENL Teacher shall push in to provide language support. 
The After School Program will tentatively run from October  2018  - June 2019. 
Two content area teachers will offer instruction in Social Studies and Math to ELL and former 
ELL students only one day a week. The ENL teacher will provide additional language support in 
a team teaching model with each content area teacher. The sessions will run from 2:35 pm - 3:35 
pm on select  Wed and Thursdays for approximately 50 sessions. Also we will offer Lunch and 
Learn Program at no cost to Title III. In this program, students meet during their lunch, and work 
on school assignments and/or regents prep. 
LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION 
The language of instruction will be English with native language support when  permissible and 
needed. 
 NUMBER AND TYPES OF CERTIFIED TEACHERS 
The ELL Saturday Institute will consist of up to six teachers, six content area teachers, and 1 
dually certified ENL teacher. All instructors are fully licensed in their respective content areas 
which include ENL, Integrated Algebra, Trigonometry/Geometry, ELA, U.S. and Global 
History. The instructional mode will be a team-teaching approach; the ENL teacher and the 
science teacher will form a team in Session 1 and the ENL and Social Studies and Math teachers 
in Session 2. All ELLs including those in our target group are invited to participate in both 
sessions. 
The after school program will consist of one Social Studies Teacher, one Math Teacher, and one 
ENL Teacher 
TYPES OF MATERIALS 
After evaluating the results of the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT and Regents Exams, we concluded 
that our ELLs perform better in the areas of Listening/Speaking than they do in Reading/Writing 
and that they need intensive instruction in ELA, social studies,math, and science. In accordance 
with this data, we use texts consisting of themes that correspond to those in science and social 
studies for our ELL Saturday Institute. Additionally, we have purchased and have available 
Word-to-Word Bilingual Dictionaries for native language support. When available, bilingual 
English-Spanish materials will be provided.  As we have students who speak Chinese and 
Arabic, we select reading that reflect their culture. The English Regents program is designed 
specifically for high school ELLs and focus on developing reading, writing, listening skills for

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Regents essays. The NYSESLAT series develops these three skills as well as speaking skills for 
high school students. The Classroom Library is designed for high school ELLs who are 
struggling readers. Our rationale for choosing these resources is to acquaint our students with the 
format and requirements of both the ELA Regents and the NYSESLAT as well as to give 
adequate practice for both of these exams and to give our ELLs additional assistance in science 
and social studies to help them pass both their classes as well as state assessments in these areas. 
For our After School Program, we will utilize the services of online resources. Noredink.com, 
rewordify.com.   where students will open their own professional accounts. These accounts will 
be solely for ELLs and former ELLs to practice grammar and usage, proper sentence structure, 
and vocabulary skills. This program allows students to work on various activities to develop 
language proficiency skills, and to receive immediate feedback. This program will enhance 
students' writing across the curriculum.V

RATIONALE 
Outside of our regular school day, Title III content area teachers will engage in professional 
development opportunities that focus on the specific needs of our ELL students. Our rationale is 
that only through continued learning and training can we assure a high level of expertise for our 
teachers and enable them to keep their professional skills and knowledge up-to-date. Professional 
Development enables teachers and staff to keep up with the relevant knowledge and issues 
centered around English language learning.  
 
TEACHERS TO RECEIVE TRAINING 
 
All school personnel, including subject area teachers, teacher of ELLs, school secretary, speech 
teacher and guidance counselors will participate in in-house professional development 
throughout the academic year at no cost to Title III. The Professional  Development will be 
offered by the ENL Teacher and Dr. Helms. Specific training will be available outside of school 
hours. 
 
SCHEDULE AND DURATION 
 
Our professional development program will begin in September and run through June, 2019.

For parents that are involved in their child/children's education,  studies show that it fosters a 
better relationship between child, parent and the school community. Especially for ELL parents, 
such a relationship helps to do the following: 
- enhance their children's self-esteem 
- improve their children's academic achievement 
- improve parent-child relationships 
- help parents develop positive attitudes towards school 
- help parents to understand the American school system 
- Introduces early on the high expectations for students

calls that are automatically generated in Spanish and English. Students are also given handout 
notification in the preferred language to take home of upcoming events such as report card 
distribution, school closing, parent workshops, special events and trips. Moreover, flyers are 
mailed from our school to parents are invited to participate in Parent Association Meetings. 
Parents have access to their child's information through Pupil Path an online site used by the

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  
The assessment tool we use to assess the early literacy skills of our Spanish-speaking ELLs when needed  is the Spanish LAB. 
During the past several years we have not had any ELLs who required this test. In addition teachers use Curriculum Associates 
an online tool, Ed Performance, and various teacher created assessments. Use of these tools informs teachers of the students' 
reading and writing levels. Teachers then use this data to tailor instruction and find appropriate resources.

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We plan to meet with the language team and review the data. Then we will, as a group, discuss specific strategies to target 
weaknesses.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use the NYC Performance task. Once at the beginning of the school year as a baseline to measure reading comprehension 
and writing skills. After seeing areas in need of improvement, we then target those areas. We then give a similar assessment at 
the end of the school year to measure how student growth. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once we have obtained and analysed the data, we program those students who still are eligible for services for the at least the 
minimum amount of services or more to ensure they are getting the instructional help needed. Furthermore, we place 
students in our after school program which has one - one or small group instruction to receive additional support.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
  
N/A. We are a high school. 
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  
The data patterns across performance levels on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT and grades indicate that our ELLs perform far 
better in the Listening and Speaking sub tests than they do in the Reading and Writing sub tests. In addition, our students 
score hire on the Part Two - Argument writing on the NYS Regents Exam then they do on the Literary Analysis Essay.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our staff meets in weekly vertical meetings - grade team and content area. In these meeting we review student data. After 
review we align units and lessons to the needs of our students, while receiving feedback form many of the students teachers. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

  
Instruction for ELLs at the Bronx Academy of Health Careers is delivered through departmentalized ENL. Instruction is 
in English with home language support, emphasizing English language acquisition.  Our ENL teacher is certified in both 
TESOL and ELA, hence our ELLs will receive instruction through stand-alone and integrated ENL. In the integrated 
classes, instruction is given in a writing intensive class, Most of these classes are homogeneous - all students are in 
one grade, but have mixed proficiency levels. Because our ELL population is increasing, we hope to hire a second

certified ENL teacher. We will ensure in accordance with current Part 154 regulations that all ELLs and former ELLs up 
to 2 years after exiting ELL status will receive a minimum number of units (90) of integrated ENL. Few of our students 
are eligible for stand alone ENL. Those who are are serviced in a small class setting with students that are in either 
Entering or Emerging, and are primarily in the same grade.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

  The ENL Teacher and counselor sit down and review each ELLs program  to ensure that the mandated number of instructional 
minutes is provided according to proficiency levels of our students, we follow CR Part 154 guidelines as follows:         Entering 
(Beginning) - 540 minutes per week including 1 unit of study in ENL or 180 minutes; 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA; 1 unit 
in        stand-alone ENL or integrated ENL in a content area.         Emerging (Low Intermediate) - 360 minutes per week including 
.5 unit of study or 90 minutes in ENL; 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA; .5        unit of study in stand-alone or integrated ENL/content 
area.         Transitioning (Intermediate) - 180 minutes per week including .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA or 90 minutes; .5 unit of 
study in stand-        alone or integrated ENL/content area.         Expanding (Advanced) - 180 minutes per week including 1 unit 
of study in ENL/ELA or other content area.         Commanding (Proficient) - 90 minutes or .5 unit of study per week of 
integrated ENL in ELA/content area of other approved Former        ELL services for two additional years.    
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
      Core content is delivered through teachers certified in the content area that they are teaching.         As we offer ENL, the 
language of instruction is English. However, students are encouraged to use their L1 to ensure full understanding of ideas and 
concepts when needed.  We use word  walls, sentence starters and stems, writing templates, visuals, etc 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

  
        Since we do not have a transitional bilingual program, students are not evaluated in their home language throughout the 
year. Only during the ELL Identification process are students whose language is Spanish tested in their home language through 
the Spanish Lab. 
    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

 For SIFE Students -  we incorporate resources that reflect the background of the studentsFor Newcomers - we offer resources 
in the student's first language if available, use of bilingual glossary in classes, assign a peer with the same first language as a 
"buddy"For Developing  - we focus on increasing vocabulary, using manipulativeFor Long Term ELLs we focus on increasing the 
exposure and retention  to academic vocabulary using scaffolding techniques   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We use small groups, group activities, Bilingual support (both by staff and other students), visual clues, scaffolding, computer 
based programs, and several vocabulary games and strategies are employed in our classes.     
   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 Our ELL-SWDs have IEPs, and are therefore  placed in ICT (Integrated Co Teaching)  classes which has two certified teachers 
and allows them to be with non-ELL peers throughout the school day and to receive the same level of instruction. In these 
classes the teachers use the following instructional strategies:  differentiated instruction, scaffolding strategies, the SMART 
Board, and supplemental content area materials. As students achieve a certain level in content area subjects, special education 
teachers use flexible scheduling to place students in general education classes for those particular subjects. We ensure that 
our ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated by their IEPs including testing accommodations. These accommodations are 
implemented for classroom as well as city and state assessments.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
To ensure that our entire ELL population improves their linguistic and academic abilities so that they become English proficient 
and meet State standards, the Bronx Academy of Health Careers  offers both an English Language Learner (ELL)  Saturday 
Academy and an after-school program for our ELL population. All  of our ELL students, in grades 9 through 12, are invited and 
encouraged to attend both programs. The after-school program is a year-long program. The Saturday Academy runs from 
October 2018 through June 2019 during the hours of 9:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. and includes two sessions:  Session A from 9:00 
a.m. – 11:00 a.m. and Session B from 11:00 a.m. – 1:00 p.m. Classes offered are Integrated Algebra, Advanced Algebra and 
Trigonometry/Geometry, ELA, Chemistry, Living Environment,  ENL, and US and Global History. These classes are offered 
through either afterschool or Saturday (select courses are given afterschool and others are given on Saturday).The service 
providers are all fully licensed in their respective content areas. The instructional mode is a team-teaching approach; the ENL 
teacher and the science teacher  form a team in Session A and the ENL teacher and social studies teacher in Session B. All our 
ELL students are programmed for both sessions. Teachers give a pre-and post- unit assessment per unit of study. This data is 
collected, recorded and analyzed daily, weekly and monthly. Information from this data analysis is used weekly at our 
Professional Learning Team Meeting to collaboratively decide upon strategies that will be developed, refined and 
implemented. During the school day, teachers provide academic intervention by differentiating instruction. The language 
of  instruction is in English with native language support as needed by staff and/or peers.     
   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 
        We have no plans to implement a new program, but will work to ensure our current program continues to meet the 
needs of our students.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           65 

 

 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our instructional programs have high levels of rigor and support to ensure that all of our students, ELLs and non-ELLs, achieve 
high academic achievement. Daily reminders of the services offered are integrated into their ELA lessons with eh ENL/ELA 
teacher.  We ensure that they are afforded equal access to all school programs, including technology. We have a mobile 
computer cart that all students have access to for completing assignments and special projects. Our ELLs are encouraged to 
participate in our annual Cultural Fair, Career Day, and numerous activities offered on the campus, such a cooking classes and 
CPR and all other school assemblies and activities. All subgroups of ELLs are invited and encouraged to participate in our 
Saturday  Academy and after-school program.     
    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In addition to the regular classroom instructional materials that all our students use, our ELLs use Sadlier-Oxford's Grammar for 
Writing which includes a complete course in grammar, usage, and mechanics, with an emphasis on writing. We also utilize 
Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT for our ELL Saturday Academy. To further support ELLs, all classroom teachers use either a 
SMART Board or LCD screens as a teaching tool. Science, math, social studies, ELA and ENL teachers are able to use the 
Internet to access content area sites to support and enhance their lessons. All students have use of our computer lab to do 
research and complete projects on a whole class and individual basis. ELL students are encouraged to use the computer lab to 
practice and improve grammar/conventions usage at various sites designed specifically for ELLs. We also post links to 
dictionary and other sites designed specifically for ELLs.     
    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is provided in our Free Standing ENL Program through the use of bilingual dictionaries, staff members 
and students who speak Spanish and other languages. Furthermore, when using laptops, or the computers in the library 
students can have content translated for them.      
     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

As mentioned earlier, our ELL students use the same level of instructional materials as our non ELLs.  These instructional 
materials are aligned with grade and age levels.  In addition, we ensure that materials ordered specifically for our targeted 
intervention programs also correspond to our ELL's age and grade levels. The ENL coordinator reviews ELLs grades, meets with 
the ELL  content area teaches, and orders and gives supplies to said teachers that addresses areas of concern.      
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are one of six independent schools housed in the Evader Childs Campus. We have had building wide meetings with the 
building's other ELL teachers to discuss strategies and assessments.      
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 For the second time this year, we are also offering a Summer Bridge Program in Math and ELA taught by the ENL teacher and a 
bilingual math teacher to help prepare our students for the rigor of high school. The program is coordinated by AP McNeal and 
Principal Sanitago. In addition, prior to the beginning of the new school year in August, we offer an orientation  to all incoming 
students and their parents, ELLs included.   Staff members who are present provide an overview of the subjects that they 
teach.  We discuss ways the parents can assist their students with their homework.  Parent brochures explaining the various 
ELL programs are distributed to parents of ELLS.       

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           66 

 

 

 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The only language elective we offer in our school is Spanish.    
    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 All school personnel, including subject area teachers, teachers of ELLs, school secretaries, speech teacher and guidance 
counselors will participate in both on- and off-site professional development throughout the school year, delivered by staff 
and outside vendors who are certified ENL teachers/coordinators.     
    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  The Bronx Academy of Health Careers is committed to assisting all teachers in obtaining 15% of the the total numbers of 
hours required and 50% of total hours required for the ENL teacher in accordance with CR Part 154.2.  In addition, to our on 
site ELL professional development work shops, all teachers are encouraged to participate in off site staff development offered 
by the Office of English Language Learners, NYC Department of Education.  Our ELL Program Administrator maintains a record 
of ENL professional development hours completed by staff members towards satisfying the CR Part 154.2  mandate. 
Specifically she maintains a file consisting of agendas and attendance sheets from each in-house PD. If staff members attend 
an off-site ELL PD, they also present the ELL Program Administrator  with an agenda, proof of attendance such as written 
verification by the workshop presenter, and a description of the workshop. Our ELL Program Administrator maintains a roster 
of staff members and indicates hours completed for each ELL PD. * 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We will make every attempt to meet with the parent of each of our ELLs beyond the mandated parent orientation and parent-
teacher conferences. We will reach out to parents through letters in their preferred language and will ensure that we provide 
interpretation and translation by a qualified interpreter/translator as needed. At each meeting the ELL Program Administrator

and  Guidance Counselor will be present. We will record attendance at each meeting. The guidance counselor that will attend 
the meetings is bilijgual.  The parent coordinator that will also attend the meetings is also bilingual.   Since it is unlikely that we 
will be successful in getting the parent of every ELL to attend an annual individual meeting in person, we will also contact 
parents by phone and letters. Furthermore, we have invested in a phone based program Kinvolved that allows us to make 
outreach to parents and guardians n the parents preferred language.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents are called to participate in school raffles and workshops. Workshops include issues such as : fair housing policies, laws 
on sexual harassment as provided by the Human Rights Commission, and the college application process..

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dawn Santiago, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data used to assess the language preferences for both written and oral communication are taken from the 
the Parent's Preferred Language Form, the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS), and the RLAT (Report of 
Students Eligible for the NYSESLAT). In addition, parents are asked at orientation meetings and events throughout 
the year such as financial aid workshops, and parent teacher conferences in which language they prefer to receive 
information.

How do you plan to translate? 

Families  

The documents translated by our 
school include parent and student 
newsletters, e-mails, information on 
Skedula, school calendars, 
handbooks, automated phone calls 
etc. These documents are distributed 
to parents periodically throughout 
the year.  

The documents are distributed as 
needed. Documents are sent at least 
twice a month. 

Include procedures to ensure timely 
provision of translated documents to 

parents.  

The most common tool that we use 
for translation is Kinvolved. It 
translates automatically to the parents 
preferred home language. The 
messages can be sent by a teacher, 
administrator, or the parent 
coordinator.

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to 

provide interpretation service(s)?  

During the school year, staff will meet with 
parents at parent teacher conferences occur 
in the fall and spring. Parents will have 
access to all teachers, administration, and 
guidance counselors. Also, our Parent's 
Association meetings which occur monthly 
during the evening will host events such as 
immigration help, how to read transcripts, 
how to understand the 
curriculum/PupilPath/Skedula, college 
access, and financial aid awareness.  Parent 
Orientations are held as well as Parent 
Summits. During these meetings, various 
teachers, administration, and a senior 
guidance counselor are present.

Parent Teacher conferences are set 
for November and March. However, 
there are monthly Parent Association 
Meetings from September - June. 
Furthermore, we plane to have a 
Parent Summit, New Student 
Orientation, and other parent 
meetings. 

Interpretation is provided by staff 
that shares the same first home, 
language. If no one is available 
that shares the same home 
language, then an outside 
interpreter is requested.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Staff is sent a copy of the information regarding the Regulations, as well as the number and email address they can 
contact to request an interpreter. Furthermore a list of staff members and the languages they speak is made available 
so that one can ask a colleague for assistance if/when an interpretation is needed.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school utilizes the translation services of the DOE for flyers and posters. Furthermore, translated documents of 
items are downloaded from the DOE webpage and distributed to parents. Parents are given documents that contain 
links to the translation website, and are informed by teachers and staff at all parent attended events. Also, use of staff 
members, and Kinvolved is also used.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parent surveys are given to determine areas of growth and areas where additional supports are needed. We also 
gather feedback through in person communications at open school events and various un house activities which 
parents attend throughout the year.
