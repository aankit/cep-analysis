Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Millennium Brooklyn High School’s mission is to prepare students for college and career success through a rigorous 
academic program driven by project-based and experiential learning. MBHS is a screened, inclusive, diverse 
educational environment that emphasizes collaboration and student-centered learning.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The most recent High School Quality Snapshot reveals a diverse student population: 27% of students at MBHS identify 
as Hispanic, 31% identify as White, 25% identify as Black, and 9% identify as Asian. In addition, approximately 42% of 
students at MBHS qualify for free or reduced lunch. In order to best meet the needs of the 12% of students with 
special needs at MBHS, approximately one-half of classes on each grade level are co-taught, with a content specialist 
and special education teacher working side-by-side as co-lead teachers. MBHS pioneered the first high school Autism 
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Nest program in Brooklyn to provide academic and social supports in an inclusive setting for 
high functioning students on the autism spectrum. 

 

MBHS is well situated to demonstrate characteristics in alignment with the Framework for Great Schools. The most 
recent NYC School Survey indicated that 100% of teachers at MBHS feel that the school creates an atmosphere that 
encourages students to work towards a college degree, and 97% of teachers say that teachers at this school work 
closely with families to meet students' needs. Resources including money and time professional development are 
devoted to creating substantial opportunities for teacher collaboration, including programmed co-planning sessions, 
department inquiry team meetings, peer inter-visitations, and after school meetings for our growing special education 
team. In response to Quality Review feedback around crafting consistently rigorous, student-centered instruction, the 
professional development team implemented a new instructional focus around lesson planning in 2016-17, including 
peer reviews of lesson plans and a revised MBHS lesson planning template. The instructional focus around rigorous 
tasks continued in 2017-18, and the 2018-19 instructional focus will be around providing meaningful feedback to 
students. We have also implemented greater structure to our parent communication through the use of School 
Messenger, which allows us to reach out to MBHS families or particular cohorts through electronically executed 
telephone calls, text messages, and emails. This system allows for personalization so parents can be electronically 
informed of specific days that their children were absent or late, as well as specific enrichment opportunities that 
would benefit their children. 

 

At MBHS there is a strong emphasis placed on literacy skills, research, and critical thinking across all grade levels and 
subject areas. Students are required to take four years of Research, beginning with Quantitative in 9th grade and 
Qualitative Research in 10th grade and ending with intensive, content-focused electives such as Statistics, Sociology, 
and Psychology in 11th and 12th grade. Students who excel academically have the option of taking one of ten 
Advanced Placement courses offered at MBHS: AP Language and Composition, AP Literature and Composition, AP 
United States History, AP Environmental Science, AP Biology, AP Chemistry, AP Computer Science, AP Spanish, AP 
French, or AP Psychology. Students can also take a number of elective courses at MBHS, and apply to take College 
Now classes. 

 

Students can also take advantage of community based partnerships that support both our in-school instruction as well 
as off-site opportunities for our learners. Seniors were matched with mentors at agencies ranging from local hospitals 
to law offices to PS 321, where they gain valuable real-world experience and earn high school credit. Students can 
also take advantage of partnerships that MBHS has fostered with the following organizations: the National 
Consortium for STEM Secondary Schools (NCSSS), Brooklyn College, NYU-Polytechnic School of Engineering, Long 
Island University, Project Lead the Way, Beauty and Joy of Computing, BRIC Arts, the Museum of Natural History, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Generation On, Methodist Hospital, and Wyckoff Hospital. Due in large part to the work of our energetic staff, rich 
course sequence, and support of parents and aforementioned community groups, the graduation rate at MBHS in 
2017-18 was 100%, with approximately 85% graduating "college ready". 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

MBHS was on of the first high schools in New York City to implement an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Nest 
program for high-functioning students on the autism spectrum. Currently, we have approximately 35 students in our 
ASD Nest program. These students are taught in fully inclusive ICT classrooms for all of their content courses, Physical 
Education, and Art. In addition, they receive targeted instruction around executive functioning, speech, and college 
readiness, and receive therapeutic support via are three full-time social workers, ASD Nest coach, and ASD Nest break 
room. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Moving forward, our task is to continue to find ways to engage students in rigorous learning activities, both at school 
and through enrichment activities that often extend beyond the walls of the classroom. This goal is based on the high 
percentage of students demonstrating proficiency in their coursework, as opposed to mastery on Regent's exams, the 
number of students enrolling in one of our 10 Advanced Placement courses, and student assessment data from 
teacher-created benchmarks exams. Ensuring broad access to AP courses, emphasizing rigorous tasks across all 
subjects and courses, sharpening structures of support to improve the instructional practice of both new and veteran 
teachers, increasing the number of students who graduate "college ready", finding innovative ways to elicit parent 
and guardian feedback, and honing both the college and internship process remain goals for the upcoming 2018-19 
school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Strengths: 

 

In 2017-18, MBHS had a graduation rate of 100%, with approximately 85% of students graduating "college 
ready".  

  A comprehensive review of our students’ Regent’s data reveals that the vast majority of students are able to 

successfully pass the Common Core English, Common Core Algebra, Algebra II, Living Environment, Global 
History, and U.S. History Regents’ exams (pass rates range from a 93% to a 100% for these exams). 

  Each year, MBHS conducts a summer retreat during the last week of August. Teachers review and revise 

curriculum maps and syllabi, craft common baseline and benchmark assessments, review student data around 
lexile reading levels, identify goals around our instructional focus on rigorous tasks, and set instructional goals 
for the upcoming school year. 

  Every year, MBHS conducts a well-attended Curriculum Night for parents and guardians in order to inform 
community members of our rigorous course sequence and students’ progress toward regents’ and college 
readiness. 

  Every faculty member at MBHS participates in a weekly faculty meeting to share student data on baseline and 

benchmark assessments, engage in faculty-lead instructional workshops, and norm expectations around 
rigorous tasks, differentiation, and co-teaching models. 

  Every teacher at MBHS has a weekly department meeting built-in to their schedule, during which they 

collaborate with both their co-teacher(s) and department members to analyze data, craft differentiated 
activities, and norm assessment expectations. 

  MBHS has a school-wide inquiry calendar. Every department creates common baseline and benchmark 

assessments around high-leverage skills and regents’ readiness. These assessments are given each quarter, 
after which department teams meet to analyze student data, update departmental data trackers, identify 
gaps in student proficiency levels, and craft differentiated instruction to address said proficiency gaps. 

  Within departments, teachers conduct quarterly inter-visitations to observe best co-teaching practices and 

inquiry-driven instruction. 

  During the 1st quarter, MBHS conducts an annual needs assessment regarding teachers’ professional growth 

and facilitated a number of instructional workshops during the Election Day professional development 
session. Teachers create and lead workshops around identified instructional needs to target individual 
educator’s areas of instructional growth within their given subject areas. 

  MBHS utilizes the advisory model, part of which includes helping each student set individual academic goals 

and conduct weekly academic check-ins to monitor and assess progress. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

Challenges: 

  While a high percentage of students are successfully passing the Common Core Algebra I and Common Core 

English Regents’ exams, data reveals that a small percentage of students are not meeting the CUNY cut off 
score on these exams. Furthermore, students’ scores on the historically more challenging regent's exams 
drop: the number of students passing the Chemistry and Physics regent's exams ranges from 70% to 80%. This 
data suggests that students may not be developing the higher-order reading, writing, and problem solving 
skills necessary to excel on these regent's exams and move students toward college readiness. 

  Quarterly benchmark assessments indicate that approximately 10-15% of students across subject areas 

struggle to demonstrate proficiency on reading, writing, and problem solving tasks. This percentage is even 
higher with regard to regents readiness on the historically more challenging exams such as Physics and 
Algebra II. The need to engage these students with rigorous learning activities in order to help them address 
gaps in their proficiency levels, and to align aims and assessments, is therefore evident. 

  According to the most recent School Quality Guide, only 72% of students feel they are challenged in their 

classes. This suggests more of a need to design engaging, complex learning activities that are differentiated to 
meet the needs of all of our learners. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, 90% of 9th and 10th grade students will demonstrate lexile reading proficiency growth of at least 50 
points, and 80% of students in grades 9 and 10 will demonstrate lexile reading proficiency growth exceeding one year as 
captured by their Achieve3000 level set exams.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Using the program Achieve3000, all 9th and 10th grade students 
at MBHS will sit for a baseline reading assessment in September 
2018. Lexile reading level scores will be given to each student, 
and Humanities teacher teams will identify students who are “Far 
Below”, “Approaching”, "Meets", or "Exceeding" grade level 
regarding lexile reading levels. Students who are “Far Below” or 
“Approaching” lexile reading levels will receive extra, targeted 
reading interventions twice a month, while all students will 
receive regular reading instruction. The goal is for 80% students 
to improve their lexile reading score by 80 points (or one grade 
level), and for every student to improve by at least 50 points, 
between September 2018 and June 2019.  English Language 
Learners and students with IEPs will be given targeted support 
during office hours if their data indicates they are falling short of 
the desired lexile growth score 

In January 2019, all students who were identified as "Far Below" 
or "Approaching" will have their lexile reading proficiency levels 
reviewed. Humanities teacher teams, our ELL Coordinator, our 
Special Education team, and the administration will adjust and 
revise AIS plans for this group of students if they have not 
increased their lexile reading levels by at least 40 points. Office 
horus will be used to provide targeted to support to our ELL 
students and / or students with an IEP. 

In May of 2019, all 9th and 10th graders will sit for a final 
Achieve3000 assessment to determine their lexile reading score.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Achieve 3000 is a web based program that students use both at school and at home, giving families the opportunity to 
track their child's progress and view their reading assignments in real time. Beginning in September, 9th and 10th 
grade advisors will conduct outreach to families around navigating the Achieve 3000 program. During the MBHS 
Curriculum Night in September, the Humanities Department and administration team will also provide an overview 
for parents and guardians as to how to use the program to track their child's reading growth and provide feedback 
around their reading assignments. Grade teams will also provide support vying tracking the progress and completion 
rates of students who are identified as reading "Far Below" grade level. During Parent Teacher Conferences in 
November of 2018 and March of 2019, 9th and 10th grade Humanities teachers will provide quantitative and 
qualitative feedback around reading proficiency levels and targeted reading strategies. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
The vision of MBHS relies on collaboration, and as such the administrative team will work closely with teacher teams 
and department coordinators during weekly department and grade team meetings to support and facilitate goals 
around rigorous instruction. The Humanities Department Chairs (Daniel Pontillo and Addie Male) will work directly 
with both teachers and their students to identify and support best practices regarding literacy instruction, as well as 
working directly with Achieve3000 consultants. Teacher teams will also utilize the web-based programs Achieve3000 
and Teachboost, with consultants from these respective companies meeting with teachers and administrators on an 
as-needed basis throughout the school year.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By January of 2019, 9th and 10th grade students will have completed their baseline Achieve3000 Level Set exam and 
participated in targeted reading lessons on a bi-weekly basis beginning in September (more often for students 
identified as reading "Far Below" or "Approaching" grade level). The Humanities Department, working in conjunction 
with the administration, will meet during the January Regents’ week to identify students still struggling to 
demonstrate reading proficiency on departmental benchmarks and/or lexile reading level assessments (i.e. students 
who did not add 40 points to their lexile reading score). Additional instructional interventions (i.e. running records, 
mandated office hours, etc) will be implemented at this time to help these students demonstrate proficiency. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Two instruments will be used to assess students' progress regarding their lexile reading levels: the primary tool will be 
Achieve3000 lexile reading assessment data, and the secondary tool will be teacher-created benchmark assessments. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The most recent NYC School Survey shows that 93% of MBHS students of students say that they are learning a lot in 
their classes at their school to prepare them for the next level or grade, and 94% of teachers stated that students feel 
challenged. That said, the NYC School Survey also noted that only 88% of students feel that their teachers use 
examples of students’ different cultures/backgrounds/families in their lessons to make learning more meaningful and 
culturally relevant, and 82% of students say that their teachers make the lessons relevant to their everyday life 
experiences. With a diverse student body and strong emphasis on inclusively and collaboration, a priority for MBHS in 
the 2018-19 school year regarding creating a supportive environment is to implement a culturally relevant pedagogy 
component to our professional development cycle to help teachers build their cultural competency and infuse their 
curricula with culturally relevant material.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
On the 2018-19 NYC School Survey, 90% of students will respond favorably when asked if teachers use examples of 
their culture / background / family to make their learning more meaningful and culturally relevant.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In June of 2018, five faculty members from our Seeking 
Educational Equity and Diversity (SEED) will attend a week-long 
professional development training arounf culturally relevant 
education. This session will provide a framework and curricula 
for training teachers to be more culturally responsive in their 
classroom interactions and instructional planning. After the 
training, Ms. Shinerock and Ms. Beato will meet with 
administration to calendar out a series of professional 
development workshops for the MBHS faculty, all of which will 
take place during Monday faculty meetings in the 2018-19 school 
year. 

Beginning at our Summer Retreat in August of 2018, and using 
the curricula provided by SEED, 6 professional development 
workshops around culturally responsive pedagogy will be 
planned out calendared out for the 2018-19 school year. The 
purpose of each SEED PD will be to provide resources and 
strategies for infusing culturally relevant and responsive 
educational practices into curricula and classroom interactions 
with our student body.  

In January, the SEED team and administration with lead a 
reflection session with two groups: the MBHS faculty, and 
student representatives from our Social Justice Club. The 
purpose of the reflection is to understand the ways in which our 
SEED workshops have benefited culturally responsive teaching 
and learning at MBHS, and to identify areas of weakness in the 
workshops and/or possible adjustments to the sessions. Any 
changes to the SEED workshops with then be implemented 
between February 2019 and the end of the school year 

In June, the SEED team, administration, MBHS faculty, and Social 
Justice Club students members will hold a final reflection to 
identify the ways in which the SEED workshops benefited 
teaching and learning, as well as to map out next steps regarding 
continuing to build a culturally responsive environment at MBHS. 
In addition, the SEED team and administrative teams will analyze 
NYC Student Survey data in the summer of 2019 to identify if 
more students responded favorably regarding questions 
pertaining to cultural competency.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
To supplement the work we will conduct around our goal to build a more culturally responsive community at MBHS, 
parents will be asked to to support this goal in number of ways. In June of 2018, the Parent Association will provide 
funding for the SEED professional development training. Beginning in September 20178 the MBHS SLT will meet 
monthly to reflect on the work of the SEED team and offer suggestions for revisions to the SEED workshops. Parents 
and guardians will be asked to volunteer their time at events such as the MBHS Peace and Diversity week in April, 
which serves to celebrate our diverse school community and educate one another to build cultural competency. 
Finally, parents and guardians will eb encouraged to complete the NYC School Survey to help the SEED and 
administrative team understand their beliefs around how well the school is implementing a culturally responsive 
school community. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
The SEED team at MBHS, comprised of teachers and social workers, will be at the front and center of this work. Two 
members of this team will receive a week-long training from SEED, and turn-key the information and resources in 
weekly SEED meetings. The Parent Association will provide funding for the SEED training, and the administrative team 
will provide time and space for the workshops by identifying 6 faculty meetings for the SEED team to implement SEED 
workshops.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on our Measure of Teacher Practice (MOTP) data for the 2018-19 school year, only 1 teacher received an MOTP 
rating of Developing, and no teacher was rated Ineffective. This data suggests that we have a capable and engaged 
faculty that would benefit from observing each other to share best practices. 

 

Our most recent Quality Review notes that “the culture of professional collaboration results in school-wide 
instructional coherence, increased student outcomes for all learners, and teachers playing an integral role in key 
decisions.” In addition, 90% of teachers responded positively on the NYC School Survey to the question about 
teachers designing instructional programs together. Clearly, the structures for meaningful collaboration are in place, 
and MBHS has a staff willing to work with and learn from one another. That said, there is still room for growth. Only 
76% of students say that they learn a lot from feedback on their work, and 10% of MBHS students indicated that they 
did not know what their teacher wanted them to learn in class Focusing more intentionally on building our collectively 
pedagogical practice will help create more meaningful learning opportunities for students at MBHS. 

Now entering our 8th year, we have been able to create teams to build capacity around both professional and student 
learning. Over the past 7 years we have created the following teams: school-wide cabinet, administrative cabinet, 
special education committee, and a professional development committee consisting of each department chair. Time 
is built into each faculty members schedule to meet in teams, develop school-wide initiatives, and establish a culture 
for student growth and achievement. This work has been key in tracking student data, identifying and supporting 
students in the academic bottom-third in each grade, norming our professional practice around the common 
language of both the Danielson Framework and the Common Core, and developing curriculum and assessments. 
These structures have also fostered a community of collaborative teachers who are consistently engaged in 
professional development. One structure we have used to support teacher collaboration and learning thus far is 
teacher-led workshops during faculty professional development. This year our instructional focus will continue to be 
rooted in providing meaningful feedback for students in order to move them to next level of proficiency.  

A summary of our current structures to foster collaborative teachers: 

  Department Chair Meetings: Weekly meetings aimed at norming best pedagogical practices, analyzing 

 

rigorous task protocols, and conducting work around effectively leading teacher teams.  
Inquiry Teams: Teachers and administrators use data to provide targeted, differentiated support for students 
across all departments and grade levels. 

  Grade Team Meetings: Every teacher at MBHS participates in a weekly grade team meeting, during which 

team members: conduct outreach with parents and guardians regarding each student’s academic standing, 
identify students who are struggling academically across multiple subject areas, and craft action plans and 
differentiated instruction to help address gaps in proficiency.

  Department Planning Teams: Built in planning time for teachers in each department to engage in curriculum 

development; and to collaborate on the sharing of and reflection on instructional practice. 

  Professional Development Committee: Teachers and administrators collaborate to plan and coordinate 

 

 

 

meaningful professional development around instruction, student engagement, and assessment based on 
needs assessment, Common Core Learning Standards and the Danielson framework. 
Faculty Meetings Professional Development Cycle: Weekly staff meetings in which faculty hone their 
instructional practice through participation in workshops on the Common Core Learning Standards, Charlotte 
Danielson’s A Framework for Teaching , and project-based learning in inclusive classroom environments. 
School-wide Cabinet Meeting: Faculty representatives meet weekly to identify and provide support around 
issues of safety and respect for all MBHS systems and structures, the socio-emotional developments that 
impact the MBHS community, and to calendar events to support and enhance school culture. 
Special Education Leadership Team: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Nest Leadership Team : Principal and AP 
Special Education meet monthly with NYU consultants to support, reflect on and document the facets of the 
innovative program to provide inclusive education and social supports for students on the autism spectrum. 

  Academic Intervention Services (AIS): Teachers and administrators use data to provide targeted, 

 

 

differentiated support around specific skill sets to small groups of students. 
Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) Model: Provides additional in-class support to students, providing structure for 
case-conferencing students to provide effective strategies for supporting the whole child academically, 
behaviorally, and socio-emotionally. 
Seeking Educational Equity and Diversity (SEED) Team: Meets weekly to craft workshops around infusing 
curricula with more culturally relevant learning opportunities. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By June of 2019, 80% teachers’ MOTP ratings on Domain 3 of the Danielson Framework will increase one proficiency 
level (example: "Developing" to "Effective") on a given component in Domain 3.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

 

In order to encourage shared best practices, department chairs 
and the administrative team will create a calendar for quarterly 
inter-visitations; one inter-visitation will be conducted within 
departments, one on grade level, one around a specific 
pedagogical skill, and one across all grade levels. A pervasive 
focus will be on analyzing the quality and type of feedback 
given by teachers to students on the various tasks students 
engage with during a given lesson, specifically focusing on the 
teaching traits outlines in Danielson Framework Components 
3b: using questioning and discussion techniques, 3c: engaging 
students in learning, and 3d: using assessment in instruction. 
Time for reflection will be allocated during Monday faculty 
meetings, with a protocol to help teachers guide their low-
inference observation feedback around Danielson Component 
3b, 3c, and/or 3d.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
While our goal is rooted in teacher's classroom instruction and inter-visitation observation, we will elicit parent 
feedback in number of ways. In September of 2018, we will gather parent and guardian feedback around curricula and 
instructional practices at MBHS, and use said feedback to help guide or department meetings and inter-visitations. In 
addition, Parent and Guardian feedback on the 2017-18 NYC School Survey around the efficacy of instructional 
practice at MBHS will be analyzed to determine areas for growth related to Danielson Components 3a, 3b, and 3c. 
Finally, the MBHS SLT meets monthly, and a primary purpose of these meetings is to discuss our instructional focus on 
rigorous tasks and ways to improve teaching and learning in the school.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Inquiry Teams : Teachers and administrators meet weekly by 
department to use data to provide targeted, differentiated 
support for students across all departments and grade levels. 
Academic Intervention support is designed based on this data, 
which is communicated to students and parents to support 
student growth. Academically at-risk students are provided 
additional academic supports, and their progress is monitored to 
ensure growth toward regents readiness. ELL Coordinator and AP 
of Special Education will push into inquiry teams to provide 
targeted strategies around how to best support ELLs and 
students with IEPs 

Grade Teams : Teachers and administrators use qualitative and 
quantitative assessment data to identify and provide support for 
students through a holistic approach and the use of weekly 
surveys, assessment data, and instructional, social, and 
behavioral intervention plans. Time is built into the weekly 
meetings for parent outreach and scheduling parent meetings. 

Department Planning Teams: MBHS provides built in planning 
time for teachers in each department to engage in curriculum 
development and to collaborate and reflect on instructional 
practice. This information is organized into parent presentations 
for Curriculum Night and PA meetings focusing on common 
curriculum. Administrators help facilitate these meetings to 
ensure that the MBHS instructional focus (rigorous tasks) is a 
priority when teachers plan lessons. 

Professional Development Committee: Teachers and 
administrators collaborate to plan and coordinate meaningful 
professional development around instruction, student 
engagement, and assessment based on needs assessment, 
Common Core Learning Standards and the Danielson framework,

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
During the August 2018 MBHS Summer Retreat, the instructional focus plan around rigorous tasks will be shared with 
teachers, departments will meet to develop protocols around sharing best practices and revise curriculum maps using 
administrative feedback, and all teachers will use Teachboost to commit to personal professional and instructional 
goals rooted in the Danielson Framework. Beginning in September of 2018 and continuing throughout the school 
year, MBHS administrators will complete classroom observations using the Danielson Framework and Teachboost and 
provide specific feedback around each of the eight Danielson competencies related to the Measure of Teacher 
Practice. In person feedback sessions are conducted with each teacher on an on-going and as needed basis to clarify 
areas of instructional need and growth. In addition, inter-visitations and non-evaluative observations will be

conducted as needed by department chairs to support instructional growth around crafting rigorous tasks for all 
teachers. In November, Election Day professional development will center around crafting student-centered, 
cognitively engaging learning activities. In January, department chairs will provide feedback to the administrative 
team regarding ways to better support teachers in the creation of rigorous tasks, and the professional development 
calendar will adjusted to meet these needs. In June 2019, Summative End-of-the-Year conferences will be conducted 
with each teacher to analyze instructional progress and identify next steps regarding each teacher’s growth. In 
addition, teacher teams will analyze benchmark data to determine students’ skill and content acquisition and identify 
gaps in proficiency that can be addressed via targeted instruction., and review curriculum maps to determine areas to 
strengthen our course sequence. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

  According to our most recent School Quality Snapshot, 92% of parents say that teachers work closely with 

them to meet their child's needs. , and 94% of parents say that school staff regularly communicate with them 
about how parents can help their child learn . 

  According to the most recent NYC School Survey 96% or parents responded "Strongly Agree" or "Agree" when 
asked if the principal/school leader at this school promotes family and community involvement in the school.  
  MBHS has created numerous partnerships to further our mission. Our collaboration with NYU-Talon School of 

Engineering allows students to support university professors in their research during the summer months. 
NYU has provided MBHS with a graduate student to co-plan with our Introduction to Engineering teacher, in 
addition to starting a Lego Robotics Team, approximately 20% of which is comprised of students on the 
autism spectrum. Partnerships with three Brooklyn Hospitals (NY Methodist Hospital, Brooklyn Hospital and 
Wyckoff Community Heights Medical Center) have allowed us to provide real world human services exposure 
alongside academic research to students interested in health care fields. Our continued work with Long Island 
University includes the operation of an after-school writing center founded by faculty and graduate students 
of the university. Students have benefited from several paid internships in for-profit firms through our work 
with two notable not-for-profit organizations: PENCIL and Futures and Options. Students have presented 
research around environmental studies at Grinnell College and participatory action research through the 
National Council of Teachers of English. Additional academic partnerships include course offerings from 
Brooklyn College and St. Joseph’s College. MBHS will also work with the Beauty and Joy of Computing 
organization to aid us with our A.P. Computer Science course.  

  Through the Department of Education’s Division of Specialize Instruction and Students Support, MBHS has 

served over 25% of our students with disabilities with paid community based placements. This and other 
opportunities include supporting the Prospect Park Conservancy, NY Methodist Hospital, and Habitat for 
Humanity, among other notable community-based organizations. 

  Through a variety of systems, MBHS maintains continuous contact with our parent community. These systems 

include weekly advisory announcement newsletters, small advisory groups in which advisors serve as the 
principal point of family contact, an online grading system (PupilPath) that allows for near real time feedback 
on academic progress, School Messenger which allows us to contact parents regarding student's absences or 
upcoming events, and a parent Gmail group. Our special education program entails additional family 
engagement, including monthly meetings for parents of students with high functioning autism, periodic 
conferences with case managers (teachers serving as point persons for each child with an IEP), and annual IEP 
meetings.

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

By June of 2019, MBHS Administrators and/or faculty will have formally reached out once per month to communicate 
with parents and guardians in the form of curriculum nights, parent-teacher conferences, progress and report cards, 
parent workshops, and career days, which will result in a 95% rating on, “encouraging feedback from 
parents/guardians", as measured by the NYC School Survey.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and structures needed 
to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

Significant outreach will be made to the parent community 
through the following outlets to convey the importance of off-
site experiences including enhanced social development and 
greater academic persistence: Meetings of the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association and parents of students in 
our ASD Nest program; Electronic outreach including email 
blasts and web postings; a grade-by-grade assessment calendar 
posted on the MBHS website and updated weekly by Teachers, 
school announcements via School Messenger  

Parent-Teacher Conferences will be student-led and structured 
so as to allow parents and guardians to provide feedback to 
each teacher. Sign-Up Genius, an online sign up system, will be 
used to streamline the organization of PTCs. School Messenger 
will be used to advertise PTCs. The first PTC in September will be 
a Curriculum Night, helping families understand the curriculum 
and related programs at MBHS. Our ELL Coordinator will 
conduct a parent workshop around how we support our ELLs, 
and our ASD Nest team will conduct quarterly parent workshops 
around supporting students with IEPs and/or high-functioning 
autism. 

Students with disabilities will be provided with additional 
support around community service and internship selection, 
including being accompanied by social workers, additional 
parent communication, pre- and post-event lessons, and the 
support of the Transition Opportunity Program as well as 
Summer Youth Employment through the Division of Specialize 
Instruction and Students Support. In addition, a total of 5 parent 
workshops will be held for parents in of students in our ASD 
Nest program, with a focus of helping parents and guardians 
support their children as they progress through high school  

In June, the SLT and administrative team will review the formal 
communication that took place with families during the 2017-18 
school year to ensure that MBHS reached out to families once 
per month and brainstorm ways to improve outreach. NYC 
School Survey data will also be analyzed when available.

for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of 
this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. 
Millennium Brooklyn High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
Millennium Brooklyn High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the 
proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and 
improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

Coordinator will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the 
school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Technology 
Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the 
central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use Achieve 3000 to assess students' reading skills by the measurement of their lexile scores. In addition, students' reading 
comprehension and writing skills are assessed through MBHS teacher designed baseline and benchmark assessments that are 
given four times yearly. This data shows that ELLs reading lexiles are usually below grade level. It also reveals that their reading 
comprehension skills as well as writing skills are below grade level. Our school uses this data to drive our instructional plans for 
these students. We specifically design lessons to advance their reading lexiles to grade level. We also design mini-lessons on 
reading strategies and hold small group writing workshops.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We use baseline and benchmark data every marking period to determine appropriate individual ELL interventions. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Students' results from both the January and June Regents help us to determine whether students have made Adequate Yearly 
Progress. Additionally, we use the data from Achieve 3000 reading activities to measure students' reading and writing 
progress. Finally we draw upon their Progress Reports, Report Card grades, as well as informal classroom observations.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers discuss appropriate interventions twice weekly, in grade team and department meetings. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns from the NYSITELL reveal that all of our students, grades 9-12, start MBHS at a Commanding Level or near 
Commanding Level. Those students who are Expanding upon starting, improve one proficiency level within a year of being at 
MBHS, as relefected by the NYSESLAT data.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our findings are disseminated to teachers twice weekly, both in departments and by grade. Teachers then discuss appropriate 
adjustments and revisions to the programs in place. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ELL students are integrated into mainstream classrooms, and they generally travel by grade section, except for 
Foreign Language, and Math, when sections are sometimes split up and/or combined. Regardless, all sections and 
classes at MBHS are always heterogeneous. 
Our Freestanding ENL Program is structured such that students receive services integrated into their core content 
classes, including Social Studies (Econ, US History, Humanities) and English (Journalism, Humanities). The teachers 
currently delivering service are Jason Wallin, Emily Goldsmith, Lindsay Horgan and Samantha Thomson. These 
teachers push-in to the core content classroom to collaborate with the content area teacher and provide integrated 
English support. As per the CR Part 154.2, commanding students are receiving 90 minutes a week of integrated 
services, while our one transitioning level student receives 180 minutes weekly. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

At the beginning of the school year, and every time a new student is enrolled throughout the year, Samantha Thomson 
communicates with the school Programmer, Nigel Franklyn, to ensure that he is aware of the ELL population, and that they 
schedule the students for the mandated number of hours weekly, as per the CR Part 154 requirements. This is programmed 
into STARS. At present, all of our students except for one are of "commanding" proficiency. The other student is 
"transitioning." Commanding students are receiving 90 minutes a week of integrated services, as per the CR Part 154.2, while 
the "transitioning" student is receiving 180 minutes of integrated services.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   At present, we are only using one instructional mode: Freestanding ENL. ELL Teachers (including Jason Wallin, Emily 
Goldsmith, Samantha Thomson and Lindsay Horgan) provide content area supports through accommodations like "Words of 
the Week," graphic organizers with sentence starters, and PPT notes. We use Socratic Seminars as well as Writing Workshops 
to work with individual students to set SMART goals and give them strategies to improve their work. ESL teachers provide 
content area supports by checking-in with students as they complete normal classwork. When necessary, the ESL teacher 
provides Tier 3 supports to students for reading (such as reading strategies, vocabulary building) and writing (argumentative 
writing, sentence structures, modeled writing, scaffolded worksheets). In terms of speaking & listening, ESL teachers support 
ELLs by one-on-one practice for class presentations, preparation for Socratic Seminar, and other student-led discussion 
activities, such as Speed Dating, Popcorn Talk, etc ….  These methods are in line with CCLS since they support students in 
accomplishing objectives and activities of lessons aligned to the CCLS. At MBHS, it is requirement that all curricular maps and 
subsequent lessons and coursework be aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards to foster students' language 
development across the four skills. Therefore, as a support to the content area teacher, the ESL teachers' methods are 
automatically aligned.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Since our school's existence, our students have all been "commanding" so we do not test them in their Home Language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

b) We have one student in this level, who is of "transitioning" proficiency. As previously explained, this student is receiving 
integrated service in her content area classes, as part of our Freestanding ENL Program. We do not offer any other Program at 
this time. The teachers provide differentiated supports through accommodations like "Words of the Week," graphic organizers 
with sentence starters, and powerpoint notes. The teachers use Socratic Seminars as well as Writing Workshops to work with 
individual students to set SMART goals and give them strategies to improve their work. ESL teachers provide content area 
supports by checking-in with students as they complete normal classwork. When necessary, the ESL teacher provides Tier 3

e) The other 10 ELLs are "commanding." In other words they are Former ELLs that are receiving two years of service after 
exiting ELL status. As previously explained, these students are receiving integrated services in the content area classes, as part 
of our Freestanding ENL Program. These students are supported by their ESL Teachers (Horgan, Wallin, Goldsmith and 
Thomson) in a variety of ways. The needs of each student are determined at the beginning of the school year, and discussed 
weekly in Grade Team as well as Department Meetings. Teachers share best practices and upon request, Ms. Thomson also 
models differentiated instruction. ESL Teachers (including Jason Wallin, Emily Goldsmith, Samantha Thomson and Lindsay 
Horgan) provide English supports across content areas through accommodations like "Words of the Week," graphic organizers 
with sentence starters, and powerpoint notes. We use Socratic Seminars as well as Writing Workshops to work with individual 
students to set SMART goals and give them strategies to improve their work. ESL teachers provide content area supports by 
checking-in with students as they complete normal classwork. When necessary, the ESL teacher provides Tier 3 supports to 
students for reading (such as reading strategies) and writing (sentence structures, modeled writing, scaffolded worksheets). In 
terms of speaking & listening, ESL teachers support ELLs by one-on-one practice for class presentations, preparation for 
Socratic Seminar, and other student-led discussion activities, such as Speed Dating, Popcorn Talk, etc ….  These methods are in 
line with CCLS since they support students in accomplishing objectives and activities of lessons aligned to the CCLS. At MBHS, it 
is requirement that all curricular maps and subsequent lessons and coursework be aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards to foster students' language development across the four skills. Therefore, as a support to the content area teacher, 
the ESL teachers' methods are automatically aligned.  
For both groups b) & e), our school follows the testing accommodations outlined below: 
Time extension (all exams): We extend the test time for ELL students on NYS ELA and content-area assessments and on 
Regents examinations. Principals consult with teachers to determine appropriate time extensions, which are most commonly 
given as  "time and a half" (the required testing time plus half that amount). However, there are no time limits.  
• Separate location (all exams): NYS assessments are administered to ELLs individually or in small groups in a separate 
location.  
• Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries: ELLs may use bilingual glossaries when taking State examinations in all subjects 
except languages other than English exams (LOTE). The bilingual dictionaries and glossaries may provide only direct one-to-one 
translations of words. Bilingual dictionaries and/or glossaries that provide definitions or explanations are not permitted. 
Bilingual glossaries in the content areas are available for downloading.  
• Simultaneous use of English and alternative language editions are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. For 
state examinations for which SED provides written translations, ELLs may use both English and an alternative language edition 
of the test simultaneously. However, they should be instructed to record all of their responses in only one language. The 
alternative language edition used by the student should be so indicated on the student's answer sheet.  
• Oral translations for low incidence languages are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. Schools may provide 
ELL students with an oral translation of a state examination when there is no translated edition provided by SED. All 
translations must be oral, direct translations of the English editions. Written translations are not allowed. No clarifications or 
explanations may be provided. Translators should receive copies of the English edition of the tests one hour prior to 
administration.  
• Writing responses in the home language are not allowed for English Language Arts examinations. ELL students making use of 
alternative language editions or of oral translations of state examinations may write their responses to the open-ended 
question in their home languages. Scoring the tests is the responsibility of the school. 
We reserve the right for students to appeal a score of 62-64 on up to two of the required Regents examinations provided that 
they pass the remaining Regents exams with a 65 or above and meet the additional criteria. Students can earn a Regents 
diploma if they successfully appeal one exam score of 62-64 and have a score of 65 of above on the four remaining exams or; 
students can earn a local diploma is they successfully appeal two exam scores of 62-64 and have a score of 65 or above on the 
three remaining exams.  We also reserve the right for students to appeal to graduate with a score of 55-61 on the ELA Regents 
Examination. ELL students can earn a local diploma is they successfully appeal a score of 55-61 on the ELA Regents exam and a 
score of 65 or above on the four remaining exams; or successfully appeal a score of 55-61 on the ELA Regents exam and 
successfully appeal one other exam score of 62-64 and score 65 or above on the remaining three exams. These students can 
earn a local diploma.

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At this time, we do not have any ELL-SWDs.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Presently, we do not have any ELL-SWD with IEPs.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our teachers meet in weekly Grade Team Meetings as well as Department Meetings to identify at-risk students who require 
additional support. Students are tracked by the entire staff via weekly surveys. The information from these surveys, in turn, 
allows the Team to brainstorm appropriate strategies to put into place to best support the student. The supports are also 
communicated to the students' advisors, content teachers, as well as parents. Supports can range from Tier 1 to Tier 3, and, of 
course, vary by student. Some strategies we've implemented include: mandated office hours schedule, rewards systems for 
academic/behavior achievement. When deemed appropriate, teachers support students through differentiated assessments, 
assignments and scaffolding for classwork. In addition to integrated ESL, Thomson also provides Freestanding ESL to students 
after school and during lunch. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Due to our small ELL population, we will not be adding any new Programs this year. We will continue to offer Freestanding ENL 
to all of our ELLs. An improvement to the program this year is that we have incorporated more ESL teachers into the process of 
providing services to students. We see this as an improvement since these students will have opportunities to work one-on-
one with ESL staff for integrated classroom support. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We will not be discontinuing any programs/services for ELLs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are offered the same after-school programs as the rest of the student body. Students are invited to participate in after-
school programs through a brochure that is disseminated to the entire student body. ELLs are encouraged by their advisors to 
participate in at least one after-school activity, and to attend office hours beforehand. Advisors may provide students with an 
office-hours schedule. At present, we offer a large variety of school programs including but not limited to Writing Center, 
Running Club, Yoga Club, Game Club, Dance Club, Singing Club, Theatre Club, Black Student Union Club. Supplemental services 
are provided through our advisory program, which meets four times weekly, and affords each student with individual time for 
academic check-ins and necessary supports to be put into place (such as an office hour log). 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Technology is incorportated into all MBHS classrooms. Most teachers teach their lessons on a SmartBoard, and incorporate 
technology-based activities into their curriculum. In addition, students also have access to Computer Carts, which they are 
expected to use for assignments in all classes, ranging from Research to Math. They engage in Internet-based programs (for 
engineering, computer science and stats), as well as Excel, Word and PowerPoint for Common Core-aligned assessments.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support has never been necessary since our students are at the "commanding" level. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The school ensures that all required services/resources correspond to ELLs' age and grade level through our weekly 
conversations at Grade Team and Department meetings. As previously mentioned, since the required services being offered 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

almost entirely on an individual basis, services are specifically designed for each student according to their grade and level. At 
present, we do not service any ELL-SWDs.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Technology is incorportated into all MBHS classrooms. Most teachers teach their lessons on a SmartBoard, and incorporate 
technology-based activities into their curriculum. In addition, students also have access to Computer Carts, which they are 
expected to use for assignments in all classes, ranging from Research to Math. They engage in Internet-based programs (for 
engineering, computer science and stats), as well as Excel, Word and PowerPoint for Common Core-aligned assessments.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before school begins, accepted ELLs are invited to a new student orientation at the school, where they meet current students 
and the faculty members from each department. During the orientation, students take a student-led tour of the school and 
complete activities in small groups led by current students. This provides them with an opportunity to socialize with other new 
students as well as current students. Students are also assigned an Advisor, who is a teacher at the school. All staff members 
are assigned an advisory group. The advisors reach out to the ELLs to introduce themselves as the student's point person and 
to address any needs, concerns and/or questions the student may have before the first day of school.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At present, we offer French and Spanish, levels 1, 2, 3, 4 and Advanced Placement. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Samantha Thomson forwards the "News & Opportunities for Educators of ELLs" monthly emails, which announce PD 
opportunities outside of our building in NYC,  to all of the teachers of ELLs. Additionally, all content area teachers, including 
teachers of ELLs will engage in weekly PDs in our building every Monday during faculty meeting time. This year, teachers are 
also engaging in four inter-Departmental observations (1 per semester on varying days), where they take low-inference notes 
and use those notes in a subsequent faculty PD to conference and improve upon current practices, as well as build in support 
plans for all students. 
PDs are scheduled for Election Day on November 7, 2017 as well as January 3 & June 7, 2018. PDs are designed to ensure that 
all staff meet the requirements, as per the new CR Part 154. In other words, 15% total hours ELL specific PD for all teachers and 
50% total hours ELL specific PD for ESL teachers.  
 Common Core Learning Standards are addressed on a bi-monthly basis in weekly faculty PDs. Amongst our trainings, we 
discuss the shifts in Common Core Standards and how to support all students, including ELLs, in meeting those shifts, like, for 
example, "Building Academic Vocabulary." The faculty does a share-out of activities uses to implement the literacy shifts as 
well as best practices. We have also watched videos that demonstrate the implementation of the common core standards in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

the classroom. MBHS has a large special education population as well as a NEST Program. We believe in meeting students at 
their learning level and in differentiating for all students so they can best learn. ELLs are included in their population, and we 
discuss strategies for helping them to meet course goals. Current supports include Tier 1, 2 and 3.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We continue to support our ELLs by informing the staff of their previous status during Grade Team Meetings. Subject area 
teachers creates the supports they see necessary for the student to achieve the course objectives. ELLs are also encouraged to 
take advantage of the daily office hours schedule offered by all teachers. Samantha Thomson also provides individual support 
to students during a weekly office hour. During this time, students identify content areas of concern, and receive support in 
them. Our guidance team also receive PDs focused on helping ELLs transition from middle school to high school. The team, in 
turn, turnkeys these strategies to the entire faculty during a faculty meeting.   
Our school holds PDs on Election Day & Chancellor's Conference Day that address ELL instruction and Common Core-aligned 
lesson samples. Activities include strategy share-outs, move clips that demonstrate best practices, article readings and jigsaw 
activities. Best practices are also built into our PD cycle in faculty meetings. During Grade Team Meetings, we also teach 
teachers how to identify students. Agendas and attendance is taken at all school-oriented PDs, Grade Team Meetings, 
Department Meetings as well as Faculty Meetings. Our school is also part of the AVID-pilot program, which provides PDs in 
supporting ELLs achievement of Common Core Standards. Teachers have been informed of the new CR Part 154 requirements 
with regards to ELL PDs and also take responsibility for keeping personal records of the PDs they attend.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school services a very small amount of ELLs, but Ms. Thomson is in communication with all of the parents throughout the 
year to communicate each student's progress. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parent involvement is deeply valued in our school community. We build in parent communication specifically through the 
Advisory Program, which pairs every student with a teacher for their four years in high school. The advisor frequently 
communicates both struggles and success to the parents via email/phone/individual meetings. ELL parents are invited to Open 
Houses as well as Curriculum Night to meet their students' teachers and to become acquainted with the curriculum. Parents 
are also invited to Parent Association events throughout the year, including monthly Parent Association Meetings, Holiday 
Events & Potlucks. Of course, parents also come to the school for Parent-Teacher Conferences as well. In accordance with the 
New CR Part 154, annual meetings are also scheduled with parents/guardians to discuss their child's progress.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Kevin Conway, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our ESL Coordinator, Samantha Thomson, meets with our Pupil Accounting Secretary Linda Gioia to take 
inventory of the incoming students for each new school year. Together, they determine which students are new 
to the NYC public schools system or that have been out of NYS public schools for 24 months. If need be, our team 
contacts previous DOE schools or NYS public schools to obtain student information. The parents of these students 
are then invited to Millennium Brooklyn High School so that Ms. Thomson can administer the HLIS form to them. 
Also, if necessary, our team provides translation services for parents during the HLIS administration. For students 
with IEPs, the school-based language proficiency team meets to determine whether the students disabilities 
prevent language progress. If so, we will follow procedures for exemption.  

Once the HLIS is administered, we show parents the "Parent Orientation Video" on the DOE website in theirs 
preferred language, as indicated in the HILS (oral communication language preference). Ms. Gioia enters the HLIS 
information into ATS. After students' ELL status has been determined, a letter in parents preferred language, as

indicated in the HLIS (written communication language preference) is sent home to parents within 5 days to 
inform them as well as to give instructions that they can appeal the ELL status within 45 days, if they so wish. 
Parents are invited to choose the English as a Second Language programs offered at our school, and also informed 
that if they want a Dual Language Program or Bilingual Program (which we currently don't have the capacity to 
offer, but if at a given time we have adequate student necessity we will offer) that we can help transfer their 
student to a school that offers such programs. Parents are asked to sign copies of the letter acknowledging their 
choice and then copies of these letters are filed.  

In addition to the HLS, parents are asked to complete the Blue Emergency Cards, which states their Home 
Language & Language Preference.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

How does your school plan to provide 

 

interpretation service(s)?  

 

In June we have a Parent Orientation 
for new students to meet the 
teachers and on September 29th, we 
invite the parents to school for 
Curriculum Night. PA meetings are 
also held monhtly on Thursday. Fall 
and spring Parent Teacher 
Conferences are held twice, once 
November 19-20th & March 10-11th. 
Our attendance team meets bi-
monthly and the Pupil Secretary 
contacts parents every time a student 
is absent from school. Advisors also 
reach out to parents regularly to 
communicate any academic and/or 
social progress and concerns. For 
students who meet regularly with a 
social worker or SLP, these 
professionals may be more frequently 
in contact with parents. Our Special 
Education Team also meets with 
parents to discuss IEPs for our 
students as well as progress being 
made towards IEP goals. Our college 
counselor holds a Town Hall for junior 
parents to provide them with 
information on the college process.

As per the regulations, parents are greeted with the offical DOE Welcome Poster, Bill of Rights, Language ID Guide at 
security desk and main office and Parent's Guide to Language Access. At the beginning of the scool year, we send a 
letter to parents offering translation and interpretation services for any correspondence or meetings. Our school also 
has a number of bilingual staff, that speak multiple languages. This staff is available to help in communicating with 
parents.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Every student at our school is assigned an advisor who communicates weekly with parents. Through the advisor we 
are able to determine the quality and availability of services. This also assessed more formally through the Parent 
Surveys which are distributed in multiple languages in the spring.
