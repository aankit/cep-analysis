Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS/IS 187 continues striving towards nurturing diverse learners in grades PreK-8 who challenge themselves 
academically, think critically, and actively participate in their community.  

 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS/IS 187 Hudson Cliffs School is a PreK-8 community school distinguished by its traditions in celebrating student 
successes, diverse population, and the cooperative engagement of all its members. Most of its students start in PreK 
and stay through eighth-grade, with about 20 new students entering in sixth-grade. Our 10-year span creates long-
term relationships between students and teachers and a close community feeling; our kids literally grow up in our 
building. In addition, the principal and several faculty members are alumni, and several children are third generation 
PS/IS 187 students.  

 

Our CEP goals for the 2018-2019 school year will include continuing to enhance our methods of communication with 
our parent body; continue to focus on the social-emotional needs of our students, and challenging students in our 
diverse student body through robust and differentiated instruction. In order to achieve these goals, parents, teachers, 
and administrators are continually exploring ways to improve academic performance, provide a variety of programs, 
build community, and create connections between the elementary school and the middle school. With these goals in 
mind, this year saw the continuation of successful programs and the implementation of some new ones. 

In 2017-18, the school offered its third consecutive year of Saturday Academy, an enrichment program for students 
who scored high and low 2's on the previous year’s ELA and/or Math exams in grades 3-8. Students were not only able 
to receive support in both Literacy and Math, but they were also able to participate in Art, Physical Education, and 
Music as well. Students scoring low 2’s and 1’s on the ELA and Math exams were provided additional support via our 
academic intervention after-school program. The 2018-19 school year will continue to provide students in fifth & sixth 
grade with after-school math enrichment programs as well as Regents algebra prep courses in the eighth-grade.  

Students in grades PreK-8 continue to be encouraged to participate in any of the many after-school clubs and 
activities the school has throughout the year which are funded by our Parent Teacher Organization (PTO). School-
wide, students, and family were able to take part in a weekly open library program aimed at promoting and fostering 
reading as families. Our younger students in kindergarten-second grade had the opportunity to sign up for activities 
such as Science club and arts and crafts, while our third and fourth-graders could try their hand at Lego robotics. 
Through the DOE's CHAMPS program, students in grades 3-8 were able to participate in the school’s track team which 
competed in several meets throughout the school year. For those fourth-graders interested in expanding their vocal 
abilities, they were to join a grade-specific singing group called the “Fourth Grade Falsettos” while our middle school 
students had the option to either audition for the annual musical, join the middle school choir, or consider running on 
our track team.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our special student populations are as follows: 17% of our population is students with disabilities, and 7% of our 
students are ENLs*. For students with learning challenges but no IEP, we provide intervention in both Literacy and 
Math to assist them to perform on or above grade level. As a PreK-8 school, our benefit is that we have most of our 
children for 10 years; however, the PreK8 model adversely affects our funding since our budget does not take into 
account the different levels (i.e. second-grade beginning ENL cannot be placed with an eighth-grader). AWAITING 
NEW DATA IN ORDER TO UPDATE.  
 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

This academic year, parent leaders, teachers, and administration (Principal Chory, Assistant Principal Marrero, Ms. 
Daskaris) collaborated on the revision of our school’s mission and vision statements to better reflect our school. 
Through a workshop model, the School Leadership Team had input from all of the key stakeholders in our community. 

 

During the 2017-2018 school year, we saw a 3.9% increase in literacy and a 4.5% increase in math scores, with more 
students performing at level 3 and 4. In addition, we have a 97.3% attendance rate and a less than 1% suspension 
rate. These statistics illustrate that all the elements of the Framework for Great Schools are addressed at our school; 
however, after analyzing our math and Literacy data (51% math and 61% ELA scoring 3 or 4 on state exams*), we aim 
to achieve higher.  
 
Our key areas of focus for the 2018-19 school year include increasing communication by expanding the methods of 
delivery (fliers, school website, & PupilPath) and participation in project based learning such as multicultural 
celebrations, wax museum, and science celebration; strengthening our students' social-emotional skills by using 
various approaches (i.e. Teachers & Writers, student government) and challenging all learners in our diverse student 
body through differentiated instruction.  
 

The goals in our CEP will focus on all the elements in the Framework for Great Schools, as we ensure 187 students 
leave the building well prepared for life’s next set of challenges.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

During the 2017-18 school year, we saw a 3.9% increase in literacy and a 4.5% increase in math scores (including 
Algebra I Regents, with more students performing at level 3 and 4. In addition, we have a 97.6% attendance rate and a 
less than 1% suspension rate. These statistics illustrate that all of the elements of the Framework for Great Schools 
are addressed at our school. It is important to note that the data does not reflect the Math Regents scores for which 
98% of our 8th graders pass with a score of 65 or higher. Also, our scores are affected by the number of students 
opting out of the annual state assessments. *data source: NYSED data; June Instructional Report 2018; STARS 
Regents Scores Report 

 

Our key areas of focus for the 2018-19 school year include increasing communication by expanding the methods of 
delivery (backpack fliers, school website, PupilPath) and participation in project-based learning such as multicultural 
celebrations, wax museum, and science celebrations; strengthening our students' social-emotional skills by using 
various approaches and challenging all learners in our diverse student body through differentiated instruction.  

 

The goals in our CEP will focus on all the elements in the Framework for Great Schools, as we ensure 187 students 
leave the building well prepared for life’s next set of challenges. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

To reinforce the school’s commitment to student-centered pedagogy.  

By June 2019, 100% of students will demonstrate growth in all content area as demonstrated by an increase in the use 
of Higher Order Thinking questioning, Classroom Response Systems, Socratic seminars, and other methodologies 
emphasizing rigorous instruction in the classroom.  

In doing so, students in all grade levels will demonstrate growth of two reading levels in their reading comprehension as 
assessed by Fountas & Pinnell (K-3) and performance tasks (3-8)

By February of 2019, upon reviewing data provided by Schoolnet from performance tasks/performance series, 
Fountas & Pinnell, and portfolio reviews, we will see a 6% growth in our overall student performance. Students not 
meeting this benchmark will be provided additional support via after-school group sessions and/or Saturday Academy 
wherein the student(s) can receive smaller, more inclusive learning which in turn should allow for the child to exhibit 
the growth anticipated.  

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Fountas and Pinnell data will be reviewed in grades K-3, and performance tasks/performance series in grades 3- 8 as

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
It is the utmost importance to build capacity to identify and understand the social-emotional development of our 
students, so that we may foster a sense of ownership for the school within them while providing leadership 
opportunities and ensuring students have a voice in future school plans.  

Through weekly Advisory lessons, students will engage in learning about self-awareness, self-regulation and their 
ability to articulate positive plans for their futures. They will also learn to contribute to a positive school environment 
through enhancing their team-building skills- student government. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will receive training in Emotionally Responsive Practices (ERP). Through training, 
teachers will learn to implement strategies to improve classroom behavior/de-escalation in order to support the 
development of pro-social behaviors in students throughout grades PreK-8 and reduce the amount of behavioral 
referrals to our school counselors by 50%.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

By June 2019, 100% of our faculty and administration will work on an increasing collaboration which will lead to 
improvement of student strengths. We will include all teachers including: teachers of ENLs, and teachers of SWDs in 
common planning so that lessons can be differentiated to meet all students at their entry points. Our student 
population is broken down as follows: 1. ENLs representing 8.5% 2. SWDs representing 14.4%. Using state data, there 
is a 3 to 4 percent rise every year since 2012 (additionally, the school recognizes performance tasks and growth 
evident in them). This data comes from New York State Mathematics and ELA tests and NYSESLAT tests. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June of 2019, 100% of the staff will participate in a minimum of 6 teacher-driven common planning sessions focusing 
on differentiation to challenge all learners (ENL’s, SWD’s, accelerated) as evidenced by sign-in sheets.

We will provide academic intervention programs, such as Saturday Academy, and educational support services. We 
will implement outreach efforts to identify the STH population and we will also offer counseling services and 
assistance with accessing school programs. We will also make basic emergency supplies such as food and clothing 
available to families that need them. Once our STH population has been identified, we will offer extended school 
library hours for those students who need access to resources. Collection and the study of data will be continuous 
towards the identification of STH students and their needs and the monitoring of their progress. Transportation 
assistance for permanently housed students will also be made available.  

As a school community, we also coordinate food drives and provide various resources to assist those families in need.  

 

3. Some Non-Title I schools receive a specific allocation based on the reported number of students living in temporary 
housing.  If your school received an allocation (please refer to the current Title I Funds Summary of School Allocation 
Memorandum), include the amount your school received in this question.  If your school did not receive an allocation 
and needs assistance in identifying resources to assist STH students, please contact an STH liaison. 

We received $16,000.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS/IS 187 Hudson Cliffs School, will strive to create and implement a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection between the school and the families in order to enhance the support 
of student achievement . The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in 
planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively 
participate on the School Leadership Team and Parent Teacher Organization as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

PS/IS 187 Hudson Cliffs School will support parents and families of students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills, and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were 
consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. 
To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title

the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

●provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

●Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of

To assist in the achievement of our ENL students' language goals, after school programs will be 
offered to those students struggling to meet grade level expectations and newcomers. 1. ENL 
students in Kindergarten and Grade 1 will be invited to a Newcomer Literacy group.  Ms. 
Neidish will provide direct instruction in low level literacy skills, including phonics, sight word 
usage and meaning, and reading comprehension skills.  Every lesson will include a read-aloud 
focusing on the topic of the day, and direct instruction of the skill.  Students will receive phonics 
workbooks to practice their English skills.  Students will also practice their reading and speaking 
skills through reader’s theatre, where they will have the ability to become a character in the 
books read aloud by Ms. Neidish.  The program will utilize Reader's Theater Back to School, 
RT: Winter Edition, and RT: Spring Bundle, purchased from Teachers pay Teachers.  The 
program will require drawing supplies for students to create images of the characters they will 
portray- as well as notebooks/journals for practicing the writing and reading skills taught by Ms. 
Neidish. Students will also receive access to Raz-Kids, where they can practice their phonics and 
reading skills.  Students will also receive a folder they can use to keep their work. All materials 
purchased by Title III will be used solely for the Title III Program for it's duration.  
This program will take place on Wednesdays from 2:40-3:40.  There will be 18 sessions 
beginning in October 2018 and ending in March 2019.2.  English Language Learner students in 
grades 1 and 2 are invited to the “Literacy Leaders” after school program. Ms. Burley will 
provide direct instruction in literacy skills, including phonics, sight word recognition and 
understanding, and reading comprehension, based around content topics and vocabulary.  We 
will utilize Brain Pop Jr. to reinforce these ideas and provide students with multiple means of 
receiving information. Students will receive access to a personalized account in Raz-Kids and 
Headsprout. Students will practice phonics, and read books at their assigned reading level and 
complete quizzes that provide feedback to the teacher on skills needing to be 
addressed.  Students will receive a notebook and folder to store their after school items. All 
materials purchased by Title III will be used solely for the Title III Program for it's duration. This 
program will be run by Ms. Burley. 
This program will take place on Wednesdays from 2:40-3:40.  There will be 18 sessions 
beginning in October 2018 and ending in March 2019. 
3.  English Language Learner students in grades 3 and 4 are invited to the “Content Crushers” 
after school program. This program will focus on building student’s knowledge of content based 
vocabulary, and topics such as synonyms, antonyms, prefixes, suffixes, homophones and context 
clues to assist students in their ability to understand words and texts.   Materials for this after 
school group will include Science A-Z for access to science related readings. In addition, 
Reading A-Z will be utilized for readings with social studies and other content topics.  We will 
also utilize videos via BrainPop Jr to assist with grammar and vocabulary topics we cover. 
Newcomer students in this group will receive an Oxford Dictionary that they will utilize during 
the program to assist them in conceptualizing themes and the vocabulary associated with 
them. Students will also receive a folder and notebook they can use to keep their work. All

For the 2018-2019 school year, ENL teachers (Ms. Burley, Ms. Neidish, Ms. Matos, Ms. 
Friedman) will be part of an English Language Development Study Group.  Teachers will be 
responsible for preparing a summary of a specific reading, and creating a plan to implement an 
idea discussed in the text in their classes.  English Language Development Study Groups will 
meet after school, 3 times (December 14, January 25, March 1).  Title III funds will be used to 
purchase the books for the teachers (1. Common Core for the Not So Common Learner, and 2, 
Collaboration and Co-Teaching: Strategies for English Language Learners) and fund their 
meetings. By utilizing these books, we allow for a focus in a special population, in 
alignment with the standards and expectations of school.  A book focused on collaboration and 
co-teaching will assist ENL teachers in their Integrated classrooms.  A book concerning the 
Common Core and special populations within a school allows all teachers access to strategies 
and ideas that can benefit their teaching and the students. 
Additionally, an ASPDP course regarding the teaching of ELL students will be attended by one 
of the ENL teachers.  The information learned in the course will be shared with the other ENL 
teachers. The course (Supporting Mastery of ENL Standards with Technology Usage) will be 
purchased using Title III funds, and the turnkey will occur on a Monday after school PD time.  
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

This year PS/IS will hold Parent Workshops.  In the beginning of the school year, a workshop 
will be held specifically for ELL parents regarding communication with teachers (mainly 
PupilPath), and identifying the different events that parents are encouraged to attend throughout 
the school year.  This workshop will be geared towards middle school ELL parents, and will be 
held during Parent Engagement and Parent Teacher Conference time by Ms. Matos.  Parents will 
be able to sign up for one of three sessions, in order to plan around their parent conferences.  
 
A  workshop will be held in December to remind the ELL parents of different activities and ways 
to encourage their children to continue reading and learning.  Parents will be reminded of the 
Raz-Kids access their child has, and how to engage with their child about the book.  A list of 
helpful websites and free resources will be shared.  Additional teacher-developed materials will 
be offered to parents at the workshop that will keep students actively thinking throughout the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45

winter break.  This workshop will be held after school hours, in one afternoon and one evening 
session.  
 
Another workshop will be held in January discussing the NYSESLAT.  Topics to be covered 
include: what parents can expect for their children on those testing days, the layout of the exam, 
and general "what to know" for the students. Additionally, the expectations for the scoring of the 
NYSESLAT will be shared along with model responses.  Parents will become aware of the types 
of questions that are asked during the exam, emphasizing the importance of developing 
descriptive language.  Parents will leave with a personal list of NYSESLAT inspired questions 
that they can utilize with their child in their daily lives.  This list will be translated for parents in 
the home language. This workshop will be held after school hours, in one afternoon and one 
evening session.  
 
The workshops will be an hour long. Ms. Burley, Ms. Neidish, Ms. Matos and Ms. Friedman will 
all be present to provide information to the parents at the workshops. Based on parent home 
languages, we will use Translation and Interpretation funding to provide interpreters for lower 
incidence languages. For those families who speak Spanish, translation will be provided by Ms. 
Matos. Pizza and refreshments will be offered at the workshops to encourage participation.

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In grades K-4, our school utilizes Fountas and Pinnell to assess the students’ independent and instructional reading 
levels.   Within all classrooms, students take formative assessments based on curriculum, including vocabulary and grammar 
mini units.  Students in grades K-2 follow Fundations units, which is helpful in assessing the students’ basic understandings and 
foundations of the English language. 
 
Fountas & Pinnell is used as a tool to determine which level book is appropriate for independent reading and instructional 
reading for any given child. Most of our Kindergarten ELLs begin anywhere between Level A-C (Kindergarten level books). As 
they learn to practice their reading and comprehension strategies, they graduate through the levels. Our early elementary ELLs 
tend to read at a level that is approximately one grade-level below the grade they are currently in.  As the students get older, 
the difference between their reading level and grade level expectations increases. In addition, the Fundations Program (an 
early elementary decoding and phonics program) is taught in all classrooms Grades K-2. This program has proven successful in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

our school in providing a consistent way of teaching early elementary literacy skills that progress in sophistication through the 
early grades. All teachers use exit slips throughout their units to measure student understanding of topics. Based on the 
results, teachers may decide to re-teach whole class, small group, or feel comfortable moving onto the next topic. 
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers are aware of the ELLs that receive services in their classroom.  Classroom and ENL teachers meet during common 
planning and prep periods to discuss student progress.  The ENL teacher provides a folder that contains different options to 
encourage communication between the teachers.  This folder includes a calendar and chart with student names to utilize for 
grades and notes. 
 
The information from Fountas & Pinnell, Fundations, Exit Slips, and other teacher created assessments helps to inform our 
school's instructional plan. ENL teachers are aware of each child's strengths and weaknesses in language skills and address 
them appropriately using intervention strategies  Also, ENL teachers have an understanding of where the child is currently 
reading and their next steps. This formative assessment allows teachers to determine what aspects of literacy need to be 
focused on in the classroom. 
 
Furthermore, these assessments allow teachers to determine grouping in their classrooms.  Students who have a higher 
independent reading level can do independent work, while the teacher focuses on those students with a lower instructional 
level.  Texts need to be at the exact level that they challenge the students without overwhelming them. 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
This year our school is implementing NYC Performance Tasks in ELA and Math to help in assessing the levels and progress of 
our students.  Teachers in grades K-3 continue to utilize Fountas and Pinnell as a summative assessment.  Also, students in all 
grades continue to receive summative assessments based on the completed instructional units.  
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In the Intermediate school, many teachers have Small Group Intervention periods in which they can target struggling students 
in regards to content area instruction as well as more foundational learning.  This type of assistance also takes place during the 
menu periods of teachers in the elementary school.   The teachers can work with specific children on specific needs based on 
their performance on assessments. The Elementary school also utilizes a reading specialist to work with struggling students, 
these students are chosen based on their performance on the State Exams and other assessments, such as the Performance 
Tasks and classroom assessments. All teachers use rubrics and analyze student work to assist where they have a difficulty in 
understanding. For ENL teachers specifically, the modality breakdown in the NYSITELL report provides an understanding of 
where students need more intensive English support. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We determine whether additional services are needed to provide assistance for particular students who score below specified 
levels of performance on the NYSESLAT.  This is decided on an individual basis, as students have diverse schooling and 
language backgrounds.  Many factors, including years of service, type of program, native language literacy, SIFE status, 
emotional needs, and previous NYSESLAT scores, are considered when deciding the next steps in the student’s school needs.  If 
there seem to be more factors than just limited years of service, it may  be decided by the ENL or classroom/content teacher 
to add additional tiers of support to the students’ instruction.   
 
ELL students receive Tier 1 Interventions daily, through modeling, feedback from teachers, visuals, and other supports.  If an 
ELL student fails to show signs of growth in language development, Tier 2 and 3 interventions are implemented.  This would 
include, for example, previewing listening passages, paired reading, choral reading, repeated readings, focus on oral language, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

use of differentiated graphic organizers, and many more supports. At a higher Tier level, instruction becomes more tailored to 
the specific needs and students.  Utilizing this framework allows for fewer ELL students to be placed in special education 
services without proper record of intervention services.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
When evaluating the success of our program for ELLs, we look at the NYSESLAT data for specific trends. First, we look at the 
students who attain Commanding on the NYSESLAT.  Then, we look at the overall percentages of ELLs who scored at the 
Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, and Expanding Levels. We note the percentages of students who increase in their language 
proficiency, those who maintain their level, and those who may decline in their proficiency level. We take into account the 
number of ELLs who may have IEPs. It is also important to know if a student’s overall level may have dropped in part due to 
the transitioning into a more difficult grade band. 
 
The 2017 NYSESLAT data reveals that approximately 12% of our students made gains in proficiency level, including those 
becoming Commanding. Approximately 18% of our ELL students maintained their proficiency level.  Approximately 1% of our 
students decreased in proficiency level.  These numbers show that 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

NYSESLAT results are analyzed as soon as they become available.  The necessary reports are downloaded from ATS and 
inserted into the EDAT file.  From this file and from studying the different aspects of student scores listed above, information is 
collected and shown to the current ENL teachers. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In Freestanding ENL, students are seen both in integrated and stand alone instruction delivery models.  In grades K-8 
ELL students are found in each classroom. The proficiency level of the students in each of these grades is 
heterogeneous.  The ENL teacher pushes into the ELA classroom, fulfilling the needs of students accordingly. 
Transitioning- Commanding students' required minutes are fulfilled during this time.  In addition, the stand alone 
program is utilized to fulfill the remainder of the Entering-Emerging students required minutes.  The grouping in these 
grades includes a range of student grade levels (while staying within the 2 contiguous year requirement), while trying 
to stay as closely homogeneous in language proficiency as possible. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

In order to ensure that students are receiving the correct amount and type of instructional ENL minutes in our Freestanding 
ENL program, we utilized information from the ELL Policy and Reference Guide, which includes the following 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

information:  Students with a language proficiency of Entering or Emerging require 360 minutes of ENL instruction per 
week.  For Entering students, the time is split between integrated ELA and stand alone ENL.  The same can be done for 
Emerging students, however it is only required that 90 minutes of their time be stand alone ENL, which allows for that extra 90 
minutes to be covered in an integrated ELA or another content classroom. 
 
Transitioning and Expanding students are required to receive 180 minutes of ENL instruction.  Transitioning students are 
required to receive 90 of these minutes in integrated ELA, allowing for the other 90 to be Stand Alone ENL, or integrated 
content.  Expanding and Commanding students are not allowed to receive time in Stand Alone ENL, and are therefore allowed 
their 180 or 90 minutes, respectively, in integrated ELA or content classrooms. 
 
ENL teachers and content area teachers utilize a co-teaching model to provide integrated ENL services. Stand Alone ENL is 
taught by an ENL teacher in a separate classroom. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Core content is delivered to students in each program model. In Integrated ENL there is both a content and an ENL teacher. In 
Stand Alone ENL, the ENL teacher provides small group instruction for language objectives. All instruction is delivered in 
English. In all classrooms ELL Strategies are implemented, such as modeling, use of pictures, addressing language focuses in 
the content, and many more. 
 
The content areas for ELLs are delivered in the following way. In ENL, each lesson has a double objective. The first objective is a 
content area objective (science, social studies, literature, etc.). The second objective is to learn and practice a new English 
language structure (spoken and written). This new English language structure is taught within the context of the content area 
objective, which gives students an opportunity to reinforce new academic vocabulary and concepts while learning to speak, 
listen, read, and write in English. While Freestanding ENL is usually considered to be a 100% English immersion program, our 
ENL teachers do provide native language support as needed and as applicable. Content is delivered via Integrated and Stand 
Alone ENL services. We do not offer Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual Education at this time. 
 
Within both Integrated and Stand Alone program models, small grouping is utilized. Teachers use formative assessments to 
identify students struggling with content or language within the content. 
Throughout consecutive years, materials and supplements often build upon each other. Our school utilizes CUBES as a math 
process and graphic organizer for all grades to identify key information and solve problems. This benefits students, as when 
they are focusing on learning new math concepts, they have the familiarity of this CUBES process and graphic organizer. 
Teachers also use similar graphic organizers in other content areas that remain the same (for example, the KWL chart) or grow 
according to grade standards (for example, a Story Elements chart). 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We do not currently assess students in their native language.   There are some books in various languages in the ENL 
classroom. Spanish speaking students have access to Spanish literature through the Raz-Kids subscription. The information 
accessed by the students is not evaluated. 
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Our plans for differentiating instruction for specific ELL subgroups are as follows: 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

a. Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE): 
 
SIFE students are identified as students who have attended schools in the US for less than 12 months, and are either two or 
more years below grade-level in literacy in their home language or in math, due to inconsistent or interrupted education prior 
to arrival in the US.  There are tools to help identify SIFE developed by NYSED.   
 
The Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS) can be used to determine the literacy levels of SIFE in their home language as 
well as in English in order to provide or to design appropriate placement and instruction for these students. The MLS is 
currently available in nine languages: Bengali, Chinese, English, Haitian Creole, Spanish, Arabic, Urdu, S’gaw Karen, and Maay 
Maay.   
 
In addition, we will use the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire to determine the number and length of interruptions. This 
questionnaire is available in the following languages: Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, Haitian Creole, 
Korean, Polish, Russian, and Urdu. 
 
When deemed necessary, SIFE students can meet with the school’s guidance counselor to discuss their feelings which may be 
about being either older than their classroom peers or having less experience in a school environment. It is important that SIFE 
students are aware of their situation and that there are staff members who care about them and are available to counsel 
them. Instruction for SIFE students will be differentiated on a student by student basis depending on their specific areas of 
need. Extra help will be offered within and outside regular school hours to practice foundational skills. SIFE students are highly 
encouraged to join the Title III ELL After School Programs. 
 
In their first year of schooling, students are exempt from taking the ELA exam.  They are offered to take the Math or Science 
exam in their home language, if available.  After their first year, these students also continue to receive ELL accommodations 
for tests. 
 
 
b. Newcomer ELLs 
 
For our newcomers who have had less or no school instruction, we use a program called Reading Rods for English Language 
Learners – Newcomer Themes. This kit offers forty lessons organized around ten themes that are immediately useful to 
newcomer students. Themes such as school, family, food, and clothing help children acquire important vocabulary for day-to-
day communication. Other themes pave the way for content-area learning by introducing concepts such as time, money, 
transportation, and communities. 
 
For children who are pre-literate, we emphasize oral language and shared writing activities, along with writing basic sentences. 
We combine language instruction with literacy activities such as phonics and word work, utilizing Headsprout, an interactive 
phonics website.  We utilize Reading Rods to help students build a foundation with phonemic awareness, word building and 
sentence building. 
 
A website that has proved useful is edhelper.com. This site, among other things, contains a section of Basic English language 
themes, such as objects in the classroom, forms of transportation, colors, shapes, etc. Teachers and students can print a 
picture word wall with reading and writing activities that utilize the vocabulary within each theme. 
 
In their first year of schooling, students are exempt from taking the ELA exam.  They are offered the option to take the Math or 
Science exam in their home language, if available. 
 
For Newcomer ELLs who come to our school and test at a higher proficiency level, we still provide the same social-emotional 
guidance.  Even if students have had consistent schooling, moving to a new country, state, or school can be a stressful 
experience.  We encourage students to speak with counselors, and to attend ENL after school programs to get to know their 
peers. We give a school tour to all new families, and provide a "directory" of important locations for student reference.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 
c. Developing ELLs 
 
These students are either ready to test out of ESL services, or are at risk of becoming Long-Term ELLs.  They have received 4-6 
years of ENL services. Teachers constantly use formative assessments to ensure that they know whether or not the student in 
their classrooms, including ELLs, need support in certain areas. Depending on their English proficiency level, students are seen 
in their classrooms or separately throughout the day. ENL teachers work with classroom teachers to understand the standards 
the students are striving to meet and to provide assistance with content in the classroom. ENL teachers incorporate language 
and content objectives into their lessons. 
 
Testing practice and lessons designed to assist students in building stamina (such as various writing activities throughout units, 
and complex math problems) are used in the classrooms for all students.  These content based testing strategies ensure that 
students are gaining the content of the unit, as well as grammar, form and other important understandings needed for real-
world experiences. 
 
 
 
d. Long-term ELLs 
 
For these students, their continuation in ENL may be more of a literacy deficiency rather than an English language deficiency. 
We continue to service them in our core program during the regular school day. The ENL teacher services the students in their 
Literacy classes, which allows these students to receive more individualized attention for grade-level coursework. The ENL 
teachers work with the classroom teachers to provide graphic organizers or scaffolds to allow students to succeed in their 
classrooms. 
 
To supplement the core program, ELLs and LTEs also have access to small group instructional groups in the After School 
Enrichment program.  They can receive these services with an ENL teacher, or with content teachers. 
 
 
e. Former ELLs 
 
These students receive support for two years after performing Commanding on the NYSESLAT.  Receiving 90 minutes weekly 
for these two transitioning years of support is extremely helpful to the student as they merge into mainstream classrooms 
with limited support. They will continue to receive ENL support as Developing ELLs do, in Integrated ENL or Content; however, 
they receive services at a reduced amount.   
 
Former ELLs are a great support for non-commanding ELL students.  They can be used a peer support, especially if they have a 
similar culture or language to newer, low-proficiency students.  Sometimes former ELLs are high performers in their 
classrooms and are great models for academic language.  Most teachers utilize student reading levels, and assessment grades 
to determine a students understanding. If former ELLs are determined to need support outside of what is provided them from 
their ENL teacher, they receive supports similarly to other non-ELLs in their classroom.  One-to-one conferences with the 
teacher, graphic organizers, and models of assignments are among the many strategies used for differentiation in the 
classroom.  
 
These students also continue to receive ELL Accommodations for state testing for two years, in addition to any other testing 
accommodations listed on their IEP, if applicable. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs identified as having IEPs require specialized education, and social and psychological services in order to maximize their full 
potential. ENL teachers and service providers collaborate to help these students overcome their learning obstacles. ELL-SWDs 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

have access to the same grade-level resources as their General Education counterparts with scaffolding to make the material 
more comprehensible and accessible, such as graphic organizers and audio/visual supports, use of technology, and small group 
instruction, when required. 
Students receive high interest books that provide them access to the content being discussed in class. ENL teachers and Special 
Education Teachers work together to develop the text based discussions to benefit all students with learning needs. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We currently serve our ELLs-SWDs in the least restrictive model, ICT.  The teachers implement instructional strategies using 
grade-level materials that are designed to meet the unique needs of ELLs and SWDs. They collaborate during weekly common 
planning periods to ensure that instruction is differentiated to meet the students' needs.  In the classroom, special groupings 
occur when the lesson calls for it, and the communication between teachers allows for this grouping to be purposeful.  ENL 
teachers are in constant communication with Special Education teachers to report student progress, as well as updated 
information and policies. 
We ensure that ELL-SWDs receive all services mandated on their IEPs by scheduling their services during different times of the 
week/day so as not to overlap with one another or with required ELL instructional minutes.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA include using Wilson Reading System. Students work with Wilson daily, in 
addition to receiving ELL strategies such as visuals and reading techniques. Other strategies include modeling, and creating 
opportunities for developing background knowledge, such as field trips and hands on activities. 
 
ELL students who score low on the ELA state exam also are eligible to join small-group academic services classes held during 
the day. Academic services are offered to ELL students at all levels based on needs noticed by ENL teachers and classroom 
teachers. 
 
In math, students receive manipulatives which allow them to see concepts in various different ways. 
 
In Social Studies and Science, targeted intervention uses the same strategies as would be used in a Literacy class. Modeling, 
previews of texts, close readings, and paired readings are all utilized to ensure students gain the most language and content 
from lessons. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are constantly on the lookout for programs and other ideas that can improve the quality of learning for our students.  One 
major concern is the discrepancy in grade level and reading ability.  One improvement we are continuing to build upon in our 
middle school, particularly, is the amount of high interest, low reading level books for students to become engaged in. Another 
improvement we are focusing on in elementary classrooms is guided reading, to ensure small group instruction with all 
students, based on their reading level. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not have, and did not close a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs. They are fully represented in programs such as Technology, Music, and 
Art.  Additional afterschool programs offered in the past include Scrapbooking, Book Clubs, Board Game Clubs, and Sports. All 
students are invited, and encouraged to join these programs.   
 
Enrichment activities specifically designed for ELLs are to be determined based on our Title III funds. All help to foster 
socialization for ELLs. ELLs are invited to these programs by letter sent to their parents/guardians. ELL attendance at these Title 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

III programs is closely monitored to gauge participation. Also, because of the lower teacher-student ratio, students are able to 
participate more and receive more personalized attention. 
 
Last year, many supplemental services were offered to our ELLs.  In the middle school there was a Math club, which integrated 
English language skills and Mathematics, as well as a Newcomer ENL Group, focused on students who are new to schooling in 
the United States. In the elementary school there was a Content Crushers group, focused on vocabulary building, and Literacy 
Leaders group, focused on fundamental literacy skills and reading comprehension.  For Kindergarten, students were exposed 
to many books and participated in Reader’s Theater. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Kindergarten ENL follows closely with the topics discussed in the Kindergarten classrooms, when possible.  If the students are 
struggling to perform basic skills necessary to truly engage in their classwork, Ms. Neidish develops lessons that include the 
following: 
-Differentiated instruction in every lesson matches the needs of ELLs at all stages of language acquisition. 
-Three key strands – thematic units, phonics, and guided reading – offer flexibility to customize instruction to meet whole- or 
small-group classroom needs. 
- Thematic approach, based on TESOL and content standards, meets critical accountability needs. It provides social studies, 
science, and math content embedded throughout the program. 
- Books, written to a leveling system specifically created for ELLs, use both reading and language learning criteria to deliver 
vital comprehension strategies. 
- Systematic phonics lessons provide a strong foundation for building fluency. 
- Interactive, multisensory activities engage children’s diverse learning styles. 
- Materials include: manipulative charts, posters, newcomer books, big books, audio CDs,, writing and reading guides, child 
friendly language learning websites, and picture cards. 
 
 
ENL for grades 1-8 utilizes ENL strategies through teaching of content areas, such as Social Studies and Science.  We have 
access to Brain Pop and Brain Pop Jr. which have videos that focus on specific content topics.  Also, we have access to Brain 
Pop ESL, which focuses on grammar and vocabulary development.  Reading A-Z offers many thematic books at various levels to 
use in the classroom while assisting ELL language growth. 
 
Grade K – 4 materials from the Florida Center for Reading Research (http://www.fcrr.org) have been downloaded to further 
differentiate instruction in five language learning strands: phonemic/phonological awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, 
and comprehension. These activities may be independent, pair, or group-work activities that address students’ varying learning 
styles.  We also utilize Reading Rods Newcomer theme, Phonemic Awareness, Word Building, SImple Sentences and Sentence 
Building to assist the students with their English grammar understanding. 
 
ELLs in grades 1-4 have accounts to access www.raz-kids.com, an interactive website that allows students to listen to books, 
take quizzes and record stories at their level and moving at their own pace. Students gain stars with each book read, with 
which they can “purchase” icons in the raz-rockets gaming area. 
 
A number of websites including funbrain.com, starfall.com, brainpop.com, brainpopesl.com, brainpopjr.com and others offer 
students an engaging interactive way to practice their English. 
 
In addition to pre-fabricated teaching materials, the ENL teachers often create their own teacher-made materials to 
differentiate instruction and suit the current needs of their students. 
 
Our teachers modify their use of English to teach core subjects, (math, science, and social studies) in order to ensure that the 
material is comprehensible to learners and that it promotes their second language development. They adjust the language 
demands of the lesson in many ways, by modifying speech rate and tone; direct instruction of vocabulary and grammar;

repeating key words, phrases, or concepts; using context clues and making extensive use of modeling strategies; relating 
instruction to students’ background knowledge and experience; and using certain methods familiar to language teachers 
(demonstrations, visuals, graphic organizers, or cooperative work) to make academic instruction understandable to students of 
different second language proficiency levels.  When applicable, teachers provide students with information using their home 
language.  When teachers have access to materials, or understand the home language of the students, it allows the students a 
way of accessing the information being taught in class. 
 
Content Area Instructional Materials that are used to support ELLs in MATH are: Go Math (Grades K-5) and Impact Math 
(Grades 6-8). Math games, manipulatives, and interactive SMART Board activities are utilized. Math lessons are differentiated 
to support ELLs and Special Education students. 
 
Content Area Instructional Materials that are used to support ELLs in Social Studies are social studies Trade Books (Grades K-8). 
These books give ELLs access to content in other ways than just textbooks.  This year we also received new Social Studies Texts 
Books from McGraw Hill. These lessons are supplemented with video, internet web site, Weekly Reader, National Geographic 
magazines for kids, Time Magazine for Kids, and local newspapers. Social studies lessons are differentiated to support ELLs and 
Special Education students. 
 
Content Area Instructional Materials that are used to support ELLs in Science are Foss Kit (Grades K-5), Glencoe Science (Grade 
6), and Lab-Aids & Setup (Grades 7-8). These lessons are supplemented with videos, hands-on science labs, the Annual Science 
Fair, and science field trips. Science lessons are differentiated to support ELLs and Special Education students. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support, particularly for newcomers, is provided whenever possible.  Many teachers know Spanish at varying 
degrees, which is helpful for students who speak Spanish. For speakers of other languages, there are free websites available to 
ENL teachers to learn key phrases needed to help a newcomer feel welcome and at home as they begin to acquire English. We 
may also find another student in the building who comes from a similar language background and pair them up to help ease 
the transition. Students also have access to bilingual dictionaries, when possible. ENL teachers have books in different 
languages to comfort students.  We also have utilized free online translation services to help us translate written 
communications for students and their families. Parent Bulletins are sent out in English and Spanish, and there are Spanish 
language resources on the school website. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All forms of resources and support listed above for grades K-8 are age-appropriate and they are based on contemporary 
research in the field of teaching English to ELLs. All ENL instruction is aligned with the new Common Core Standards according 
to their grade level. In groups, ENL students receive instruction that is aligned to their grade level. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are not a collocated school. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs are invited to come see our school before they begin their school year.  For kindergarten students there is 
an ice cream social which all families are invited to where they can meet other families also entering the school.   In upper 
grades, students are given a tour of the school by a grade advisor so that the students feel comfortable navigating their 
schedule and hallways before they begin classes. 
The parent coordinator and guidance counselors are always willing to meet with students and families to ensure the students 
feel prepared to start their schooling at PS/IS 187. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

At this time, a Spanish language course is offered to Grade 5, 6, 7 and 8 students. Both ELL and Non-ELL students are 
programmed to take this class. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not currently have a Dual Language program.  
  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ENL teachers will provide professional development and workshops for other teachers and personnel including Guidance 
Counselors, secretaries, and parent coordinators in the school.  Topics covered may include: 
 
2017-2018 
September 
ELL students and the Common Core 
ELL strategies in the content classroom 
November 
Using Targets of Measurement for Meaningful Lesson Objectives 
January 
Collaborative teaching in an integrated classroom 
March 
Understanding the differences between BICS and CALP- What is academic English? 
May/June 
Understanding the differences in Language Acquisition and Language/Learning Disability 
RTI for ELLS 
 
ENL teachers specifically will attend professional development through After School Professional Development Program, and 
other sources such as those offered by the DOE, Manhattan Field Support Center, DELLSS or UFT.  Topics will include: 
Writing across all subjects 
ELLs and the common core classroom 
Collaborative teaching 
Supporting English Language Learners 
Use of RTI in Second Language Classrooms 
Math based Vocabulary 
Writing strategies to promote thinking 
 
The professional development opportunities that are offered will support all teachers in engaging ELL students in the Common 
Core Learning Standards.  Teachers will have the opportunity to observe, manipulate and create meaningful supports for their 
classroom or specific needs.  Teachers will learn about and practice writing language objectives based on CCSS and ToMs to 
help them keep their ELL students focused and engaged in the lessons.  Additionally, at workshops, teachers will have the 
opportunity to work in groups or pairs and help each other to implement language objectives, scaffolds for ELLs and make

other adjustments to their lessons.   ENL teachers and Content teachers will also have the chance to practice co-teaching in 
front of their peers to allow for a healthy conversation on what ‘works’ or doesn’t feel right to them in that situation. These 
activities will benefit the teachers and the ELL students in their classroom.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
ELL Teachers will attend ENL Meetings and professional development held by the UFT and DOE providers. ENL teachers will 
turn-key this information to the staff, to ensure that everyone has access to any new or useful information regarding ELL 
students. These professional development workshops will take place on PD days and on Monday afternoons. 
Topics for the professional development and workshops can include: 
 
ELL students and the Common Core 
ELL strategies in the content classroom 
Using Targets of Measurement for Meaningful Lesson Objectives 
Collaborative teaching in an integrated classroom 
Understanding the differences between BICS and CALP- What is academic English?

Writing strategies to promote thinking 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In accordance with CR-154, ENL teachers will plan to make individual appointments with all ELL student parents.  We will work 
to accommodate all parents’ needs in terms of timing of the meeting, to translation services.  The parents are asked to come 
to this yearly individual meeting to discuss the goals of the program, their child’s language development progress, their child’s 
English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. When applicable, 
classroom or content teachers will also be asked to attend the meeting. We plan to have these meetings in January as this 
provides enough time after our initial parent teacher conferences to implement any next steps discussed.  January meetings 
also allow us to remind parents of the NYSESLAT and the requirements for that exam. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Throughout the school year, we host several Literacy Celebrations, Music and Art shows and field trips, all of which require 
parent attendance and participation to make them successful experiences. Parents feel very welcome to come to our school 
and volunteer their time in and out of the classrooms. PTO meetings provide free translations for parents when necessary. 
Class Parent Representatives (one in each homeroom) play an intermediary role between teachers and the parent community. 
They help the teacher plan class events, solicit parent volunteers, and encourage parent participation. 
 
We will provide two to three parent meetings throughout the year.  The topics will include Supporting Your Student in School 
(October), NYSESLAT Parent Workshop (January), and Summer Fun: Learning All Year (June).  
This year we hope to initiate a multicultural night.  A night that emphasizes all cultures will promote good relationships 
between families and the school.  We hope that this night will break barriers which will allow families to feel comfortable with 
new school systems.  It is important for all families to know that they are respected and safe in our school community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Cynthia Chory, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During registration, parents and guardians are asked to inform the school of their preferred language of 
communication. With this information, we know whether it is necessary to provide translation services for that 
parent. The staff in charge of conducting registration are fluent in both English and Spanish, and provide 
assistance when needed. We also utilize information from the student's blue cards located in the main office, and 
parent surveys conducted by the Parent Teacher Association to fully understand the language preferences of our 
families.  

As stated in our Language Allocation Policy, approximately 5.4% of our students are in the ENL program, and many 
more of our students come from other-than-English speaking households, with a majority of these families 
speaking Spanish. Due to this data finding, our Parent Bulletins are always sent out in English and Spanish.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The Welcome Poster and Language ID guide will be posted at the entrances to the school and with the main office and 
security desk. We will provide parents with the information to locate the Parent's Bill of Rights, and Parent's Guide to 
Language Access. These documents will be displayed in the Parent Coordinator's office.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school utilizes the NYC DOE School survey, feedback from ELL parent workshops, as well as informal discussions 
with teachers and coordinators.
