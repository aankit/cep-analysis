Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school's mission is by the end of four years at MBA, our students will be empowered in all aspects of life with an 
emphasis on the business world. They will be able to collaborate and communicate effectively, appreciate multiple 
perspectives, solve problems, innovate, and reflect. Students will complete authentic performance tasks modeled on 
real world problems to demonstrate mastery of these skills.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
MBA is a small community committed to creating opportunities for students to experience the world around them as 
young entrepreneurs. Manhattan Business Academy is a limited un-screened school with 439 students where the 
population is composed of 65% Hispanic, 25% Black, 4% White and 3% Asian and 3% identify as others. Out of 420 
students, students with disabilities are 20% of the population, 7% are ELL and 70% live on or below the economic 
need index. The average incoming ELA and Math scores are 2.78 and 2.41 which are below the citywide average. 

Our curriculum includes a focus on business education as well as a strong Advisory program that allows students to 
form close relationships with our faculty members. Students demonstrate their understanding of subject material 
through portfolios and presentations at the end of every academic unit. After four years of academic instruction, 
Advisory and internships, our students graduate well-prepared to succeed in college and in their career. MBA has 3 
Buckets of learning that help the school achieve its mission; Caring for students as individuals, cultivating a love of 
learning and collaborating around college prep instruction. The teachers' schedule were designed to make sure that 
they have common planning time(department, grade team, ICT pairs, PBIS, Restorative Justice) embedded in their 
schedule. This allows the teachers to meet,discuss and continue to collaborate in improving students' performance in 
the school. 

MBA's 4-year graduation rate has been consistently in the upper 80% (85%) for the last four years and 89% for year 
graduation in 2017-2018 . The passing percentages for for the Common Core ELA Regents is 77% for Algebra is 65%, 
for Global History is 66%, for Us History is 75% and 70% for Living Environment. All the percentages mentioned 
showed declined in the overall average score for each test. 
 
The Quality Review for 2016-2017 indicates that Exceeding Expectations in Rigorous Instruction (4.58 out of 4.99) and 
Collaborative Teachers(4.09 out of 4.99) while Effective School Leadership (3.85), Trust (3.41) and Strong Family and 
Community Ties (3.09) are all Meeting Standards. 
 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

21% of our student have disabilities and they are in ICT classes for Math, Science, ELA and Social Studies. The school 
community is working together to further support the needs of the IEP students whether in designing curriculum, 
modifying lessons and projects and looking at student work. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The school strengths and accomplishments are: 

● Strong advisory program to support all students with a focus on our lowest third 

● Dedicated team of teachers organized by grade teams to discuss best instructional strategies weekly 

● 89% graduation rate  

● Career and Technical Education (CTE) certified school with a strong Virtual Enterprise program 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

● We have a College Coordinator from College Initiative 

● College Now class opportunities for students 

● Improvement of over all attendance to 90% 

The schools challenges include: 

- Creating a shared understanding of rigorous lessons and tasks as well as the elements of effective planning 

- Continuing to work on improving teachers capacity to design and implement rigorous lesson plans tasks aligned to 
content and CC standards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the High School Quality Snapshot 2017-2018, 39.4% of the students who graduate from Manhattan 
Business Academy are college-ready. This is made possible by the following initiatives at MBA:  

 

- A strong Advisory program that incorporates intensive college preparation. All students participate in a 4-year 
Advisory program which they get support in the following support: social emotional and academic. Advisory has a set 
curriculum in supporting the students in applying and preparing for college.  

- We partnered with College Bound Initiative that is a year round comprehensive college guidance program that works 
with students to ensure that they have access to and can afford a college education 

- We are a part of the NYC DOE initiative AP for all where students take challenging AP classes like Biology, Statistics 
and English. In the 2015 and 2016 7 students received 3 and above out of the 20 students who took it. 

- Students are expected to retake the Algebra and ELA Regents exam to get 80 and 75. Students do not need to take 
any remedial classes in CUNY if they received the scores mentioned. 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By the end of June 2019, MBA students graduating college ready will increase by 10%, by improving their skills in 
reading, writing and discussing as reflected by 1 point increase in MOSL overall score.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Inquiry groups during CPT (grade team meetings) will also be 
used to gauge whether or not progress is being made and what 
strategies prove to be the most effective in improving student 
performance. To assist students in improving writing skills, each 
teacher, except Mathematics and Physical Education teaches will 
require students to complete one piece of drafted writing per 
quarter. Teachers are encouraged to include low stakes writing 
into their daily lesson plans as well.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our Theory of Action for SY 2018-2019 is "If teachers utilize high level text during their lessons and increased their 
ability to differentiate support for high level content, then students will improve their scores on the ELA and Math 
Regents Exam " In order to ensure the students are achieving scores on the ELA and Algebra Regents exams to 
indicatre college readiness, we will provide teachers with small group, content based professional development, 
grade team critical friends group and school wide level PD to learn how to infuse high level text and critical thinking 
activities in their daily lessons.  

 

In the past, the instructional focus is " If we strengthen teachers understanding of rigorous questioning and discussion 
strategies, students will improve their speaking and listening skills (CC) which, in turn, will strengthen their writing 
skills." The strengths of the school are: 

 

Based from this focus, the school has the following success: 

1. Having a focused plan to ensure the teachers write measurable objectives 

2. Professional Development plan for the school year aligned to the Theory of Action 

3. Targeted PD for staff regarding leadership, content and strategy 

4. Meeting regularly with teacher teams, leaders, facilitators and APs 

5. Implementing Peer observations and lesson studies with a focus on student engagement and critical thinking 
activities. 

6. During random collection of lesson plans, all teachers had lesson plans available for review and feedback.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Manhattan Business Academy, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Manhattan Business Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional

 At MBA we believe that our ELL students will be able to succeed when provided the necessary 
supports both inside and outside of the classroom.  It is our goal to provide our ELL population 
with increased academic support outside the classroom as a supplement to the services we 
provide during the school day.  Teachers are able to provide more academic support coupled 
with language acquisition skills for the different content areas in English and Global.  The 
analysis of the data from Regents and the NYSESLAt showed that our ELLs need need addition 
support in reading and writing skills. Participants are in grades 9 to 12. Students will be grouped 
by grade and English language proficiency level. The majority of our ELLs are at Expending 
level.  
The school's supplemental Title III program consists of two major instructional activities that 
target ELL academic language development as and achievement in ELA and Global Studies . 
Our Title III program will consist of Global/ENL and ELA/ENL classes. Both ENL and content 
teachers in Title III program will plan and deliver instruction collaboratively.  Teachers will 
ensure that at least 50% of instruction for ELLs will be provided by certified ENL teachers. All 
of our 27 ELLs will be invited to participate in the program. The program will be co-taught by 
Global & ENL teachers and ELA & ENL teachers. It will be provided after school (Tuesday 
3:15-5:15) and Saturdays (10:00-12:00). The program will start on December 1 and run  through 
April 30 - a 12 week program.  
 Program budget allocation: $12,366.00. The program will run for 12 weeks, 2 days per week 
and 2 hours per day. Four teachers will receive per session compensation for the duration of the 
program ($60.65). This equates to $11,644.80. The remaining $721.20 will be used as follows:  
remaining $471.20 will be allocated to purchase instructional materials for ELLs in program 
(student journals, student binders, and ENL Scholastic materials). 
Other materials that are used for our  program are teacher-made, with graphic organizers, but 
they also implement the use of translation dictionaries provided by the school and the 
Department of Education website of resources for English Language Learners at no cost to Title 
III program.

Professional Development at MBA is ongoing in order to provide consistent support for our 
teachers. This will enable teachers to provide the best instruction possible to our English 
language Learners.  We believe in the importance of examining our students' work, especially for 
our ELL population, to ensure that they are making the necessary connections and transitions to

be successful.  Collectively we also examine our teaching practices that lend themselves toward 
greater student achievement and acquisition of the English language.  Topics we examine are 
how to provide effective strategies for language acquisition and the progress of our ELL 
population which informs changes that we might need to make to our instruction to become more 
effective educators.  However, in order to examine the best teaching practices in regard to 
English language acquisition, teacher observations are conducted.  In this way teachers are able 
to see what the best practices are as they are being used.      
The ENL teacher in Title III  will participate in MFSC ELL-focused professional  workshops, 
9am -2pm. The workshops will facilitate continuous learning among ENL educators, deepen 
their understanding and knowledge of policies and effective instructions. The first workshop, on 
12/4/18 is titled, "Scaffold interactive tasks in units."   The second workshop on 1/17/19 is titles 
"Bring it together: ENL co-teaching and  and standalone classroom."  The third workshop on 
2/4/19 is titles, " Share of learning -What is the impact of learning." ENL teachers will train all 
teachers participating in Title III to ensure best instructional approaches to support language 
development for ELLs. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as

Begin description here:            
MBA will conduct Title III parent engagement for ELL parents through a series of 3 workshops 
designed assist parents with accessing resources for ELLs and supporting their children's with 
academic and language development. The themes of the workshops have been identified based 
on ELLs performance on academic (MOSL, Regents) and language assessments (NYSESLAT), 
as well as through surveying ELL parents during parental outreach. The first workshop  on 
January 23rd 2019 will be dedicated to helping ELL parents to navigate and access ELL-related 
resources available in New York City. The second workshop on March 27th 2019 will provide 
ELL parents will resources to help their children on their way to college. The third workshop on 
April 17th 2019 will focus on providing ELL parents with resources to successfully prepare for 
high stakes tests.  All workshops will be designed and conducted by ENL teachers. All 
workshops will be scheduled for 4:00pm - 5:00pm. Parents will be invited via letter sent home in 
parents' home language. Translation and interpretation will be provided.  During workshops, 
ELL parents will receive instructional material and information on how to access ELL-related 
resources. The ELL parents will fill out surveys to assess their perception of the efficacy of the 
workshops. Also, the ELL parents will be provided with refreshments. Parent engagement will 
be at no cost to Title III. Up to  $250.00 will be allocated for ELL parent refreshments during 
the  workshops.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At MBA we formally assess students writing and reading ability in the first weeks of school using our DYO assessments and 
MOSL scores.  We also assess using the English baseling tests provided by the city.  The data has shown that our ELLs still 
struggle with reading (non-fiction texts especially).  The comprehension of text is often associated with a more limited 
vocabulary.  Leadership facilitates professional development centered around using data to inform our instruction.  Teachers 
then use the PD and the data to write unit and lesson plans to support our ELL students and all of our students. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

MBA evaluates the success of our ELL program in our Leadership meetings where the ELL team and the Leadership team 
reviews the data and creates interventions and strategies to support our ELL students.  These intervention strategies include 
Writing Across the Curriculum.      
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data reveals that our students 68% of the ELLstudents got Espanding on the NYSESLAT test.  From this data we know that 
we need to increase our literacy instruction which is why our focus for PD is "Writing Across the Curriculum".  Our students 
typically perform well on the listening and speaking, but struggle in reading and writing.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

BA implements a Freestanding English as a Second Language (ESL) Program. The primary goal of the program is to 
assist students in achieving English Language proficiency within three years.  The specific goals of MBA’s ESL program 
are:  
•To amplify the literacy and academic skills of ELLs who participate in the program  
•To incorporate recognized and researched based ESL instructional strategies across content subject areas.  
•To give students the skills to perform at city and state grade level in all subject areas 
a. Organizational models that are implemented include ICT (Integrated Collaborative Teaching), a push in model 
where our ELL teacher works with our ELA teacher for a double period everyday to support our ESL students’ 
literacy.  Our ESL students are also in one self-contained class with our ESL teacher to supplement the work they do in 
content classes. Through these supports we are able to provide our identified ELLs with a smaller teacher-student 
ratio and language support. 
  
b. The program models that are implemented in our school include block scheduling where the students are 
heterogeneously separated into strands.  Each strand travels together as a group throughout the day in all subject 
areas.  In math the strands get smaller as the strand is divided into a homogenous split.   
  
The goal of our ESL program is to foster full English proficiency in a supportive classroom environment. Both the ELA 
and ESL teachers that work with our ELL in the ESL program are fully certified. In order to help students to progress, 
we utilize the following practices:  
•Collaborative planning between ESL and ELA teachers for each unit.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

•Scaffolding is an essential part of the instructional delivery, such as Modeling, Bridging, Schema Building, 
Contextualization, Text Representation and Metacognition.  
•Assisting students during work periods, Conferencing with students in and out of class, informal assessments, and 
running records.  
•Additional small group AIS sessions for each grade prior to all state assessments, to focus on literacy and academic 
language.

Paste response to questions here:    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              .  In the Freestanding ESL component we have 36 students. They range from upper Intermediate to Advanced 
Proficiency levels. They all attend 360 minutes of ELA a week. Depending on their proficiency level, they receive from 500 
minutes to 550 minutes a week of English instruction a week including 395 minutes of English instruction with an ESL certified 
teacher.  These students are also taking Native Language Arts in Spanish for 240 minutes a week.  
    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Beyond explicit ESL, collaboration between teachers means that there is a consideration for the language needs of 
ELLs. Some aspects of this policy include:  
•Content area teachers monitor the understanding of linguistically challenging material and use a variety of phrasings and 
synonyms to clarify meaning.   Content teachers meet with our ELL teacher to review instructional strategies that best serve 
our ELL population.  Content teachers use graphic organizers and other strategies to make information clear to our ELL 
students.  
•To differentiate instruction for ELL students, Math teachers devote extra class time to untangling difficult word problems, and 
require students to make verbal explanations of the problems they work on.  
•To differentiate instruction for ELL students, Social Studies teachers scaffold their instruction with visual aids such as maps, 
atlases, and illustrations to increase comprehension.  
  
MBA ELL’s are in a small group daily advisory to continue strengthening their literacy and academic skills as well as address 
students emotional needs. There are 9 ELL students in advisory with one ESL certified teacher.   
  
All students, including ELL students, have two periods of English a day.  In both classes we focus on strengthening the students 
literacy skills and provide students with time to read individually and with a small group.  An ESL teacher is providing the 
instruction and utilizing researched ESL literacy strategies to improve ELL and Non-ELL literacy. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                4.  In order to ensure that ELLs are properly evaluated in their native language, content area tests are translated 
and/or ordered in their native language 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

.  MBA's ELL's labeled SIFE are assessed using the NYSESLAT test, the Periodic Assessments, and teachers diagnostic and 
summative assessments.  From there, we create instructional plans for students to increase our ELL's achievement in reading 
and writing, where they have scored the lowest on the NYSESLAT test.  These students also have two teachers in their classes 
to provide a lower student - teacher ratio to give them more personalized attention.  
  
b.  When a new student is registered in our school, we provide the following resources to facilitate the transition.  
• An informal student orientation  
• Buddy system identifying a similar student in his/her class that will assist during the day  
• Encourage student to participate in the After School activities.  
• An informal assessment is provided to identify possible Academic Intervention programs.  
• Home school communication.  
  
c.  MBA ELL's that have received services for 4 - 6 years are assessed using the NYSESLAT test, the Periodic Assessments, and 
teachers diagnostic and summative assessments.  From there, we create instructional plans for students to increase our ELL's 
achievement in reading and writing, where they have scored the lowest on the NYSESLAT test.  We ensure that ever ELL 
students receives the correct amount of mandated minutes.  At MBA ELL students receive more than their mandated minutes. 
  
d.   MBA ELL's that have received services for over 6 years are assessed using the NYSESLAT test, the Periodic Assessments, and 
teachers diagnostic and summative assessments.  From there, we create instructional plans for students to increase our ELL's 
achievement in reading and writing, where they have scored the lowest on the NYSESLAT test.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At MBA we use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least 
restrictive environment in a few ways.  Within scheduling we have allotted time for teachers to be able to provide tutoring for 
students during the day who might be struggling in math.  ELA is also taught in double block periods.  Aside from ESL teachers 
having the ability to pull students out or push in, collaborative teachers are also able to pull students out to create a smaller 
teacher-student ratio.  These options also provide greater flexibility for curricular and instructional flexibility as it allows 
teachers to re-teach any lessons or go into greater depth and analysis of topics/concepts students might be struggling with.       
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment?

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students receive a double block of English with a push in ELL teacher in the 9th grade. This class is a freestanding immersion 
ELL  
class where all students are reading independently for 30 minutes with leveled books. The last hour and a half, teachers target 
instruction centering around effective reading and writing strategies using scaffolded differentiated lessons. Our 10th grade 
ELL students have a small instruction class of 12 students four times a week with our ELL teacher. In Math and other content 
areas, our teacher differentiate their instruction using graphic organizers, visual aids and audio support to assist our ELL 
students. Students also receive supplementary support in their advisory and in our after school programs when necessary.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Next year will depend on the size of our ELL population.

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building.

content areas, enrichment programs and after school clubs. 
     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

For foreign Language classes students are placed in their native language.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 In each grade level, students actually receive more than the required number of minutes in ESL for the multiple levels.  In each 
grade, students receive 2 hours of ESL instruction daily.  They receive push in instruction and the ESL teachers are able to work 
with them individually or in groups.  The ESL teachers are also able to plan with content area teachers to help them plan for 
the needs of ESL students.  Instructionally, we also include English translation dictionaries and translated copies of any texts 
that are exceptionally difficult for students to understand. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the school year begins, activities that are provided to assist newly enrolled ELL students include an orientation where 
they have the opportunity to meet with the ESL teachers and content area teachers.  They are also provided with important 
vocabulary that they are required to know for the first quarter.  This way as they begin the school year they have a working 
knowledge of vocabulary to help them through the first few months.  Throughout the school year teachers employ similar 
strategies with vocabulary.  Newly enrolled ESL students are also buddied with ESL students who have been with us 
longer.  They also work in the same advisories for social and emotional support as well.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Karen Polsonetti, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
