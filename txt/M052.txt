Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our vision is to inspire all students, parents and educators to become active and reflective participants in a 
community of learners. We aim to provide a safe and nurturing environment that empowers students to become 
responsible citizens. Through meaningful collaboration and the purposeful use of technology, students will develop 
the skills necessary to engage in a demanding and ever changing global society.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Harold O. Levy a middle school with 262 students across grades 6, 7 and 8. The student population comprises of 95% 
Hispanic, 3% Black, 1% White and 1% other students. 44% of students are English Language Learners (ELLs) and 25% 
are special education students. Boys account for 52% of the population enrolled and girls account for 48%. The 
average attendance rate for the 2017-18 school year was 94.4%. 

To ensure our students are receiving the best education possible, we ensure there are ongoing opportunities for our 
school community members to collaborate and feel supported, no matter their role. To better serve our teachers, we 
are part of several DOE-initiatives aimed at developing and elevating their instructional practices and leadership skills, 
both in and out of the classroom. One initiative includes the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) Program. Under TIF, our 
school has 1 Peer Collaborative Teachers (PCTs) and 1 Model Teacher (MT). Together, this team works to: 

· develop as leaders by planning & facilitating learning activities for their colleagues; 

· support colleagues to improve instructional practices and student learning aligned to Framework for Teaching; 

· serve as a laboratory/model classroom as a resource for colleagues.  

 

Another initiative is the District Charter Collaborative (DCC). Under DCC, we have a team of teachers that will work 
with a mix of public and charter schools on a learning focus area. The purpose of this team’s work is to: 

· develop inter-school collaborative learning opportunities; 

· build capacity to share best practices and strengthen existing ones; 

· support teacher growth & leadership.  

 

The work of each of these initiatives is also aligned to our school’s instructional focus: Formative Assessment to 
Support Student Learning. We aim to ensure that lessons include thoughtfully planned assessments that are aligned 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

to learning outcomes and activities and provide teachers with information to adjust instruction to support student 
needs, as necessary.  

 

To support our parents, out Parent Coordinator organizes monthly parent workshops to build relationships with and 
foster communication between the school and our students’ home. In these meetings, we will share pertinent 
information with parents relating to curriculum & instruction, safety and Chancellor’s Regulations. Topics of 
discussion include, but are not limited to: NY State exams, high school application process, and adolescent 
development. Essentially, our collaboration with parents intends to build a mutually supportive environment that 
reinforces high expectations of academic success and strengthens ties between community and school.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

As students enter the Harold O. Levy School 52, they are not only beginning their middle school careers, but are also 
embarking on a period of complex personal transformation. Our ENL students face the additional challenge of 
navigating these changes in a new environment while learning a new language. Given that 28% of our population are 
ENLs and 37% are former ENLs, attending to the needs of our second language population is a priority area for us at 
Harold O. Levy 52. Each year, we analyze the data from state exams and diagnostic assessments to uncover specific 
student needs that will help us to support them in meeting both language and content objectives throughout the 
year.  

 

One support is the creation of ENL units. The unit topic is: Immigrant/Migrant Stories and Experiences and its purpose 
is to provide students the opportunity to connect their own experiences with those of other cultures. Readings focus 
on cultural identity, immigration, gender roles and assimilation. Essentially these units provide students with the 
opportunity to develop their English skills across modalities using concepts with which they are familiar. 

 

Another support for our ENL population is programming. All students in the Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) 
program are programmed into 1 of 3 ungraded ESL classes: newly arrived/Entering proficiency level, Emerging 
proficiency level, and Transitioning proficiency level. NYSESLAT scores, Home Language Identification Survey and the 
New York State Identification Test determine the level of proficiency of the students. The purpose of the ungraded 
classes is to provide support to students learning English at their level.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In the past year, we have made significant progress in 2 key elements of the Framework for Great Schools: Supportive 
Environment and Collaborative Teachers . As evidenced by our Quality Review, we have instilled structures and 
systems that support a culture of high expectations and collaboration among staff and families to ensure their 
understanding of and accountability for expectations, especially those linked to the Common Core Learning 
Standards. Further, school leaders consistently communicate high expectations to all staff members and these school-
wide expectations are not only aligned to one another, but also to the Danielson Framework for Teaching. In addition, 
families are provided with information about expectations for their children and supported in learning how to help 
their children succeed in meeting these expectations. We plan to continue refining this strength to ensure that our 
school maintains a positive tone and is a place where collaboration, community involvement and academic 
achievement are interdependent and valued.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

 

Moving forward, our key focus area for this year is Rigorous Instruction . While we have solid curricula across 
departments, we must ensure that what was designed within each unit is implemented in the classroom in a way that 
challenges student thinking. Our Professional Learning Plan (PLP) was designed with this in mind: to support teachers

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: 

As evidenced by our most recent QR (2016-17) & PPO Feedback (2017-2018): 

Curriculum is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and academic tasks emphasize rigorous habits and 
higher-order skills. CCLS-aligned lessons and units are coherent across grades providing for a consistent experience for 
students as they move through the school. Opportunities to develop higher-order skills are also evident across the 
curriculum in all grades and subjects.  

Teaching practices are aligned to the school’s belief that students learn best when they are involved in discussions. 
This is evident across classrooms as students engage in interactive lessons that promote dialogue and participation so 
that all learners can produce meaningful work products and have the opportunity to demonstrate and deepen their 
higher-order thinking skills. 

Teaching strategies provide multiple entry points for students to engage in tasks that demonstrate higher-order 
thinking skills. 

School goals are aligned with school needs and are addressed through our professional learning plan.  

Teachers are engaged in ongoing professional learning activities that include weekly PLC meetings (3x per week by 
content), weekly professional development during Monday 80 minutes PD time, and cycles of interclass visitations.  

 

NEED: 

According 2017 -2018 PPO feedback next steps, we need to, "Ensure the consistency of instructional expectations, 
such as providing student actionable feedback and differentiation meets the needs of all learners." 

In order to achieve we must focus on ensuring teachers regularly check for understanding within their lessons and 
adjust their teaching according to the needs of their learners. We will utilize professional learning time to support 
teachers in learning how to use data to inform instruction to differentiate their instruction and provide meaningful, 
actionable feedback to students.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
To improve student performance in mathematics by June 2019, students in grades 6-8 will show progress in 
Mathematics indicated by a 10% decrease of level 1 students on the 2019 State Math Assessments. Math level 1 
students will decrease from 57% in 2018 to 47% in 2019.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths: 

As evidenced by our most recent QR (2016-17) & PPO Feedback (2016-17): 

 

School leaders and staff consistently communicate high expectations to students and their families. There is a culture 
for learning and students are being prepared for the next level. In addition, families understand student progress 
towards high expectations and families and faculty support students as they work towards achieving those 
expectations. 

 

PLC time is utilized to support the academic growth of students and teachers continue to engage in cycles of 
professional learning focused on improving pedagogical skills.  

 

NEED: 

According to 2016-17 QR feedback, although there are many supports available to help students academically, we 
need to provide additional social-emotional supports to students. We believe it will not only improve their academic 
abilities, but also create a more positive school culture by allowing greater student voice in decision-making, as well as 
increase attendance.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 the Harold O. Levy School 52 will improve school culture and foster a healthy and supportive 
environment for students & teachers with a focus on training teachers on how to support students when they are 
upset. This will be measured by an increase of students who agree with the statement that "teachers support them 
when they are upset, (Q3e)" from 63% in 2018 to 73% in 2019, on the NYC school survey.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

As a staff, we will establish a culture for learning that 
communicates high expectations for all and support to meet 
goals & expectations through PLC meetings. The advisory 
program overview will be shared, explained, and connected to 
our school culture on the first PD Day and training will be 
provided at weekly grade-level PLC meetings. The advisory team 
will review protocols and supports for dealing with students who 
have behavioral or emotional escalations. 

Advisory for Students: Students will engage in learning about 
self-awareness, self-regulation and their ability to articulate 
positive plans for their future. They will also learn how to 
contribute to a positive school environment by developing better 
communication and team-building skills.  

Leadership Training for Students: Selected students will engage 
in learning about leadership, team-building skills and increase 
their self-awareness through the Ambassadors Program.  

By the end of February 2019, a school-wide survey on school 
environment will be distributed to students. At least 78% of all 
teachers will demonstrate positive responses on receiving 
supports for the social-emotional section in the NYC School 
Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

STRENGTHS: 

As evidenced by our most recent QR (2016-17) & PPO Feedback (2016-17): 

 

The school prioritizes teacher collaboration as a driving force behind improving instruction.  

Therefore, all teachers are programmed to participate in 4 PLC meetings per week: 3 content level and 1 grade-level.  

The first PLC meeting of the year introduces teachers to the instructional focus and the school-wide goals.  

All subsequent meetings are aligned to these outcomes. 

 

Each PLC has a facilitator to guide the team through the day’s agenda and manage time, and a recorder to capture the 
minutes. All PLC meetings follow a clear structure: 1) review minutes from the previous meeting; 2) address/discuss 
new items on the agenda for that day; 3) identify immediate concerns or requests for support from administrators; 
and 4) create the agenda for the next meeting. 

 
Content-level PLCs focus on instruction and academic work, such as analyzing student data, collaborative lesson 
planning, and refining units of study. Grade-Level PLCs focus on social-emotional learning and support, such as 
improving classroom culture, increasing attendance, and promoting positive behaviors and opportunities for student 
collaboration.  

 

The school is also a member of the NYC DOE’s Learning Partners Program (LPP). Through this initiative, our selected 
LPP team has the opportunity to regularly collaborative with other schools in the program to share best practices and 
solve common problems. The team both hosts and attends visits with their partner schools and the 
learning/information gained during visits is shared with the Harold O. Levy 52 staff during PLC meetings.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          23 

 

Further, this initiative affords the school 2 Model Teacher positions. Model Teachers use their classrooms to serve as 
lab classrooms to support the professional growth of their colleagues and are utilized as a resource to demonstrate 
effective teaching practices. 

 

NEED 

Although we have made improvements in pedagogy, our 2016-17 QR & 2017-2018 PPO Feedback, as well as findings 
recorded in ADVANCE, indicate that the school must continue to focus on pedagogy. Therefore, we plan to use our 
structures for collaboration to ensure teachers use shared time to analyze student data and use it to plan lessons 
together. Specifically, the focus will be on alignment between learning outcomes, activities and assessments within 
the lesson.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate in peer collaboration by participating in at least two cycles of lesson labs. 
We will measure success of this initiative through peer feedback in PLC meetings, professional development workshops, 
inter-visitations, and also through increased performance on their teacher observations in the Advance system.

MATH PLC Meeting: The math coach will lead math content 
meetings three times per week for all teachers. Focus areas 
include: Data Analysis, Collaborative Planning, & Pedagogical 
Practices. Essentially teachers work together to plan lessons, 
analyze data & use it to inform instruction, and strengthen their 
pedagogical practices. They will also conduct inter-class visits & 
use content meetings to debrief the lessons.  

Lesson Lab PD: Teachers will work in small teams to 
collaboratively plan a lesson. First, teams will focus on 
understanding & identifying the components of a quality lesson, 
followed by designing a lesson that includes clear objectives, 
activities & assessments aligned to that objective, opportunities 
for student collaboration, and meaningful work products. 
Teachers will visit one another during the lesson & take low-
inference notes on what is seen/heard. Teams then look at 
student work products together and engage in professional 
conversation focused on instructional practices and student 
learning.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

As evidenced by our most recent QR (2016-17) & PPO Feedback (2017-18): 

 

The school has made significant improvements in pedagogy within the past year. Teaching practices are aligned to the 
school’s belief that students learn best when they are involved in hands-on work and student-to-student discussions. 
Teachers implement protocols for discussions and provide multiple entry points for students to engage in tasks that 
demonstrate higher-order thinking skills. Students actively engage with their reading and writing using consistent 
approaches across the school.  

 

Teachers develop learning targets for students after an analysis of baseline data, in order to address the learning 
needs of individual students. Data meetings are held three times per year with teachers and an administrator to 
discuss and monitor ongoing progress of the students. Students are also learning to self- assess using task specific 
rubrics presented by teachers. In addition, the school ensures: 

  Ongoing professional development is offered during grade and content meetings, as well as Monday 

afternoon PD.  

  Professional learning is aligned to our school’s instructional focus. 
  Professional learning is aligned to observation feedback and specific to the overall needs of our school (e.g., 

feedback received through student data, Quality Review, etc.) 

  Teacher participation in various initiatives to support improving instructional practices. Initiatives include the 

 

Learning Partners Program (LPP) and the Apple Grant.  
Leadership PD/opportunities exist through LPP participation and teachers receive specific and ongoing PD on 
how to develop their leadership skills in order to support their colleagues’ professional growth.  

Need: 

Although we have made improvements in pedagogy, our 2016-17 QR & PPO Feedback, as well as findings recorded in 
ADVANCE, indicate that the school must continue to focus on pedagogy – particularly the ways in which we use 
assessments and data to inform instruction and support student learning.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          28 

 

Therefore, we will customize our professional learning plan to support this need and strengthen this area through 
targeted professional development opportunities, ongoing observations, and by providing clear and actionable 
feedback.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will have participated in at least 3 cycles of professional learning focused on using 
formative assessment to support student learning which will result in 90% of all teachers achieving a minimum rating of 
“Effective” dimension 3D – Using Assessment in Instruction on the Danielson framework.

Strengths 

 

As evidenced by our most recent QR feedback, parents reported that the school has an open door policy and that 
they receive a lot of communication regarding their children’s progress and expectations for the grade, through 
monthly meetings with the principal and ongoing meetings with teachers. In addition, parents shared that the 
principal has facilitated workshops for them on the Common Core Learning Standards and the new state assessments, 
and provided them with a syllabus and handbook that further communicate the school’s high expectations for their 
children.  

In addition: 

  Teachers send home progress reports at the mid-way point of each marking period to keep parents informed 

of their child’s performance and progress in each subject. 

  Teachers use Tuesday afternoons to conduct parent outreach, such as phone calls, emails, letters, one-to-one 

meetings, etc. to share pertinent information with parents. 

  Teachers use the month of September to administer and analyze diagnostic assessments in each subject area. 
They look at this data against summative test data and share the information with colleagues in PLC meetings. 
This data helps to create a more clear picture about each child and helps teachers create student groups for 
class work and informs instruction.  

  Parent Coordinator conducts monthly workshops to inform parents of current units of study in each grade 

and subject areas, upcoming exams, and ways to support students at home.  

  Teachers, the Advisor & the Guidance Counselor hold parent workshops covering a range of topics to provide 

information on and address concerns over both academic and social-emotional issues. They also share 
resources available to parents and students outside of the school.  

 

NEED: 

The priority need is to see increased parent attendance at conferences and workshops.

Section 7: Support for Students in Temporary Housing (STH)  

 

Directions: 
-  All Title I schools must complete Part A of this section. 
-  All Non-Title I schools must complete Part B of this section. 
 
Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.)

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

We purchase backpacks for our STH population and fill them with school supplies they will need for the year, such as 
pens, pencils, colored pencils, graph paper, notebooks, and binders. We also purchase gym uniforms for these 
students, as well.  

 

After-school tutoring is available in the specific content areas in which students need support. Tutoring is conducted 
in small groups (6-8 students) to provide individualized support and focused instruction in the student’s areas for 
improvement.  

 

In addition, students are closely followed by counselors and are offered a wide range of support, ranging from 
individual and/or group counseling services, support for families, and a connection to outside social agencies, where 
necessary.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

Teacher recruitment is conducted based on the needs of the school. In order to find qualified candidates, we attend 
job fairs and reach out to the Teaching Fellows program. Teacher assignments are determined by student needs and 
teacher license area(s). Further, our school is currently working with the New York City Teaching Academy (NYCTA), a 
program that allows us to host student teachers and Teaching Fellows. 

 

Approximately 90% of our staff are highly qualified teachers (HQT). In addition, we also have a high rate of retention 
of highly qualified teachers. However, teachers not considered highly qualified are supported in meeting this 
distinction by making available to them Title I funds to earn the additional education credits necessary to become 
highly qualified. We also offer them support to become National Board Certified teachers. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our high retention rate of highly qualified teachers can be attributed to the ongoing, differentiated PD opportunities 
provided to all our teachers specific to their content areas. We first lay the foundation for the year through training 
on the overall mission and vision of our school, annual goals, citywide instructional expectations, the CCLS, staff 
manual revisions, and various procedures & protocols that must be followed, including formal and informal 
observations, visitations, and teacher-team expectations. We then provide differentiated PD to teachers that focus on 
their specific areas for improvement. All topics are aligned to our instructional focus, Formative Assessment to 
Support Student Learning, and they include: Utilizing Checks for Understanding, Supporting ELL students, and Data-
Driven Instruction. These topics were selected as areas for improvement based on observations, inter-class visitation 
feedback, and teacher reflections. Teacher leaders also receive professional development through the District Charter 
Collaborative (DCC) to improve their facilitation & leadership skills.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

Paraprofessionals attend the same in-school professional development as teachers, particularly when it is focused on 
topics related to the Instructional Core (e.g., understanding and planning for Common Core Standards, engaging 
students in learning, differentiating tasks to meet student needs, etc.). Further, our IEP Teacher provides ongoing PD 
to paraprofessionals on understanding IEPs: how to access SESIS, understanding the PLOP, and staying focused on IEP 
goals and the social-emotional and academic needs of students in classrooms.  

 

The principal and assistant principals attend monthly district-wide PD in role-alike groups led by the Superintendent 
and his team. PD is focused on improving the instructional practices of our teachers through conducting regular 
classroom observations, providing timely feedback (both written and verbal) with specific next steps & follow-up 
support, and differentiating PD to meet teacher needs.  

 

The district also organizes principals into learning pods - teams of principals that regularly visit one another’s schools 
to see best practices in action and problem-solve around common needs.  

 

Further, our administrative team meets regularly to discuss our school’s strengths and areas for improvement and to 
engage in book club-style discussions focused around articles & books on topics specific to our needs.  

 

Finally, our participation in the Learning Partners Program provides an additional layer of support for school leaders. 
Administrators and teacher leaders work with other schools within the LPP Quad to share best practices and problem-
solve around common needs.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teams of teachers collaborated to revise performance tasks within each grade level and subject area and to plan 
necessary scaffolds for various subgroups of students. Teachers were supported in this work through ongoing PD with 
our consultant, Assessment Matters. Further, a small group of literacy teachers worked together to create a set of 
school-wide rubrics to assess student writing across grades and content areas. Teachers provided PD to their 
colleagues on using the rubric to effectively provide feedback to students so that they may improve their own writing 
and the rubrics have been revised using teacher feedback over time. Assessment Matters team also provided 
additional PD on how to provide effective feedback to students. Finally, teachers have been working together to 
design baseline assessments within each grade and content area. They will be revised throughout the school year. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs.

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Harold O. Levy School 52, in compliance with the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and 
support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents 
informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. 
Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Harold O. Levy School 52 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the 
Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing 
technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills; 

  maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office; 
conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

 

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right

Caucasian, and 1.2% other groups of students. The student body includes 122 - 47% English language 
learners, which is a higher proportion of students than is usual in similar schools. The Harold O. Levy 
School 52 serves all types of students, from native English speakers, to special education students, to English 
Language Learners who are recent immigrants or newcomers.  Although the school has a diverse 
environment, a large amount of the school population belongs to students who come from a 
Latino/Hispanic background. 
     The Title III program is a bilingual program designed to increase ELLs, particularly current ELLs at the 
entering, emerging, and transitioning level, English proficiency and academic achievement in the core subject 
areas of Math and Science. The core subject areas will be provided in their Home Language.  The Saturday 
Academy lessons will reflect curriculum materials and approaches that are designed to provide ELL students 
acquisition of listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in the second language. This includes non-
fiction texts, audio and visual texts and materials, hand-on experiences, and the use of manipulative in 
math/science. Therefore, materials used for the program are of no cost to Title III program. The purpose of 
this plan is to create a situation where there is reason, opportunity and purpose for using language. This 
includes but is not limited to:  the development of vocabulary, language development skills in the four 
modalities as well as fractions, number theory, interpretation of charts and graphs, using measurement, 
solving algebraic equations / expressions and problem solving activities. 
      As we analyze the ELLs data we came to the conclusion that there are considerable challenges for English 
language learners in the English language as well as in math. In math, we found that our ELLs use different 
processes to arrive at answers and that they struggle decoding word problems. Problem solving is not just 
language, but a thought process as well. On the other hand, in the English language ELLs struggle with 
vocabulary and understanding written academic language. According to the 2017-2018 State Tests Scores, 
most of our current ELLs did not make progress in the Math and ELA State Test, and although there was 
growth in the NYSESLAT, the growth was noted within the same language proficiency levels, not up from 
one level to the other. Based on the NYSELAT/NYSITELL data, we have 122 current ELLs across grades; 
28 are at the entering level, 11 are at the emerging level, 30 at the transitioning level, and 53 in the 
expanding level. There is a total of 30 students that moved up a level of language proficiency, 5 students 
that moved up two levels, and 27 that made growth within that same level. However, there are approximately 
28 students that went down within the same level. Based on the 2017-18 NYS ELA Exam data, out of 94 
ELL students that were tested, 76% of our ELL students are at a level 1 and 19% at a level 2. For the NYS 
math exam, out of 106 ELL students that were tested, 75% of our ELL students are at a level 1 and 22% at a 
level 2. After analyzing the data from the NYSESLAT as well as from the ELA and math exams, the 
rationale for the Title III program is to give extra support to students in grades 6-8 in math in their native 
language / English according to their proficiency level and English language acquisition.    
     In the Saturday Academy Title III program, there will be approximately 40 targeted current ELL students 
expected to participate. The grade levels that will be attending are 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. We will measure 
increases in English proficiency and core academic content knowledge of limited English proficient children 
with the NYSESLAT and NYS Math and science tests. The English language proficiency levels will be

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
entering, emerging, transitional and expanding according to latest NYSESLAT scores. As mentioned above, 
the program is designed to support and enhance students' academically in the areas of literacy (language 
development) and Math/Science. 
     The classes will total 3 hrs. on Saturdays from 9:00 am – 12:00 pm.  There will be equal time for math and 
ENL (15 sessions are planned).  There are a total four groups - with approximately 15:1 ratio in each 
group.  Students will be divided into 4 groups: 6th and 7th grade Beginners, 6th and 7th Intermediate, 8th 
grade beginners, and 8th grade intermediate. The certified TESOL / bilingual teachers will take one group 
each and alternate then switch with the content teachers after 1.5 hours. This will allow for all students 
attending the program to benefit from an additional exposure to ENL methodologies and grade level 
mathematics/science. . 
      Number of teachers participating: Four teachers will provide instruction to students and one supervisor. 
SAM # 53 clearly states that Title III teachers should be have a bilingual extension or TESOL license. Every 
attempt will be made and positions will be posted to fill them according to the regulations. The program 
supervisor will be Mr. Luis Tejada.  There are no other programs that have a supervisor during those 
times.  However, the PD hours will be conducted on Wednesdays and Thursdays  from 2:20 pm – 3:20 pm 
since the supervisor’s hours are 7:30 am – 3:20 pm, Monday thru Friday, hence no funds will be necessary 
from Title III to pay him. All postings will be done as per the UFT contract. Title III activities will start on 
October 13, 2018 to March 9, 2019. 
Materials used are as follows: 
ENL: Language Power Level A and B workbooks, grade level readings from Readworks.org and Newsela, 
and teacher handouts.  Math - Glance Skills Intervention for Middle School Mathematics, teacher made 
materials, Math handbook Glencoe McGraw-Hill in Spanish, Envision Textbook in Spanish, and teacher 
hand-outs. 
      The support staff (supervisor) that will be working with the program will have a number of duties. They 
will be responsible for the maintenance and updating of attendance logs. They also have the responsibility to 
make phone calls to the families of students who are not attending, are absent, or cutting.    <!--

Title of workshop: Using ENL approaches and strategies in the content areas 
Presenter: Vanessa Gil 
Participants: Maria Rojas, Luis Tejada, Maximo Cabral and Neurys Fernandez 
     Our high-quality professional development activities are aligned to the instructional program being 
delivered under the Title III program. Ms. Vanessa Gil will facilitate the aforementioned PD sessions.  Mr. 
Tejada, the assistant principal, will support the teachers in the area of data management: gathering, analyzing 
& interpreting data. Teachers will learn to evaluate students through various formative assessments, to use the 
data gained to inform their instruction, and to monitor students throughout the duration of the Title III 
program. 
     Professional development will also include cutting edge professional articles approaches and strategies in 
teaching ELLs. These articles will provide the teachers with an opportunity to further their knowledge of 
current practices, and discussing, analyzing and applying new insights into classroom practices. The 
participants will share this information with the entire staff in our continuing efforts to incorporate language 
development into all the content areas. It is expected that this will have a positive impact on our ELL 
population which is almost 2/3 of our student body population.

Begin description here:            
Parental involvement holds a radical value and importance to the academic development of children in our 
schools.  Based on our school’s mission parental involvement is considered to be a necessary component in a 
child’s educational success. An invitation letter will be sent to parents informing them of the program that 
will be conducted under Title III. Parents will also be asked to attend a workshop during school hours where 
they will have the opportunity to learn about the program expectations, understand the value of the school and 
them working together to further the acquisition of the new language and also share their ideas and concerns. 
The targeted number of parents attending the workshop is 40. The language of service is Spanish. The 
elements of the curriculum will be explained so they can help their children at home and compliment the 
work these students do during school hours. This training will help parents to build capacity in order to 
increase their children’s academic performance. We will also be having workshops on how to use the Internet 
in helping their children with homework and how to access school information.<!--

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At The Harold O. Levy School 52, teachers use a variety of formative assessments and curriculum-embedded assessments to 
guide instructional planning for all of our students. Students are assessed throughout the school year using a combination of 
previously released New York State English Language Arts testing materials, Baseline Assessments also known as the 
Performance Series, teacher-created writing diagnostics, and curriculum-embedded assessments: particularly performance 
and summative tasks. Formative assessments are typically supplemented by teacher-developed evidence graphic organizers 
and scaffolding activities used to prepare ELLs for the aforementioned performance and summative tasks. The writing 
diagnostics were developed by a team of teachers to assess the degree to which students mastered the previous grades' 
Common Core Reading and Writing standards as well as student readiness to engage in current grade-level work. In addition, 
the writing diagnostics were created to align to topics related to the first units in each grade. All ELLs are assessed using a 
common form of diagnostics given to every other student. Teachers also informally monitor speaking and listening skills via 
whole class, small group, and pair discussions by using a conference log. Furthermore, for our ELLs in particular, we use the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

previous year’s NYSESLAT modality scores while the newcomer ELL students additionally use the NYSITELL scores to guide the 
development of units, instructional planning and supports based on students’ needs. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To support the instructional planning for the ELLs, our ENL and bilingual teachers meet regularly and work collaboratively 
during Monday afternoon professional development time and three-weekly PLC (Professional Learning Community) Meetings 
and grade level meetings. During these allotted times of collaboration, teachers review ELL data and collaboratively plan 
instruction for their students. Part of this collaboration involves closely exploring our common units and creating and adapting 
lessons from them to address the needs of our ELLs, in response to their proficiency levels. Likewise, teachers work together to 
plan instruction that is appropriately scaffolded and differentiated for their ELLs and helps them to bridge their home language 
knowledge and skills with the new language across content areas. ENL and bilingual teachers visit other content area teachers 
to offer them contextualization, bridging, scaffolding, and differentiation strategies to better support the needs and 
proficiency levels of their ELLs along with sharing a breadth of physical and digital resources to use in their own classrooms. 
 
In September, and subsequently updated in October, the Data Specialist provides all teachers with NYSESLAT and NYS exam 
scores so that teachers can determine the strengths and instructional needs of our ELLs. In these meetings, we use RLAT data 
aggregated by class for teachers to closely examine the aforementioned data. This data is collaboratively analyzed, and each 
teacher retains a copy of it for their data binders. Teachers examine whether or not there is an increase in overall proficiency 
for each student, and in cases where there is not, teachers examine modality scores to determine where students did and did 
not make progress. After disseminating the data, teachers plan instruction from the common units to engage ELLs in frequent 
opportunities to express their language ability and understanding in all modalities to fit their students’ needs. Teachers further 
collaborate to plan and examine student writing to look for patterns and trends in performance and apply it to their further 
planning and instruction. Also, during these meetings, teachers engage in the planning and reflection of teacher interclass 
visitations, and look at student work to determine writing strengths and needs, and plan intervention strategies. This year, as 
part of our professional development plan, teachers will work in problem-of-practice teams to research instructional issues, 
plan instruction to address the needs, engage in classroom visits to monitor progress, reflect upon their practice and revise 
strategies. All of this in-house professional learning is aligned to Danielson 3b and 3c.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At The Harold O. Levy School 52, we use a variety of summative and benchmark assessments to identify baseline, progress and 
the areas of need of our students. As a benchmark, teachers use the Performance Series assessment for both English Language 
Arts and Math three times throughout the school year to track the progress of our students. As a baseline, teachers use the 
previous years NYS ELA and Math tests to assess students progress and academic growth throughout the school year. ENL and 
Bilingual teachers use the previous year’s NYSESLAT modality scores and the NYSITELL scores as a tool to identify strengths and 
areas of need and are also used as a summative assessment at the end of year to track and compare students’ progress. We do 
not use the ELL Periodic Assessments, however we use the Summative Task at the end of each grade’s common units to keep 
track of ELL student progress. Other summative assessments used are the NYS ELA, Math and the Science Tests which are used 
to identify progress from previous years and for areas of need for the upcoming year. For Home Language Assessment (HLA), 
especially for Spanish speakers, teachers use the new Home Language periodic Assessment at the beginning and end-of-year 
and the Lab-R results to inform themselves of the students’ areas of need in their home language.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered and after analyzing the data and identifying the students’ areas of need, support 
and growth, we provide one-to-one cycle of tutoring to these students in particular as a form of intervention. Each cycle is six 
weeks and provides students with the opportunity to work more directly with the teacher to improve in their area/s of 
weakness. These students are also provided with Enrichment and Title III programs on Saturdays, which focused particularly on 
literacy skills and math development. Others interventions provided in the classrooms are small groups activities in which 
students can support each other, glossaries, dictionaries, text in their home language, and word walls that can be used as 
reference.

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Question not applicable.  The Harold O. Levy School 52 only serves students from 6th to 8th grade. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
To evaluate and inform our ELL programs we use a variety of assessment data such as the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and Math tests, 
the Algebra Regents, the Science State test, and student portfolios, including the performance and summative tasks developed 
throughout the year from each unit that accumulate over the course of their time at school 52. The result is a body of work 
that demonstrates their growth and achievement of both content understanding and language proficiency. We also use the 
ELL Data Analysis Tool, which helps determine the ELLs in the school and gives ideas of the strengths and weaknesses of the 
students. This tool also helps form the basis of the Title III Program. Also, teachers’ observation notes and conference sheets 
throughout the school year helps evaluate and inform our ELL programs.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

To disseminate the findings to make adjustments to our programs we meet with the school data specialist during the PLCs to 
discuss students’ data, groupings and classes. ENL and Bilingual teachers also meet during these meetings as a team to discuss 
the data and information gathered and revealed from the assessments.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our standalone ENL program consists of one class per grade. Each standalone ENL class is heterogeneously grouped 
and blocked, so the students mostly travel together. The only periods that they might not travel together for are their 
talent classes. We include our recently tested out ELLs (former ELLs) in the standalone ENL classes to ensure that the 
receive the appropriate support as per CR Part 154.2. Students in our standalone ENL program are taught using same 
common units as their general education peers. Some standalone ENL program students also receive integrated ENL 
support in their content classes.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our transitional bilingual program consists of one class per grade. Each TBE class is heterogeneously grouped and 
blocked, so the students mostly travel together. The only periods that they might not travel together for are their 
talent classes. Students in our TBE program are taught using same rigorous common units as the rest of their peers. 
This year in order to meet the needs of our ELLs, especially the newcomers, we have purchased the Language Power, 
Building Language Proficiency series to provide language support and skills development. We are aiming to continue a 
TBE leveled bridge class in 2018-2019 to help build foundational academic English and develop language skills. For the 
first unit to develop language skills and foundation, we will be using the Language Power Level A and B, Building 
Language Proficiency Series for the Beginners bridge class.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

At this moment, The Harold O. Levy School 52 does not offer a Dual Language Program.   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 In our TBE program as well as in our Freestanding ENL program, students receive 10 periods per week (45 minutes each) of 
standalone ENL/ELA. In the TBE program, students are taught math, science, and social studies in their home language 
(Spanish), which shifts to more instruction in English as students gain English proficiency. In the standalone ENL program, 
students are taught in English, but they are provided with appropriate home language supports including translated materials 
to communicate with parents, translated versions of texts covered in our common units (ex. "To Kill a Mockingbird", "Animal 
Farm", and “When I Was Puerto Rican”), access to bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, and ongoing opportunities to engage 
with peers in their home language and in English while completing in-class activities.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In both our TBE and standalone ENL programs, teachers focus on building content knowledge and academic language within 
our common units of study across content areas and grades. All students engage in the same school-developed common units 
(for each grade and subject), and as such, all students must be able to access grade-appropriate complex texts and actively 
participate in daily lessons. Literacy coaches, ENL and bilingual teachers work with ELA and social studies teachers to help 
them scaffold their instruction for ELLs by focusing on building academic vocabulary related to unit concepts, integrating the 
use of new terms into class discussions, and requiring students to use terminology on graphic organizers, and in performance 
tasks. In addition, teachers develop PowerPoint presentations with key content, concepts, text-based quotes and visual 
representations to ensure students are able to collaboratively engage in close reading activities, math talks, science inquiry, 
and learn new academic vocabulary that is applicable across content areas.  ENL, bilingual, science and social studies teachers 
also support ELLs at all proficiency levels by exposing them to a variety of writing experiences. Students are supported through 
the use of graphic organizers, templates, and sentence starters at the beginning level, and move to developing extended 
writing pieces in both content and style as they advance. ELLs are also supported via teacher modeling, shared writing 
experiences, and opportunities to engage in self- and peer-assessment using our school-developed common rubrics. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students in our TBE program take the new Home Language Periodic Assessment at the beginning and at the end of the school 
year, as do students in the standalone ENL program whose home language is Spanish. The results of the ELE assessment help 
our school to identify students who need extra support in Spanish language arts, and to place students in the appropriate level 
of Spanish native language arts instruction. Furthermore, TBE teachers administer assessments in students' native language as 
part of their regular practice. To support students' native language development, the majority of formative assessments in TBE 
classrooms occur in our students' native language (Spanish). TBE teachers of math, science and social studies informally assess 
students' home language growth and needs through classroom discussions and one-on-one conversations, and more formally 
through content-based tests in Spanish. ENL teachers encourage entering and emerging students to engage in discussions in 
both Spanish and English, and complete shared writing in Spanish and English. These assessments can be formally or informally 
completed, such as having students explain an activity or a task in their native language, also through the use of glossaries and 
dictionaries in both languages. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
a. For our SIFE students, we focus on connecting students’ prior knowledge to their current learning.  Also, our teachers plan 
multiple entry points for their lessons, often including video clips and PowerPoint slides to build background and contextualize 
concepts and texts. Teachers choose engaging topics and texts that appeal to a wide range of student interests and needs, and 
make connections between disciplines to enhance understanding and to further promote academic language. In addition, our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

teachers provide a variety of learning experiences to develop students’ critical thinking, collaboration skills, and learner 
autonomy. SIFE students need to feel some amount of control over their learning to feel valued and be motivated. b. For our 
Newcomers, we focus on "survival" skills and on connecting students' learning to the content areas of social studies, math, 
science and language arts. Students' English language development is supported through the purposeful use of scaffolding and 
differentiation strategies as teachers engage Newcomers in our common units of study. In 2018-2019, we will 
continue offering  a foundation class including all three (6th, 7th, and 8th) grades level for newcomer students to help them 
build necessary academic language while also building content knowledge. For the first unit, we will use the Language Power 
Level A and B, Building Language Proficiency series for this foundation class. In addition, Newcomers participate in our 
Saturday Title III program to further build their English language skills. c. For students receiving 4 to 6 years of ENL services, or 
developing ELLs, we know that it is important to analyze their data in order to identify patterns and trends, set SMART goals, 
and identify interim benchmarks of progress, so our teachers meet regularly to discuss student data. Teachers use findings 
from student data to plan opportunities for re-teaching concepts and skills that need further attention, and to revise curricula 
as per student learning needs. We find that developing ELLs often need support with organizing and developing their ideas in 
writing, so we provide graphic organizers and outlines to support them. We also find that some struggle with grammar and 
conventions, so we work with them individually on any issues. We also engage students in self- and peer-reflection in order to 
teach them how to set their own achievement goals and work toward achieving them. These students are also generally 
placed in monolingual classes (as per parent choice) so that they will receive their content in English. Further, these students 
are invited to participate in our tutoring cycles, Saturday Enrichment program, and after school homework helper program. d. 
For our long term ELLs, we mostly follow the same plan as our developing ELLs. We pay attention to data and plan instruction 
accordingly. Where our students are not advancing in reading or writing, we plan instruction to target their needs. To support 
reading needs, we pair long term ELLs with proficient peers to engage in classroom activities. Long term ELLs work alongside 
proficient peers to complete close reading activities, text excerpt analyses, and quote interpretation. To support writing needs, 
teachers confer with students one-one-one multiple times during the writing process to offer formative feedback on language, 
content, and organization needs. We work with students to improve their writing through the multiple draft process. We also 
pair them with proficient peers to provide additional feedback. ENL teachers also support content teachers to help long term 
ELLs reach standards by integrating self-regulation strategies into their instruction. ENL teachers recommend that content 
teachers help long term ELLs build academic language skills by having students keep interactive notebooks, journals, and 
personal vocabulary lists. e. For our former ELLs, the ENL Coordinator in charge of Instruction regularly collaborates with 
teachers of former ELLs during teacher team meetings to offer support. The ENL Coordinator conducts classroom visits on 
teacher request. During classroom visits, the ENL Coordinator examines how the teacher interacts with former ELLs, how ELLs 
interact with classmates and with the content, and thinks about how to scaffold and differentiate instruction for the former 
ELLs. The ENL Coordinator meets with teachers to offer feedback and suggestions for how to support the needs of former ELLs. 
Common suggestions include purposeful student pairings and groupings, use of video clips to build background and provide 
context, student-generated vocabulary dictionaries and regular AIS instruction to provide one-on-one or small group support.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
In working with our ELL-SWDs, instruction is prescribed in a manner that accommodates the student’s exceptionalities. With 
the exception of the inclusion program, ELL-SWDs have access to the same common units of instruction as their general 
education peers. Instruction is provided within a relevant cultural context so that the students can understand expectations. 
Our ENL teachers with ELL-SWDs carefully scaffold instruction and follow IEPs of their students to ensure their learning needs 
are being met. Teachers provide scaffolds such as visuals, modeling, and final products based on the student’s need and 
provide opportunities for the student to succeed in class. Our bilingual special education teachers develop lessons and 
materials appropriate to student needs, modify unit lessons and materials, evaluate student progress, and develop individual 
plans and materials as needed. English language learners whose parents “opt out” of the bilingual program, or students who 
test out of the bilingual program, continue to receive support services, including standalone ENL instruction, from licensed ENL 
teachers daily, depending on their level of English language proficiency.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

Our ELL-SWD have individualized education plans (IEPs) and receive services through the school’s special education program, 
which provides students with the least restrictive environment consistent with their individual needs. An IEP teacher monitors 
the implementation of each student’s plan. Inclusion, mainstreaming, and special education teacher support services (SETSS) 
are instrumental in achieving our goals. The inclusion program places ELL-SWDs in general education classes full time, while 
maintaining a student-teacher ratio of 12:1 (two teachers are assigned to each inclusion class). Students are placed in the 
inclusion program through IEPs, teacher input, and review by special education staff. The inclusion program allows ELL-SWDs 
to receive content instruction from licensed specialists in each subject, and also to interact fully with their peers. As per our 
ELL-SWDs students' needs and IEP recommendations, we offer one ICT (integrated co-teaching) class in each grade, and 
several self-contained classes, mixed grades. In ICT classes, special educators are paired with content teachers to provide 
support as mandated by students' IEPs, and two ENL teachers provide push-in services to self-contained ELL-SWDs. By 
providing students with the instructional program recommended within their IEPs, students are ensured instruction in the 
least restrictive environment that also supports their English language development. ICT classes follow the same common units 
as all general education, ENL and bilingual classes. Self-contained classes, whenever appropriate, use common units as well, 
supplemented with texts and materials that meet ELL-SWD needs. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
To meet the intervention needs of our ELLs, we offer integrated ENL support, tutoring cycles, after-school and enrichment 
programs. As part of the CR Part 154.2 regulations, ENL teachers work with content classes teachers to offer Integrated ENL for 
up to 5 periods per week. Our tutoring cycles are designed for students who are at risk of academic failure, as well as SIFE 
students or those students performing at Level 1 on NYS English or mathematics exams. Teachers use their own class materials 
to provide individualized instruction to the targeted population. The tutoring cycles are also offered to ELLs, where an ENL 
teacher works with students approximately for six weeks to offer targeted academic language instruction and complete any 
missing work. Our after-school program is offered through an extended school-day program designed to service Level 1 
students, both ELLs and SWD-ELLs. The program provides extra support to our students in the areas of reading comprehension, 
vocabulary, grammar, word analysis, and math skills. It also provides our students with test preparation.  All programs are 
provided in English, however, these programs may include instruction in Spanish, as per ELL students' needs and proficiency 
levels.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on previous data and trends, in 2018-2019, we will continue grouping our ELL students performing at a lower level, by 
level to help our ELLs, especially our newcomers, build necessary academic language and content to succeed in the new 
language and in their classes. ELLs at the entering level class will be using the Language Power Level A and B, Building Language 
Proficiency series for the first unit, as they continue to acquire language skills they will use common developed units. As per 
the other groups, over the course, ENL teachers have developed units for ELL students that give them the opportunity to 
participate in the same rigorous and engaging curriculum as their peers but at the same time using their personal experiences 
and background knowledge as guide of developing academic language skills in the new language. The units have been 
designed to be used throughout grades based on the student’s language proficiency level. The ENL teacher will adjust the 
scope and sequence and daily lessons to meet the needs of the students in this class. We are providing these services because 
we want to help all ELLs acquire the language and skills needed to be active participants in their other courses as quickly as 
possible, and integrating them in our regular TBE and Standalone ENL classes has proven not to be enough support for 
students just beginning to learn English. We are also offering integrated ENL services to help our ELLs and FELLs that are in 
monolingual classes build necessary academic language and content to succeed in their other classes, as well. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

This question is not applicable to our school. We will continue to provide programs and services as per ELL population, parent 
choice, and student needs.       
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

Our ELLs and ELL-SWDs are given first priority in our after school and supplemental service programs. They are all invited to 
participate and regularly attend Title III, tutoring cycles, Saturday and after school enrichment program, and homework help 
after school sessions.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Two years ago, The Harold O. Levy School 52, was outfitted with new Apple technology to enhance our capacity to provide 
technology-rich and enriching instruction for all of our students. Each classroom is equipped with an Apple TV for the teacher 
to project lesson content and interact with students. Each student have access to an iPad to engage in lesson activities and 
hone research skills. All teachers use projectors and computers in their classrooms, and some classrooms are equipped with 
laptops for student use. For developing and long term ELLs, we offer grammar instruction student workbooks to supplement 
ELA/ENL instruction, and for our Newcomers, they will use the Language Power, Building Language Proficiency series. In 
addition we have purchased Scholastic Picture Dictionaries with vocabulary building workbooks for our Newcomer ELLs, 
especially our non-Spanish speakers for whom we do not have as many home language support materials.   
 
Last year we also piloted a program called iLit ELLs which is research-based, digital intervention used to enhanced with explicit, 
point-of-use scaffolding, ELL strategies and content to support English language development so English learners, including 
long-term English learners, can build academic language through word study, develop prosody with the English language, 
engage in academic discourse by improving English language production, and become independent readers who reach 
classification and are successful working at grade level. ENL teachers integrated this foundation program along with their 
curriculum to accommodate and facilitate language acquisition for all learners. All TBE classes across grades had the 
opportunity to engaged through their iPads and use this program as support for their ELL students. 
This year we also piloted an assessment program called Assessment Matters which is use to identify and implement common 
assessments and refine instruction based on analysis of data. This program was used and will keep being used to track 
students progress throughout the school year in all content areas.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the TBE program, students are taught math, science and social studies in their home language, while they are taught 
standalone ENL in English with home language support, including bilingual dictionaries, texts translated into Spanish, and peer 
translation as needed. In the ENL program, students are taught in all content areas in English, with home language support 
including access to bilingual dictionaries, translated materials, and peer translation when needed. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All ELLs are programmed appropriately according to their age and previous school records indicating the correct grade level for 
them to be placed in. Since ELLs are carefully programmed to be at the correct grade level, and in a class aligned with parent 
program selection, we rarely encounter incorrect services and placements. In the rare event that this occurs, teachers and 
parents meet with intake personnel to reprogram the student appropriately, and when needed, offer alternatives to meet the 
child's needs. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
To ensure that all school resources are available to all of our students, we meet up with the other two schools in the building 
to schedule specific times for the use of the following facilities: gym, cafeteria, library, and auditorium. All times are arranged 
prior to the event to ensure that all the students’ needs at The Harold O. Levy School 52 are met.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Prior to the beginning of the school year, newly arrived ELLs get to participate in our Inwood Community Service program, 
where they become familiar with the school, the community itself, and future classmates. As for ELLs that arrive during 
throughout school year,  the registration team which includes the parent coordinator, welcomes the students and their 
families to School 52. The student is given a brief tour of the school. A class schedule is given to the student and the child is 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

shown how to read it, as well as the material list needed for all classes. The student is introduced to the Floor Advisor/Dean. If 
the student is in eighth grade, the student is introduced to the eighth grade counselor to discuss high school options. They are 
also given information about additional programs which are in our school such as after-school programs, Title III, enrichment 
programs, and tutoring cycles for at risk students. The after-school program gives the newly arrived ELLs the opportunity to 
acclimate to the new school and become familiar with their classmates.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

All students in the eighth grade, including ELLs, are offered either Spanish and French as an elective, depending on the class.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

This question is not applicable because at this time we do not offer a Dual Language program. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In order to better meet the needs of our English Language Learners, The Harold O. Levy School 52 offers different PDs to 
support ENL and content-level teachers in exploring student data and implications for instruction, new pedagogical methods 
such as Collaborative Strategic Reading, and differentiating learning targets and tasks to meet the needs of ELLs. These 
objectives will be achieved by organizing opportunities for staff to observe and reflect on each other’s practices, developing 
and facilitating professional development meetings, assessing teacher needs, modeling lessons and engaging in teacher 
interclass visitations, and turn-keying professional development workshops that the ENL/Bilingual teachers offer to other 
content area teachers.  In addition, ENL teachers will assist content teachers in creating scaffolds for ELLs of various proficiency 
levels using our common curriculum and in researching and acquiring additional instructional materials that will meet the 
needs of our ELL students.   In our continued efforts to better support our ELLs, we acknowledge the significance of creating a 
collaborative environment where teachers feel comfortable sharing questions, concerns and ideas, and discussing the 
structure and content of their lessons and instruction. To that end, all teachers are programmed to attend four PLCs 
(Professional Learning community weekly, three that are content-based and one that is interdisciplinary by grade. These 
meetings require teachers to work together to solve classroom issues, plan lessons from common units of study, engage in 
inquiry, or share a presentation on a specific topic with colleagues. These on-going meetings were designed to enhance 
collaboration amongst staff, aid teachers in scaffolding their lessons to reach all students, and to help teachers develop 
confidence, familiarity, and independence within their subject area and grade.  These meetings have been instrumental in 
discussing and planning for our ELLs, and serve as the space where ENL teachers and teacher leaders turn-key professional 
development received from outside of our school setting.  
 
Teachers of ELLs regularly attend staff-facilitated professional development, and the ENL teachers attend NYC Department of 
Education and School Support Network-offered professional development and turn-keys it to teachers during Monday after 
school PD sessions. Teacher-facilitated staff development for teachers of ELls (and all teachers) has included using assessment 
data to inform instruction, implementing Socratic Seminar to support students' critical thinking and close reading of texts, 
effective strategies to teach vocabulary, and effective strategies to teach writing with a focus on organization and transitions. 
We are in the process of turn-keying professional development on implementing Collaborative Strategic Reading (CSR) across 
content areas, which supports students with developing close reading skills through ongoing collaboration with peers. This 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

year, our ENL teachers attended a four day QTEL training, Quality Teaching for English Learners, that supports ELLs and 
teachers with a unique approach to engage and accelerate students’ academic literacy and content knowledge.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
This year all teachers participated in professional development to unpack ELL data including NYSESLAT scores and NYS ELA 
scores to determine patterns and trends, and implications for instruction. These sessions were facilitated by the ENL 
Coordinator. In addition, ENL and bilingual teachers attended multiple PD sessions offered by our School Support Network 
specific to English language learners called ELL Specialist Meetings. Topics of the ELL Specialist Meetings included ELL 
Compliance-related concerns (ATS data, ELL identification and Parent Notification, ELL Compliance Cases and Problem Solving, 
QTEL (Quality Teaching for English Learners), and NYSESLAT Turnkey training. Other PD offerings attended include Planning for 
an Implementing Transitional Bilingual Programs, Collaborative Strategic Reading, and Leading Advanced Literacy Instruction to 
Foster ELLs Achievement in Middle Schools (multiple sessions). Agendas for PDs offered and attended are kept in a binder, as 
are staff attendance records.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The Harold O. Levy School 52 recognizes the crucial role of parental involvement in students’ academic performance. In order 
to build a strong and productive partnership between school and home, a full-time Parent Coordinator facilitates two-way 
communication with parents and coordinates activities among the staff, School Leadership Team, and Parents’ Association. 
The Parent Coordinator is also involved in the initial orientation sessions, as well as focus groups and training workshops for 
parents. Our Parent Coordinator speaks Spanish, as do most our parents, and is available during school hours. We also invite 
the parents of our ELLs to our monthly parent meetings. These are held during a morning session over breakfast in the school, 
and also within the evening, in order to accommodate our parents’ various schedules. At School 52, we also provide parent 
engagement meetings for parents every Tuesday by grade on a variety of topics that may be of interest for parents such as 
social media responsibility, adolescent development, High School readiness, promotional and graduation requirements, 
amongst other topics. 
Throughout the school year, the ENL Department will be invited to attend meetings to explain the NYSESLAT exam and will 
provide ways to help parents help their children at home. The guidance department with the assistant principal in charge of 
the ELLs, will conduct workshops to inform parents about promotional and graduation requirements, and to help parents 
enable their children to meet these requirements.  The special education department will conduct parent workshops to explain 
the IEP, and “town meetings” to discuss ways in which parents can help their children succeed academically, improve their 
attendance, and maintain a healthy parent-child relationships. 
Our parents’ needs are heard and addressed through the monthly meetings with our Parent Coordinator. In addition, we also 
analyze the data from the annual Learning Environment Survey that we ask parents to complete. This gives us information on 
parents’ opinion of our academic and social programs, the progress of our school, and expertise of our teachers. Also, parents 
may take an active role in our school by volunteering within the school. Further, our school holds workshops for parents on 
how to support their children to succeed academically at home, and how to support their children with the Common Core 
Standards. 
In these schools activities where parents are involved, they are accommodated with their preferred oral and written 
communication either through letters sent home, the automated voice caller and in-school interpretation and translation as 
needed. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
At The Harold O. Levy School 52, the parent coordinator, guidance counselor and principal hold monthly parent workshops to 
address parents' questions and needs, and promote their involvement in school activities. Periodically, ELL parents meet with 
the parent coordinator to plan workshops and extracurricular activities such as Field Day, Senior BBQ and breakfast, Talent

Show, amongst other activities and workshops. School 52 offers Zumba and evening English classes for parents, and also the 
principal periodically meet the parents of ELL to read (in Spanish) the book their child is reading in class, therefore parents can 
support their child at home.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lupe León, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

According to our 2018-2019 school demographics 94% of our students are Latino. Administrators, teachers and 
staff reported that many of our parents are Spanish monolinguals. At various meetings and workshops, parents 
have indicated their preference for materials to be in Spanish. Also, according to our Parent/Guardian Home 
Language Identification Survey, the majority of our students speak Spanish most of the time with their parents. 
According to the ATS Home Language Report- RHLA, our students’ home language is the following: English 17.7%, 
Arabic 0.3%, American Sign 0.3% and Spanish 81.5%. Our parents’ selection of preferred language of 
communication is: 19.7% English, 0.03% Arabic, and 80% Spanish. For those few parents who speak Mandinka and 
Arabic, we use a translator. As a result of these surveys, we have identified the need to ensure that 
communication is provided to our parents in both English and in Spanish. All parental communication (written and 
oral, as well as School Messenger) is sent home in both English and in Spanish. All Parent Association meetings are 
held in English with Spanish translation. All Parent-Teacher Conferences are held in English with Spanish 
translation available in each classroom for monolingual teachers. Any teacher-parent meetings or administrator-
parent meetings has Spanish translation available. Main office personnel are bilingual. Our Parent Coordinator is

bilingual. Staff in both the health and dental clinic are bilingual. General school-based information is typically laid 
out before the school-year begins in an agreed upon school calendar of events and important information. 
Therefore, all other required DOE information to parents is provided in both English and Spanish.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In our parent student handbook, we have listed the parents' bill of rights. As the visitors sign into the building there is 
a Language ID Guide on the wall. The majority of posted items are in English and Spanish, especially those concerning 
upcoming events or opportunities to support students and their families for items such as, academics, nutrition, and 
extra-curricular. The parent coordinator also provides oral translation services for all information given. In every 
parent activity there will be oral and written interpretation services provided.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will have a small survey during one of the monthly meetings asking parents if they are satisfied with the quality 
and availability of translation services. Survey is provided in English and Spanish, however if another language is 
needed we will request translation services through the city. An oral survey may be conducted using Language Line for 
languages that may not have a written format or as cost saving measures. Also, for these surveys we will use 
translated parent surveys available on the Translation and Interpretation Unit's Intranet page and/or an oral survey 
may be conducted using Language Line for languages that may not have a written format or as cost saving measures.
