Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

OUR MISSION STATEMENT 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

QHSLS seeks to graduate students prepared for success in college and career. With the support of caring educators 
who foster our core values of PRIDE (partnership, responsibility, inquiry, determination, and empathy), our students 
engage in a comprehensive curriculum that includes the intensive study of English and Mandarin Chinese. By meeting

the linguistic, academic, and socio-emotional needs of all our students, we challenge and encourage our graduates to 
achieve their best potential, not just in one language but in two. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

BACKGROUND 

The Queens High School for Language Studies (QHSLS) opened in September 2013 on the Flushing Educational 
Campus, a historic building shared with Veritas Academy and Flushing High School. In the 2018-2019 school year, our 
school serves over 420 students in grades 9 to 12. QHSLS offers a transitional bilingual education program in 
Mandarin Chinese and seeks to serve a community of students that is 50% English proficient and 50% English 
Language Learner. Our ELLs are all Chinese speaking, and the vast majority have been in the United States less than 
three years. Our English proficient students are diverse in their backgrounds, and many are former ELLs. Close to 
twenty languages are spoken by our school community. As a small high school, thirty-two teaching faculty, ten 
support faculty, and three administrators comprise our faculty. Our school qualifies for Title I School Wide 
Programming.  

In June 2017, we celebrated our first graduation. 95% of our first cohort graduated with over half achieving an 
Advanced Regents diploma. In June 2018, 97% of our second cohort graduated with over half again achieving an 
Advanced Regents diploma. 93% of our first cohort of graduates have enrolled in post-secondary schools; 80% of 
these schools are 4-year colleges. Because many of our students are first in their family to attend college in the United 
States, we have created an early college and career awareness program that includes workshops facilitated by our 
upperclassmen for 9th and 10th graders, a college access class in 11th grade, and robust one-to-one counseling in the 
12th grade with our college counselor and the support of trained senior peer counselors, called Youth Leaders. 

Community based organizations we partner with include Chinese Planning Council (CPC) and Asian Americans for 
Equality (AAFE). Our work with CPC ensures we have an after school program, Monday through Thursday, until 5PM 
for our students. This includes peer tutoring, a supervised homework space, and extra-curricular activities including 
trips around the city and state. Our partnership with AAFE supports our families with social services, pathways to 
citizenship, financial planning, and leadership programs for students.  

This year, QHSLS is proud to be a Learning Partners host school for a second year. This is our fifth year in the program. 
We are also part of the CUNY Affinity Network, AP for ALL, Algebra for ALL, and College Access for ALL initiatives. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school is designed to serve New York City’s adolescent Chinese immigrant learners, providing intensive ENL 
instruction and a transitional bilingual education program. This supports their continued learning in the content areas 
as our students learn academic English. Currently, our school is approximately 30% ELL or recent FELL, with 15% at the 
transitioning level or below and 15% at the expanding or commanding level.  

Another special student population are our students with disabilities, who we currently serve through ICT settings and 
SETTS classes. Approximately 6% of our students have an IEP. Three of our students with disabilities are also ELLs.

OUR PROGRESS: 

Over the past year, areas of progress within the Framework for Great Schools include Rigorous Instruction, Supportive 
Environment, and Collaborative Teachers. 

For Rigorous Instruction, our goal last year was to improve our students' achievement through inquiry cycles that 
supported teachers in adjusting curriculum and instruction, as measured by a 3% increase in the number of students 
demonstrating 4-year college readiness from 73% to 76%. Last year, our 4-year college readiness index was at 80%. In 
2017-18, we worked with our subject area departments to strengthen inquiry cycles, meeting two to three times a 
month with teacher-leaders to support and monitor this work. Together with instructional rounds completed within 
our Learning Partners programming, we strived to improve the pedagogy in our school, particularly with regard to 
differentiation of instruction to increase student independence. 

For Supportive Environment, our goal was to increase the engagement of our at-risk students through targeted socio-
emotional supports, as evidenced by a decrease in high-level infractions in OORS from 20%, from 20 incidents to 16. 
Last year, we had a total of seven incidents, with four at Level 4 and none at Level 5. The prior year, we had nine 
incidents at Level 4 and one incident at a Level 5. A key component of this work was building the capacity of our entire 
staff to review student data, both quantitative and qualitative, academic and behavioral, to target students who were 
most at-risk.  

For Collaborative Teachers, our goal last year was to improve the coherence of our curriculum by collaborating in 
departments to vertically align unit plans and curriculum maps to the Common Core Learning Standards. In 2016-17, 
our teachers answered positively to School Survey questions around the CC shifts in literacy and math at 79% and 
84%, below the city average. In 2017-18, positive responses improved to 94% and 88%, meeting the city average. Our 
improvement here is a result of all our departments' work to align and examine common assessments, across the 
grade levels, to the CCLS in literacy. 

Our areas of focus continue to be in Effective School Leadership to improve instruction across our school and Strong 
Family-Community Ties to improve parent involvement. 

For Effective School Leadership, our goal last year was to improve instruction with an emphasis on using formative 
assessment to improve differentiation, demonstrated by a 0.1 increase in MOTP average scores in Domain 3, from 2.7 
to 2.8. By June, our MOTP average score for Domain 3 remained the same at 2.7. We aimed to vary supports provided 
to teachers and will continue working on this goal in 2018-19. Additionally, much of the 2017-18 school year was 
spent calibrating our observations among the two assistant principals and principal. With the addition of a second AP 
last year, we prioritized norming our evaluations and assuring teachers were receiving consistent and fair feedback 
and scoring. As a result, we are better equipped this year to provide differentiated supports for teachers to improve 
their teaching practice and will continue striving towards this goal. Our work to norm and align feedback resulted in 
positive teacher survey responses related to Trust, detailed more below. 

For Strong Family-Community Ties, our goal last year was to more effectively communicate and collaborate with our 
parents around expectations for student independence and ownership of their learning, as evidenced by a 10% 
increase in positive responses to feedback surveys after parent workshops and conferences. We achieved this goal 
based on feedback from our student-led parent-teacher conferences; however, positive responses to the DOE school 
survey were approximately the same as in prior years, showing almost no change.  

Our school's progress is also revealed in the Trust and Student Achievement portions of the Framework for Great 
schools. The 2017-18 school survey results reveal that teacher-principal trust continues to be strong, with 98% of 
responses being positive, 16% above the city average. 100% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that the principal 
and assistant principal function as a cohesive unit, 20% above the city average. With the addition of a second assistant 
principal, this was an important question for our administrative team. All other relationships remained strong, above

or well above the city average, including teacher to teacher, student to teacher, and parents to teachers and principal. 
As we continue to strive in our areas of focus, the component of trust is the foundation for our improvement efforts. 

Our student achievement metrics continue to reflect the work of our school: 97% of our second cohort graduated last 
year with 58% achieving an Advanced Regents diploma. We've maintained credit accumulation for students in Years 1 
(98%), 2 (97%), and 3 (93%). We also have our first data around post-secondary enrollment. 93% of our first cohort of 
graduates have enrolled in post-secondary institutions. Another important metric that we monitor closely is our 
attendance. We maintained a 95% attendance rate with 82% of our students with greater than 90% annual 
attendance. We will continue to monitor and strive to improve our students' achievement and preparation towards 
college and career.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. Strengths:  

Through the monitoring of student data, individualized student programming, and targeted counseling, we work to 
ensure the vast majority of our students are on track in their progress towards graduation. Our overall Regents 
Completion Rate and College Readiness Index continues to be well above our peer group average. 

2017-18 Student Achievement Metrics  

  Graduation: 97%. Advanced Regents Diploma Achievement: 58%.  
  College Readiness Index 80% (2017-18); 73% (2016-17); College Readiness Lowest 3rd (69%) 
  Average Regents Completion 84% (2017-18); 89% (2016-17)  

2. Priority Needs: 

Improving the teaching and learning that occurs across our classrooms is a continual area of improvement. Our focus 
this year is the cognitive engagement of our students, using research from Robert Marzano et. al. and the work of 
Zaretta Hammond around Culturally Responsive Teaching. Both researchers discuss the importance in accessing the 
long-term memory in learning through the cultivation of positive classroom environments, teacher-student 
relationships, and student-centered pedagogy and curricula. As a result of this work, we hope to see the achievement 
of our students across subject classes increase.  

2017-18 Average Regents Score: 

  English: 70.8 
  Algebra 1: 74.3; Algebra 2: 69; Geometry (not administered in 2017-2018) 
 
  Global History: 77.3; US History: 79.0 

Living Environment: 76.5; Earth Science: 77; Chemistry 70; Physics: 58

2017-18 School Survey 

The Rigorous Instruction score moved from 2.61 to 2.85. Improvement in this score is due to teacher and student 
survey responses (from 2.94 to 3.88). The overall framework score also reflects our Quality Review from 2016-17. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers will facilitate more engaging and academically rigorous learning experiences for all students, 
as measured by an increase of 3% in our average Regents scores for all administered exams.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. Strengths:  

We have strong systems and structures in place to monitor student attendance and to communicate concerns around 
our students' socio-emotional needs between teachers and guidance/administration. Communication with parents is 
also key and aided with the use of Remind. Additional monitoring is supported by school wide technology use of 
Google Apps for Education and IO Education. 

We have also worked hard to build a school culture that nurtures a growth mindset among our community, 
attributing success to effort and behaviors, not innate ability or intelligence. For example, we have a common list of 
behaviors aligned to our core values of PRIDE, with which students can self-assess around throughout their time at 
QHSLS. An example of a structure that supports this is our customization of progress report card comments to 
describe these behaviors in greater detail, providing feedback to our students as well. 

Attendance Data 

2017-18 Attendance: 95% (95% in 2016-17) 

2017-18 School Survey 

  Our framework score is 4.26, placing us above the city average by 0.87. (4.09 in 2016-17) 
  85% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the adults at their school recognize disruptive behavior as 

social-emotional learning opportunities. (80% in 2016-17) 

  79% of students responded that in most or all of their classes, their teachers help them catch up if they are 

behind. (78% in 2016-17) 

2016-17 Quality Review  

  Positive Learning Environment (1.4): Well Developed 
  Culture for Learning (3.4): Proficient 

2. Priority Needs:  

We aim to continue building the capacity of our teachers to recognize and respond to our students' socio-emotional 
learning needs through increased teacher to teacher communication and collaboration. We also recognize the need 
for teachers to communicate more regularly with the students they have for student-led parent-teacher conferences. 
At QHSLS, in lieu of traditional parent-teacher conferences, our teachers schedule conferences with the families of 13-

15 students. These teachers have the students in their content classes while also serving as their designated SLC 
teacher. 

2017-18 School Survey 

  67% of students responded that, in most or all of their classes, their teachers support them when they are 

upset. (66% in 2016-17) 

  71% of students responded that, in most or all of their classes, their teachers notice if they have trouble 

learning something. (70% in 2016-17) 

Attendance 

82% of students have attendance greater than 90%. (falling from 86% in 2016-17) 

2017-18 Student Perception Survey 

  Our average for favorable responses for the Teacher-Student Relationships portion was 65% (64% in 2016-17; 

city average: 63%). 

  Our average for favorable responses for the Classroom Climate portion was 76% (73% in 2016-17; city 

average: 67%). 

  59% of students answered favorably to the question (extremely concerned or very concerned): "If you walked 

into class upset, how concerned would your teacher be?" (64% in 2016-17) 

  47% of students answered favorably to the question (extremely connected or very connected): "How 

connected do you feel to the teacher in this class?" (48% in 2016-17) 

3. Policies, Practices, and Structures 

Our teachers have agreed to a School Based Option to meet as a faculty after school on Fridays 14 times throughout 
the year. This provides time for teachers to meet within grade level teams to discuss student concerns. With both 
qualitative and quantitative data provided by administration, and the shared observations of colleagues, teachers 
then develop a clearer understanding of the whole student. This year, our faculty has also passed a SBO to create 
additional time to meet four times throughout the year, first with their SLC students for a double block to reflect on 
progress and goal-set, and then after as a faculty to debrief and plan next steps.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, students will feel more connected to the school community as a result of receiving more personalized 
supports, as measured by a 3% increase in the percentage of students who have above a 90% attendance for the 
year, from 82% to 85%.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Team of interested teachers will collaborate with school 
leadership on expansion of existing SLC structure. This includes 
lesson planning for four double blocks with SLC students 
throughout the year. 

Teachers will collaborate in grade teams to examine student data 
to better support their SLC students. Administration will support 
conversations by providing important quantitative and 
qualitative data. 

Teachers will conference and make outreach to students and 
families who are at greater-risk, as evidenced by attendance 
data, grade data, and qualitative anecdotes. 

Teachers will meet with their SLC students four times throughout 
the year. These meetings will give students time, under the 
guidance of their teachers, to set goals and reflect on their 
behaviors, as well as time for teachers to conference with 
students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Strengths: 

Our teachers meet in departments every other day during a common plan time period that is programmed into their 
schedules. This ensures there is protected time for teachers to collaborate around shared goals, provide feedback to 
one another, conduct cycles of inquiry, and vertically align curricula. Administration meets with department lead-
teachers two to three times a month to support and monitor progress. Teachers' work in departments is central to 
our school's professional development and to our commitment to continuous improvement. 

2017-18 School Survey 

Framework element score increased from 4.15 to 4.32 for Collaborative Teachers. 

 
  93% of teachers say that at their school teachers make a conscious effort to coordinate their teaching with 

instruction at other grade levels. (85% in 2016-17) 

  97% of teachers say that they had opportunities to work productively with colleagues at their school on 

professional development. (96% in 2016-17) 

  100% of teachers say they trust each other. (96% in 2016-17) 

2016-17 Quality Review  

  Teacher Teams (4.2): Proficient 
 

Leveraging Resources (1.3): Well Developed 

2. Priority Needs: 

Now in our sixth year as a school, with two graduating classes, our work to vertically align our curricula has been our 
focus. Our teachers continue to collaborate to provide an increasingly more complex and rigorous learning experience 
as students progress through the grades. In particular, we recognize an area for improvement continues to be our 
students' performance on Advanced Regents exams, the SATs, and AP Exams.  

2017-18 Achievement Metrics 

  College and Career Prep Course Index (CCPCI) 81%; Lowest 3rd: 46% 
  4-Year College Readiness Rate 80% (67% in 2016-17); Lowest 3rd: 69%

Teachers will conduct intervisitations within departments to 
improve vertical alignment across grades, to better understand 
classroom contexts, and to provide feedback around student-
centered practices. 

Within departments, teachers will conduct assessment and 
inquiry cycles to improve curriculum and teaching. Following 
each cycle, departments will examine data and student work to 
inform next steps.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Strengths: 

Our greatest strength relative to this Framework element is the trust administration cultivates with teachers. We have 
a transparent and organized structure for teacher observations, evaluation, and coaching. Each year, this begins with 
3-4 days of faculty conferences and professional development the last week of August. Then, throughout the year, 
both the principal and assistant principals prioritize time meeting with faculty to nurture professional growth. As our 
school has developed, we have also distributed leadership to teacher-leaders who have the expertise and the 
coaching capacity to support their peers. In 2017-18, this includes a model teacher who supports our teachers in 
instruction for ELLs and a peer-collaborative teacher who supports our ICT collaborations and all teachers in thinking 
through differentiation for our students with disabilities. This year, we also plan to leverage the content-specific 
supports offered by our CUNY School Support network. 

2017-18 School Survey 

  100% of teachers agreed that the principal makes clear to the staff his or her expectations for meeting 

instructional goals. (100% in 2016-17) 

  97% of teachers agreed or strongly agree that the principal sets clear expectations for teachers about 

implementing what they have learned in professional development. (89% in 2016-17) 

  100% of teachers say that the principal knows what's going on in their classroom. (93% in 2016-17) 
  90% of teachers say that at our school, once we start a new program, we follow up to make sure it's working. 

(89% in 2016-17) 

  97% of teachers say that their professional development experiences have been sustained and coherent. 

(96% in 2016-17) 

2016-17 Quality Review: 

  Teacher Support and Supervision 4.1: Well Developed/Area of Celebration 
  Goals and Action Plans 3.1: Well Developed 
  Monitoring and Revising Systems 5.1: Proficient 

2017-18 Student Perception Survey 

  76% of students responded positively to questions around Pedagogical Effectiveness across our school. (City 

average: 72%; 74% in 2016-17). 

  76% of students responded positively to questions around Rigorous Expectations across our school. (City 

average: 72%; 75% in 2016-17).

2. Priority Needs 

With regard to Effective School Leadership, our administrative team aims to better differentiate and vary the supports 
we offer teachers. Last year, with the addition of a new assistant principal, we prioritized norming coaching and 
evaluation to ensure a consistent and fair system for all teachers; unfortunately, this meant less time planning and 
implementing differentiated supports.  

MOTP Scores  

  Average across domains: 3.0 
  Average for 1e Planning: 2.92 
  Average for Domain 2: 3.45 
  Average for Domain 3: 2.70 
  Average for 4e Reflection: 3.08 

2017-18 PPO Feedback from Superintendent Fred Walsh 

"Continue to innovate approaches for professional development. For select teachers, implement live coaching and 
video recorded lessons ti improve teacher practice, thereby increasing student engagement...Continue to coach ICT 
partners to be more intentional with their choice of models to ensure all students' needs are met." 

2017-18 Student Perception Survey 

48% of students responded positively to questions around Classroom Engagement across our school. (City average: 
49%; 46% in 2016-17). 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leadership will improve teacher practice by providing an impactful and differentiated 
professional learning plan for teachers as measured by an increase in teacher’s Advance overall ratings, as evidenced 
by a 0.1 average increase in teacher MOTP summary scores, from 3.0 to 3.1.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

Our guidance and administrative support faculty work closely with our teaching faculty to communicate concerns 
raised by our students and families. To serve our large immigrant community in their home language, we have a 
multilingual faculty, including our school's first PTA co-presidents who both now work for our school as a school 
business manager and lead school aide. Additionally, we have implemented systems to better partner with our 
parents. The use of Pupilpath (IO Education) has been in place since 2013, and more recently, our faculty has broadly 
used Remind to securely text message parents. Additionally, our parent coordinator has built partnerships with local 
organizations to provide workshops to our families as well as targeted supports around financial, mental health, and 
citizenship concerns. 

2017-18 School Survey 

  94% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that school staff regularly communicate with them about 

how they can help their child learn. (93% in 2016-17) 

  92% of parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that teachers work closely with them to meet their 

child's needs. (93% in 2016-17) 

  84% of families say that they get opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or 

participating in an activity with their child. 

  96% of families say that our school communicates with them in a language and in a way that they can 

understand. 

Priority Needs: 

Our monthly PTA parent workshops have experienced low attendance over the past two years. Additionally, the 
majority of our parent-leaders in the PTA and SLT are the parents of our juniors and seniors. It is vital that we begin to 
recruit parents in the 9th and 10th grade who will help lead partnerships and improvement work for our school.  

2017-18 Parent Participation  

Student-Led Parent-Teacher Conference parent/guardian participation rate was 85% (80% in 2016-17)

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, school staff will deepen our home-school partnerships and empower parents and guardians as 
effective advocates for their children, as evidenced by a 36% increase in participation at PTA meetings, from an 
average of 22 parents to 30 parents, and an increase of 5% in participation in student-led parent-teacher conferences, 
from 85% parent attendance to 90%.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not

available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement.

creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by 
actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

The Queens HS for Language Studies will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Begin description here:            
In 2018-19, our direct instruction program will target our 11th and 12th grade students who are 
in need of Regents prep support. Our students will be taking the CC ELA Regents exams in 
January, either for the first time (juniors) or again (seniors who earned less than a 75 on their 
previous administration). Students will be targeted again for the June administration, either to 
earn a passing score or to achieve the College Readiness score of 75. Additionally, students who 
need support passing Regents exams, particularly those that are translated (ex. Algebra 2), will 
likewise receive support. The teachers will organize instruction based on the needs of the 
students: this includes flexible groupings based on data from prior assessments, including 
performance on last year's exams and ongoing benchmark assessments) as well as parallel 
teaching to target specific reading and writing skills. The ratio is expected to be 15 to 1. 
Currently, we have the following subgroups for our 11th and 12th graders. This is based on 
2016-17 data. We are awaiting 2017-2018 data. 
- 12th grade: 13 expanding and 2 transitioning, 8 commanding (who scored above a 65 but below 
a 75)- 11th grade: 7 expanding, 8 transitioning, 1 commanding 
The schedule will be a combination of after-school (once a week for 2 hours; Tuesdays 2:45-
4:45) and Saturday classes (3 hours, 9AM to 12PM, running from December to January 
exclusive of holidays. As needed, this will again begin from May to June for 6 sessions). Total 
number of sessions will be at a minimum 12. The language of instruction will be in English, but 
bilingual supports like glossaries and translators will be recommended. Two of our certified ENL 
teachers will be providing this direct instruction. Materials will be made in-house by our 
teachers, adapting from EngageNY curricula and NYS Regents exemplars. Additional resources 
may include Kaplan and other test prep publishers. This will be supplemental to the daily 
instruction. 
Notification of the program will be provided in English and Chinese, both in letters home as well 
as via email and phone for targeted students. Records of both communication and attendance will 
be maintained by the teachers and then submitted to administration.

Part C: Professional Development  
Wednesdays, beginning in November and running until June, to review materials and curricula 
(indicated in Part B) for the program. PD support may be provided by our Affinity Field Support 
as well as the Office of ELLs. Our teachers will be reviewing student data, both classroom data 
and using DOE data analysis tools, during this PD in order to determine strategic grouping and 
then to provide improved guided instruction. Our ELLs will benefit by receiving instruction that 
is targeted towards specific gaps in reading and writing. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

Begin description here:            
QHSLS has a multilingual support staff that speaks multiple dialects of Chinese. Our guidance 
counselors Shun Tu, Jeffrey Ku, and Ms. Leon Chu are bilingual in Mandarin, Cantonese, and 
Spanish. Prior to the start of the school year in 2018-19, we offer a parent orientation in Chinese, 
Spanish, and English. We introduce the staff, review the parent and student handbook, and 
welcome all families into our community. For this orientation and all other parent engagement 
events, invitations are mailed or backpacked home in both English and Chinese, emailed, and 
posted on our school website (also bilingual). Attendance sheets, invitations, and agendas are 
maintained by our parent coordinator and kept in the main office. 
Our parent Coordinator Stephanie Huang and Asian Americans for Equality (AAFE) are working 
together to coordinate parent workshops and events through the Parent Teacher Association. 90-
minute workshops are offered once a month, on a weekday evening or on Saturday morning, and 
focus so far on the following:  
- introducing resources within our school and the local community; this includes English literacy 
classes offered by our CBO partner AAFE 
- introducing strategies to help parents communicate with their teenage students; this includes 
building technology and social media literacy  
- preparing for the college application and financial aid process (this includes college visits for 
parents) 
- understanding what it means to be a college-ready, independent learner 
- understanding graduation requirements and changes to the Common Core and college entrance 
examinations  
- introducing our online grading platform Pupilpath.com; assisting parents with creating email 
and using this website 
We seek feedback after each meeting and modify our schedule according to the input we receive 
from parents. Every month, we also write a newsletter, discussing school highlights, celebrating 
students of the month, and updating parents on upcoming dates and events. These newsletters are 
translated into Chinese and Spanish each time. Finally, throughout the year, we invite parents to 
our school-wide events: a multi-cultural Thanksgiving potluck, Lunar New Year celebration, 
talent showcases, and an Awards night. We seek to include as many parents in these events as 
possible.

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In addition to the NYSITELL and the previous year's NYSESLAT levels, all incoming students take teacher-created diagnostic 
assessments to measure their reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. We also use the STAR program from Renaissance 
Learning to determine reading levels (lexile). This data affects how we program our ENL classes, hiring, and guides curriculum. 
This data is also shared with the entire faculty and particularly reviewed with teachers of our former ELLs who are transitioning 
to ELA classes. 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Common planning time is provided to the ENL department. Regular meetings with administration and the ELL in-take team, 
which also includes our guidance team, a special education teacher as needed, and our parent coordinator, support this effort. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We review their NYSESLAT data and Regents assessment data. We also review in class summative assessment data and 
progress using STAR reading, as well as students' credit accumulation and attendance data. Essentially, we evaluate their 
progress towards college readiness, progress towards graduation, and determine next steps. This includes individually 
programming all students at our school, modifying curriculum, and providing additional interventions outside of the school day 
if needed. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Regular meetings, particularly after each marking period, with the aforementioned team support the review of this data. 
Inquiry work is also built into department teaming that occurs during common planning time. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
One important pattern we notice is that for our students who made the fewest gains, particularly those who are 
Entering/Emerging, attendance and excessive tardiness were major issues for them in the previous year. We are actively 
working to support students who have issues attending school; likewise, we continue to reach out to these parents, providing 
community based resources that may be of additional assistance beyond what we as a school already provide. We are proud 
to report that our ELLs' performance on Regents exams meets or exceeds the performance of our English proficient students. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Data is reviewed with our entire faculty during whole-staff PDs that have been SBOed into our calendar. Any adjustments to 
programming are discussed with teachers as part of our review process. With the parent community, large school program 
changes are communicated to our SLT and PTA board first and then during PTA monthly meetings. Individual programming 
changes are discussed with the families as needed. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

For students who have transitioned out of our TBE program and are taking freestanding ENL classes in 11th or 12th 
grade, students are generally grouped for these classes by level first, then by grade bands (9-10, 10-11, 11-12). 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Students are in a double period block for the Stand-Alone and the Integrated ENL Class. Students are grouped 
according to proficiency levels. In grades 9 and 10 ELL students are grouped in mixed proficiency levels for bilingual 
programming in Social Studies, science, and math. Proficiency levels are also mixed for HLA classes.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All levels of ELLs are provided with 1-3 periods of ENL daily depending on their level and mandated number of minutes. 9th 
and 10th grade students in our TBE program receive social studies, math, and science with bilingual supports. 9th, 10th, and 
11th grade students also have Home Language Arts for one period a day.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Core content is delivered with bilingual and ENL supports. Our social studies teacher in grades 9 and 10 is bilingual certified. 
Our math and science teachers are bilingual and often deliver instruction in Mandarin Chinese and/or provide Chinese 
translation of documents, key vocabulary, instructions, etc. Across our 9  th   and 10  th   grade classrooms, core content 
teachers of science, math, and social studies provide Chinese translation on assessments. All teachers have received 
professional development around supporting ELLs and former ELLs, utilizing the SIOP model. 
 
Our Chinese Native Language Arts teachers also work closely with our ENL team to co-design units along the same set of 
writing and reading skills. This provides additional support for high school level CCLS aligned content. In our school, all teachers 
are expected to scaffold for language development: to explicitly teach Tier 2 and Tier 3 vocabulary, focus on ensuring 
comprehensible input, and intentionally plan for cooperative learning across all core content areas. In meeting the demands of 
the CCLS, teachers use multiple strategies. This includes scaffolding complex texts in teacher-made handouts, explicit framing 
of texts, and incorporating sentence stems into lessons to allow students to better justify their thinking. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

All teachers provide home language supports: this includes written translation of questions on quizzes and exams, translations 
for key vocabulary, allowing students to use dictionaries or translators, and providing time for students to translate for one 
another before completing an independent assignment.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. For SIFE students, we use strategic grouping and modified texts. Vocabulary is more explicitly taught to these students. SIFE 
students also receive more explicit instruction around phonics and pronouncing words, connecting to any prior knowledge 
they may have with the Chinese phonetic system. Connections to what the student already knows and building background 
are emphasized at a greater degree for our SIFE students. 
b. Our newcomers are assessed first. Some students arrive with stronger levels of English proficiency, depending on their 
previous schooling in China. Instruction is differentiated for these groups based on their strengths and weaknesses in modality, 
their vocabulary proficiency and speed in acquisition. Some skills, grammar, and vocabulary are more explicity taught than 
others. 
c. For our developing ELLs, we look at available data and our own baseline assessments to determine which modalities and 
areas of English language acquisition they still need work on. Typically, for this subgroup of ELLs, we focus on vocabulary 
development for academic English and reading comprehension for more complex texts, in addition to targeted writing skills. 
Orally, grouping strategies,  and grammar and vocabulary taught and repeated in context are emphasized.  
d. For long-term ELLs, we would likewise look at available data and baseline assessments to determine what areas to focus on 
for this subgroup. Long term ELLs tend to be more orally communicative but need skills development with reading 
comprehension and writing in academic English. In our school, long-term ELLs may also have had interrupted schooling, 
beginning ENL in the US and then returning to their home countries for a few years before re-entering the NYC school system. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Diagnosing needs first with our own assessments allows us to differentiate for this subgroup better. 
e. For Former ELLs, they are provided supports in their ELA classrooms (e.g. strategic grouping, specific feedback around 
grammar and vocabulary acquisition, etc.) They have an ENL period every other day that provides time for independent 
reading and continued literacy support. They are also aware of the accommodations provided to them during standardized 
exams. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers modify texts or offer a range of texts to meet needs of ELLs and ELL-SWDs. Additional strategies include chunking 
texts or reducing or extending the length of texts while walking students through text complexity through think alouds and 
modeling. Teachers also assist with note taking by having different levels of graphic organizers for ELL-SWDs. Within our 
inclusive environment, ELL-SWDs also benefit from cooperative learning activities in all classrooms. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Curricular flexibility: teachers revise their units and curriculum maps throughout the year. Skills that need to be spiralled are 
added to future lessons and unit plans. 
Instructional flexibility: teachers are responsible for checking for understanding. The pace of lessons, the groupings, and 
teaching strategies are all modifiable. 
Scheduling flexibility: our ENL classes are offered at the same time of day to allow for acceleration or remediation. We also 
individually program every student. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
- For SIFE students and low-level beginners, we offer ENL small-group instruction. This includes after school and Saturdays. 
- After school and during lunch, tutoring is available in English and Chinese. This is by teachers or by peer tutors. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year, we are excited to expand our partnership with the Chinese American Planning Council, a local community based 
organization. Our teachers and 11th and 12th grade students, together with CPC, will be offering a "writing center," similar to 
what students might encounter in college. Students can receive support from more proficient student in completing 
assignments.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Currently, we have no programs/services being discontinued. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our support staff, three guidance counselors and parent coordinator, are bilingual in English and Chinese. Both the principal 
and assistant principal are proficient in Chinese as well. The school provides a welcoming community where the educational 
experiences and language backgrounds of all our students are valued. All supplemental services, and the communication 
around the availability of these services, are communicated in our students' home languages.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We are an iLearn school and have close to a class set of laptop computers for students to use. This has been helpful in 
providing our ELLs access to online and mobile language supports. We are also a Google Apps for Education school. A well-
equipped bilingual reading library is also available to our students. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

As stated, nearly half of our faculty is bilingual. We work collaboratively to provide home language support in our program. We 
are able to assess for all modalities in the home language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
Resources are carefully selected and shared among teachers and guidance counselors to ensure that they correspond 
appropriately to the ages and grade levels of our students. Authentic texts and adapted texts that are highly engaging are both 
used. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
As needed and available, we may offer home language classes to students who share our campus. AP classes are also shared 
across the campus. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the beginning of the school year, we offer a student and family orientation where students meet each other for the first 
time. This is coordinated by guidance counselors, the parent coordinator, and administration. This orientation is offered in 
English and Chinese. New students to the school are paired with a buddy to help them get acquainted with the school 
environment and procedures. Students also elect a Chinese-speaking and English-speaking president and the same for 
secretaries. This helps ensure that our ELLs are incorporated into our school community. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We offer Chinese Native Language Arts and AP Chinese.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
As a school that is designed to serve a large population of ELLs, all teachers are expected to use ENL strategies in their 
classrooms. At the end of August, we run one week of  professional development, attended by close to 100% of the staff, 
around meeting the needs of our unique student body. This PD included: 
•     a workshop by our ELL coordinator and ENL teacher, introducing and modeling classroom best practices, highlighting 
points from Making Content Comprehensible: the SIOP Model. We also discuss strategies for reading and writing that support 
achievement of the Common Core Standards. 
•     workshops emphasized how important it is that teachers intentionally plan groupwork and cooperative learning in lessons, 
allowing our ELLs time to process new content in their home languages, and checking for understanding for all students, 
especially ELLs (our school wide goal for 2015-16) 
•     training for how to talk to new students, especially ELLs (both newly immigrated and those who were present for middle 
school), about high school graduation and preparing for college. We addressed how jarring the transition for students is and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

trained teachers on how to use a graphic organizer to introduce and track progress towards high school graduation 
requirements 
 
During the year, department teams ensure curriculum and assessments are scaffolded and differentiated for our various 
subgroups of ELLs. This is done via work in common plan time meetings and Friday afternoon PDs. During this time, teachers 
examine student work,  workshop unit plans and assessments, and provide one another with feedback on lessons.  
  
With reference to the CCLS, much of this curriculum and instructional work, is done in teacher teams. Department leads plan 
agendas and lead teachers in reviewing student work relative to CCLS-aligned state and teacher-made assessments, discussing 
scaffolds and differentiation for ELLs. Teachers are also encouraged to attend professional development offered by the Office 
of ELLs, particularly around the CCLS.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
This minimum has been more than fulfilled through our summer PD, explained above, common planning time for department 
teaming and after school PDs, via an SBO voted on by our teachers. For all meetings, agendas, attendance, and minutes are 
kept and shared digitally with the entire teaching faculty.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our bilingual guidance counselors, ENL teachers, and our parent coordinator help ELLs with the transition from middle school 
to high school during the summer. In late August/early September, we administer the NYSITELL and review results with 
newcomer students and families. We do the same once NYSESLAT results are published.  
 
Our guidance counselors also work closely with teachers to identify students who may be in need of more counseling in 
regards to the transition to high school. In addition to parent meetings throughout the year for our neediest students, we plan 
to schedule an additional meeting after the fall term to discuss progress. These will take place in January and February, most 
likely over January Regents week. These will be scheduled by the ENL and Chinese language team, with the support of 
guidance counselors and our parent coordinator. 
 
Records are kept via sign in sheets and feedback forms. Meetings are documented via our shared online appointment spread 
sheet. Outreach is documented via Skedula.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Together with Asian Americans for Equality, a community based organization, we provide workshops for our ELL parents and 
students. We parallel our workshops for students (during the day or at the same time as PTA meetings) with our workshops for 
parents. This helps facilitate conversation within the family. We are responsive to our parents' needs, providing essential 
information like health and financial service info via AAFE, in addition to informing parents about the education their students

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Melanie Lee, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The school uses the home language survey, the RHLA report from ATS, and our own data from orientation and 
mailings to assess the translation and interpretation needs of our school's families. Our office staff is able to speak 
English, Spanish, Cantonese, and Mandarin Chinese, and all mailings sent home are translated into the three 
languages.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

rights and guide to language access are provided to all during family orientations and then in the main office when 
parents visit the school.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We survey parents in their home language throughout the year, asking for feedback after each meeting and more 
informally at the end of phone calls (asking if they received documents mailed home, etc.). We also review the annual 
school survey.
