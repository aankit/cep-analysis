Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The Mott Hall School is dedicated to the academic and personal development of students who will become 
tomorrow’s leaders in mathematics, science, and technology. Students are challenged to question, to anticipate, to 
problem-solve, to assume personal responsibility to build strong character. Scholars will emerge as enthusiastic life-
long learners and independent thinkers who are motivated by the pursuit of academic excellence and social 
responsibility.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Mott Hall School is dedicated to the academic and personal development of students who will become 
tomorrow’s leaders. In the classrooms and corridors, there is a dynamic educational process shared between 
innovative teachers and eager students. This process reflects the dedication to student empowerment and inculcates 
the love of learning that underlines the school’s mission and spirit. 

Mott Hall’s holistic approach to student learning, which is focused upon academic rigor combined with life skills, helps 
to ensure that graduates become life-long learners and achievers. In a family atmosphere which is both caring and 
firm, students are challenged by a thought provoking scholastic program. At Mott Hall, students are nurtured and 
enriched with activities that foster their development throughout adolescence and are instilled with qualities that 
extend throughout their lives. 

There are currently 290 students enrolled in the school. The students’ racial demographics are as follows: 81% of 
students are Hispanic, 10% are Black, 5% are White, 2% of students are Asian, and 1% is multi-racial.  

We prepare our students for life after middle school and high school. Mott Hall partners with Urban Advantage, 
Columbia University and City College. These programs supplement our instructional programs. Parents appreciate 
that we offer challenging academic programs that provide students with a well-rounded education. We believe that 
our students are best developed when supported by the collaborative efforts of educators, parents, community 
organizations and students. Mott Hall has a compliment of academic and enrichment courses, such as regents, high 
school prep. classes, ELA and math skills classes, foreign language, music, arts, chess, dance, orchestra and sports. Our 
collaboration with Sports and Arts Foundation provides our community educational and enrichment offerings such as 
fencing, pottery-making, team athletics, Study Island, dance, tutoring and Regents prep. In addition, our students are 
charged with giving back to their communities through our Service Learning Program.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

12% of enrolled students are Students with Disabilities. In 2016-2017, 95% of students were eligible for the Free 
Lunch program .025% of students are English Language Learners.  

Our students with disability disabilities and ELLs needs include vocabulary development, reading fluency and 
comprehension skills, and problem solving skills. In support of their achievement, we will provide them Expanding 
Learning Opportunities through peer tutoring, teacher tutoring (during and after school), computer programs, 
Saturday trips aligned to curriculum and the ELA and Math Saturday Academy. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In the past year Mott Hall made the most progress in teacher collaboration and in delivering rigorous instruction.  

Mott Hall’s school-wide goal throughout the years has been to continually build consistency in instruction across the 
school to support higher achievement. During the 2017-2018 school year, our main goal was to continue to improve 
our literacy in all content areas and math instructional practices with the strategic use of assessment data to 
effectively target students with special needs and English Language Learners. In order to enhance our practices, each 
year many of our goals have been built upon each other. In planning around our areas of need (math, academic rigor 
in all disciplines and better meeting the needs of our students), our instructional focus for 2018-2019 is to strengthen 
our shared practices across all disciplines by using formative and summative assessments in all CCLS lessons, rigorous 
tasks, and collaborating and learning from one another to improve teacher practices as evidenced by Danielson’s 
Framework and the Depth of Knowledge.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our school’s 2018 NYS Exam scores for English Language Arts and Mathematics surpassed citywide averages and were 
higher than all our in-district schools with similar demographics. 77% of students met State standards on the NYS ELA 
test, and 82% met State standards on the NYS Math test. The percentage of students scoring at Level 1 and Level 2 on 
the ELA exam dropped from 32% to 23% The percentage scoring at Level 1 and Level 2 in Math dropped from 33% to 
18%. 

 

After conducting a three-year trend analysis of student performance data on state assessments in ELA and Math, it 
was determined that though our ELA performance is 77%, we had a school-wide decrease of 2% including special 
populations. Though 82% of our students are proficient in math and this represents a significant increase in math 
performance, we need to further increase our math rigor and accelerate our programs so that ALL students are 
prepared to take the Algebra Regents in the 8th grade.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the last 3 years, our school has strengthened the practice of professional learning communities. Based on the 2016-
2017 PPO visits, teacher teams were not using coherent protocols to look at student work to improve student 
performance. In 2017-2018, we began to consistently utilize protocols in our department teams. Teachers 
implemented the practice of using protocols to analyze student work products, trends and next steps to inform 
instruction and raise student achievement. The majority of our teachers are engaged in structured, inquiry-based 
collaborations that promote student achievement.  

An analysis of MOTP ratings indicate a progression towards meeting highly effective levels in component 3D (Using 
Assessment in Instruction). In 2017-2018, we increased the MOTP highly effective ratings from 20% to 30%. We are 
focused on moving students towards meeting higher standards through strategic use of assessment, analysis and 
planning.  

An analysis of student performance data on state assessments in ELA and Math, determined that ALL student groups 
need to show an increase in performance on ELA and Math assessments. Our current ELA performance is 77%, 
therefore, 23% need to show increased improvement towards meeting grade performance level. In addition, our 
performance in Math is 82%, therefore, 18% need to show increased improvement towards meeting grade 
performance level.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 85 % of teachers will rate effectively or higher on 3d of the Danielson Rubric.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The Mott Hall community has a population of diverse learners and would benefit from a collaborative system 
involving all stakeholders. We believe that it is the school’s responsibility to facilitate communication between 
teachers and families. Our community also believes that an increase in parent involvement and awareness of 
academic expectations and support resources will result in an improved academic achievement. 

 

Currently, a low percentage of parents are actively engaged in school events. We have challenges – working class 
parents who may not have the time to attend events, language, communication and information not reaching 
parents. We are working towards a genuine involvement from all of our families. All families have access to Pupil 
Path, the schools on line grading system, which allows both parents and students to view grades. In addition, Pupil 
Path is used as a communication system between parents and teachers, and teachers and students, which promotes 
on-going communication between teachers and parents regarding student progress. 

After conducting a three-year trend analysis of parent involvement and community ties, it was determined that 
although our numbers of parents have increased we need to continue to increase our parental involvement. Our 
Learning Environment Survey indicates that 25% of our parents reported that they did not participate in school-wide 
events. In addition, 30% of parents indicated that they wanted ‘better communication with the school.’ 

 

As a result we have made increased parental involvement as one of our goals for this school year. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Time-bound.  
By June 2019, the number of parents who participate in school-wide events will increase by 10% as evidenced by the 
Learning Environment indicator.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

Collaborate with District 6, NYCDOE, and local universities to recruit highly qualified staff. 100% of teachers are 
assigned appropriate to their license/certification. Reach out to network and NYCDOE for high quality professional 
development. 

 

Recruitment 

School leaders enter vacancies on the New Teacher Finder, and attend job fairs to recruit qualifying candidates. 

The personnel committee for recruitment and hiring purposes is formed. The responsibilities of this committee are: to 
screen applications and resumes, interview qualified candidates, observe demonstration lessons and provide 
feedback to candidates. The final decision on hiring is collaborative. 

 

Retention / Assignments 

School Leaders assign payroll secretary to ensure that all teachers meet documentation requirements that are kept on 
file. Payroll secretary works closely with the Field Support Center’s Director of Human Resources to ensure that all 
teachers meet all documentations and assessment deadlines. School leaders regularly check in with teachers to assess 
their teaching environment, continued passion on working with students and social emotional needs. Depending on 
the content areas, teachers usually receive assignments within the same grade level.

School has a structure with different components to support new(er) teachers: 

1.  Mentors are assigned to support new teachers 
2.  As members of a department, teachers receive colleague support for curriculum planning, lesson modeling, 

assessment and using student data to inform instruction. 

3.  Teams collaboratively plan curriculum and units of study on weekly basis. 
4.  Through Teacher Incentive Fund (Teacher Development Program and Metamorphosis) partnership, teachers 

are supported by instructional coaches 

5.  All Teachers are instructionally supported by District 
6.  Guidance counselors, grade teams and content teams provide social and emotional support to all teachers. 

Professional learning such as workshops, after school small group learning is tailored for different teachers 

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
 

Provide targeted professional learning opportunities based on data and observed teacher needs ensuring that all staff 
is able to assist students to meet the CCSS. 

 

Ongoing Professional Development – 

1. Professional Development takes place within the school. During Professional Development days, faculty 
conferences, and at times over the weekend there are seminars provided to the teachers by their peers and by the 
administration. The Professional Development sessions include: Teaching and Learning Practices, Understanding and 
Implementing new initiatives in the department of education, Understanding and planning for student needs, 
assessment and cognitive development in adolescents. 

2. Professional Development is offered by the District 6, District Partners, Support Centers, DOE coaches and 
consultants. Throughout the year District 6 offers professional development opportunities to our teachers, 
paraprofessionals, parent coordinator, and guidance counselor. Taking place both during the school day and after 
school, the District provides PD on curriculum development, best practices, and new initiatives. In addition to training 
the staff, District 6 holds professional development seminars for Principals and Assistant Principals that focus on skill 
building, new initiatives, and in addition often includes a school visit where members engage in classroom 
observations and provide feedback.  

3. Professional Development is provided by outside organizations – Through research, district recommendation, and 
teacher recommendations, the administration provides the teachers, para professionals, and other staff members the 
opportunity to attend professional development outside of the school and network office.  

 

The focus of the professional development opportunities are: Teacher Development (Danielson), Framework for Great 
Schools, Performance Tasks, Instructional Shifts to Common core Standards, Assessment, and Curriculum 
Development 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

 

4. Due to creative programming, the school’s schedule allows for multiple opportunities for teachers to improve on 
their teaching in order to help the students meet the CCSS. Each content area department meets once a week to 
provide feedback on best practices, work on curriculum, and analyze student work. In addition to content meetings, 
grade teams also meet once a week. Within these meetings the teachers discuss best practices, identify red flag 
situations, contact parents, and plan student events. Lastly, within each department, classes are organized so that, as 
often as possible, when one teacher is teaching the others in their content area have a free period. This allows for 
inter-visitations to take place. 

 

5. Frequent Observations and Feedback – With Advance,teachers have been receiving frequent observations that lead 
to feedback based on the Danielson Rubric. With teacher goals discussed in the beginning of the year, there is a focus 
to the observations making it a priority to work on areas the teachers identified themselves as being in need of 
improvement.

All teachers have the opportunity during their regularly scheduled meetings to meet and provide research-based 
recommendations that inform the use of assessment using protocols to reach a consensus. As part of our Inquiry 
work, teachers engage in a process of looking at student work using protocols to monitor progress towards goals and 
CCSS curriculum alignment. Additionally, our Professional Development continually evolves to reflect the needs, 
ideas, and opinions of teachers, with observations of classrooms and teacher teams to ensure the teachers are 
adequately prepared to administer and analyze assessment and develop appropriate instructional strategies from the 
results. Surveys and other forms are used periodically to give teachers the opportunity to reflect on their learning and 
practice, and to give feedback that can be used to inform school-wide improvement efforts. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Mott Hall School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

The Mott Hall School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA);

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Mott Hall uses various types of assessment tools to assess the early literacy skills of the Ells.  The Q.R.I - The Qualitative 
Reading inventory is used to assess reading comprehension.  The Garnett Assessment for decoding and encoding is used to 
assess if the students can identify graphemes, phonemes and morphemes and it also assesses the ability to spell. The San 
Diego Quick assessment is used to determine reading fluency.  In addition to these specialty assessments, teachers created 
their own basesline assessments in all content areas.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Assessment on-line tracking tool, teacher teams, student protocols, professional learning, accountable measures

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  ELA and Math periodic Assessments (created by teachers on Fluence)     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teacher teams, Looking at student work protocols, measurable goals, benchmarks, differentiation strategies, tutoring, 
Saturday Academy 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The purpose of RTI in a middle school is to provide students with increasingly intensive, targeted insttruction designed to 
match their learning needs, as demonstrated by performance on periodically administered assessments.  Because of our small 
ELL population, the ESL teacher is able to tailor instruction to the needs of individual students based on their needs as seen in 
classroom assessments,   State assessments and classroom baseline assessments.  In addition, the ESL teacher participates in 
both departmental and grade meetings where students with particular needs are discussed.  This tiered system allows for the 
development of additional supports for ELL students, when appropriate. 
  
Mott Hall implements the RTI framework by having a three tiered system which focuses on strong core instruction, intensive 
targeted intervention and progress monitoring for Mott Hall ELLs. The ENL teacher and students collaborate jointly by 
constructing knowledge that provides students with oportunities to engage with one another and with their teacher around 
rigorous academic content. Language and Literacy is develped across the curriculum.  The ENL teacher pushes into the four 
core subjects once a week for the students .  She works directly with the Ells' teachers collaborating with them to ensure that 
the students are achieving to the best of their ability.  In addition, students are afforded an opportunity to work directly with 
the ENL teacher on language acquision as well as content area in a stand-alone environment. The ENL teacher taps into the 
students' prior schema so that students can relate to whatever  is being taught.  The ENL teacher targets academically rigorous 
and challenging instructional goals while providing students with the appropriate instructional supports to meet the student's 
needs.  The ENL teacher uses differentiation to address the Ells language concerns and cultural differences.   
  
 As mentioned in  paragraph 1 of this section, The ENL teacher uses data analyses from NYSESLAT exams, state tests, unit tests, 
and chapter tests.   The textbook for ESL students is used in the classroom to measure students ability to write specific types of 
essays, and short answer responses.  Reading comprehension and speaking proficiency is measured with the same 
tool.  Students are given a periodic assessment for NYSESLAT in the fall and then again in the Spring which measures reading, 
writing, listening and speaking.  the ENL teacher gets a good idea of how her students are progressing and targets instruction 
accordingly.  She also uses formative assessments in the classroom to assess the Ells progress.  The Ells have self-assessment 
sheets that they fill out.  There are grammar sheets used along with conversation and the ENL Teacher uses classroom 
observations to assess students.  Furthermore, the ENL teacher keeps a data binder on the students' progress with "next 
steps" to focus on for better student achievement and fluency in the English language.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
All 10 (ten) students at Mott Hall are a mixed level with 70% of the students scoring "Expanding", 10% scoring "Transitioning" 
and 20% of the students scoring "Emerging".  There are five (5) eighth graders in the ELL program. All of the eighth graders are 
considered students with disabilities; three of whom are in an integrated co-teaching setting and two students who are in a 
selfl-containned setting.  At this time, there are no seventh graders in the ENL program.  There are five(5) sixth graders in the 
ENL program:  All of the sixth graders are considered students with disabilities.  Three of whom are in self-contained class and 
two of whom are in an integrated co-teaching class.  Two of the sixth graders in the self-contained class scored Expanding 
while one scored Emerging.  In the sixth grade ICT class, one student scored  Emerging and  the other scored Expanding.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Teacher teams, google docs, observation feedback conferences, coach conferences

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered as both an ENL standalone and an integrated delivery ENL.  All students are required to take 
180 minutes of ENL per week.  Mrs. McMahon visits grades 6 or grade 8 academic classes for either SS, ELA, Science & 
SS one period per day depending on the need of the student.  There is also a pull- out 4 periods a week.   The four pull 
out periods are mixed proficiency level and mixed grade.   This ensures that all students are getting the best possible 
instruction in English Acquisition and the core content area so that students will be able to show progress and 
proficiency in acquisision of English.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

n/a 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           The program model is a heterogeneous, ungraded model.  It is based on 45 minutes of instruction blocks of time.  Each 
child receives the prescribed instruction time which is as follows for each level:  Entering- 540 minutes per week , Emerging -
360 minutes per week, Transitioning-180 minutes per week, Expanding- 180 minutes per week and Commanding - 90 minutes 
per week for two additional years after testing out of ENL.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The language of instruction is English for all of the content areas.  A multi-modality approach is used- students have different 
learning intelligences and each one of the 7 intelligences of Howard Gardiner are used in a unit .  All classes are differentiated 
to meet the needs of the individual student. In Stand Alone ENL - we use content area texts, worksheets, and supplementary 
materials, word charts with illustrations, etc.  to facilitate the learning process.  We are currently using 2 workbooks in Stand 
alone ENL :  The title of one of the workbooks is New York ELLs - Grade 6,7,8 published by Continental, the other book is 
National Geographic Academic Vocabulary Toolkit by Dr. Kate Kinsella.   Games are played to facilitate grammatical 
knowledge. 
  
         Ms. McMahon works collaboratively with the content area teachers.  She speaks to the teachers to ask what they want 
her to focus on for each student prior to the lessons being taught.  She develops vocabulary charts and lessons that benefit the 
Ell students both in the Content class as well as in the stand alone class.  
  
        When Ms. McMahon co-teaches with the Content Area teachers, she uses saffolding and various visual aids such as 
graphic organizers to faciltate the writing process.  These organisers vary from venn diagrams to KWL charts, to story maps, 
fishbone maps, etc.  In addition, Ms. McMahon taps into the student's prior schema to make the student familiar with 
experiences in his/her own life which will then create a way for the student to understand from his own perspective what is

being taught.   
       
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   There are no students who need native language arts.  All instruction is in English.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

6A)  A SIFE student will receive intensive English language development instruction teaching social and academic 
language.  They will receive intensive literacy development and sheltered content instruction.  The schedules for teachers will 
becom e double period/block scheduling to facilitate the SIFE's learning.  In addition many pictures will be used to facilitate the 
learning for the student who is a SIFE student along with periodic assessment, formative assessments such as writing, 
reading,listening and speaking assessments.   
A curriculum will be developed for SIFE students based on state academic standards, concentrating on essential knowledge 
and skills onlly.  Teachers will collaborate to modify curriculum.  Students will have modified scheduling and condensed 
remedial courses that can catch students up to their grade levels in ELA, Math, Science, and Social Studies.  
Students will receive explicit studying skills and extended day opportunities.  After school tutorials and programs will be 
offered. Individual tutoring:  Volunteers will be invited to be tutors for SIFE students such as college students, high school 
students, teachers, community volunteers. 
6B.  Students here less than three (3) years will be given vocabulary words to facilitate learning in the content area.  They will 
also read, write, listen and speak everyday that they are in the ESL class.  Teacher will asked questions that require one word 
answers, shewill scaffold instruction to facilitate ELLs as well as administer older NYSESLAT Exams to aid in focusing on where 
the student needs more help. The focus on the newcomer is to help them acquire a stronger understanding of academic 
Englisih.   In addition, many different strategies will be used such as games, venn diagrams, t-charts, etc.  technology, tapping 
into the student's prior knowledge and experiences .  Mrs. McMahon will work closely with content area teachers and, 
particularly, ELA teachers to ensure that students' needs will be addressed and preparation for the test is maximized through 
repetition of ELA materials.  (Listening, speaking, reading, and writing).  These measures will guarantee a higher rate of success 
for the early ELL students.   
6C.  In accordance with their scores in NYSESLAT, students with four (4) or six (6) years of service will be placed in the 
appropriate ENL level of instruction where they will receive help in content area as well as English grammar, speaking, reading, 
writing, and listening. 
6D.  Long term ELLS would receive instruction based on their academic needs in the content area as well as their NYSESLAT 
scores (RLSW).  The Nyseslat scores will focus  on what their weaknesses and strengths are, thereby, driving the appropriate 
instruction  for each individual student.  Ms. McMahon will work with content area teachers to help students achieve 
competency in common core standards and to test out of the ENL program . 
6E.  Our plan for former ELLS who have tested as "Commanding" will include extended time (time and a half) on state tests and 
school tests.  The use of a bilingual dictionary, and another place to take the test will be given to accommodate former ELLs if 
they want to have this accomodation.   In addition, former ELLs must have ENL instruction 90 minutes a week. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ESL strategies used coincide with Howard Gardiner's theory of multiple intelligences: visual, auditory, kinesthetic, 
interpersonal, and intrapersonal learning.  ESL teacher will use the six different types of scaffolding:  Modeling, bridging, 
contextualization, text representation, schema building and metacognitive development.  ESL teacher will incorporate 
technology into the classroom, as well as games,graphic organizers and word walls.  The ESL teacher will work with all content 
area teachers to facilitate the ELLs learning in the content area.  In addition, the teachers are incorporating the school wide 
goal of argumentative and persuasive writing,with rubrics for students to develop their writing skills.  , 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Because the ELL population in the school is only 4% of the student population (10 students- 10 swds, 5 ICTs and 5 Special 
Education Self-Contained, Ms. McMahon is able to cordinate with the students'content area teachers as well as the two special 
education self-contained teachers (Ms. David and Ms. Jackson) to aid in developing the student's writing skillls as well as their 
content area knowledge.  Ms. McMahon determined the period of instruction for pull-out services that would cause the least 
instructional interruption.  She also collaborates with content area and special education teachers in assessing ELL student 
understanding of the skills and concepts taught in the curriculum. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted intervention services for ELLs in ELA, Math and other content areas for all ELLs subgroups (special education, 
general education,  and all 5 levels of proficiency for NYSESLAT) are administered in a seventh and eighth grade AIS(academic 
intervention support) program twice a week for each grade during the school day.  In addition to AIS,  there is an increase of 
Math and ELA periods from 5 periods to 8 periods per week, a sixth and seventh grade writing class two times a week and an 
after school tutoring program through SASF.  As of January, 2015  there will be Science, Math Regents and French tutoring.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Next year 2017-2018, we will consider grade level stand alone classes in conjunction with the integrated delivery model.  We 
will supply new  consumable grade level ESL workbooks, textbooks, and computer programs.  We will have an English library 
for each level as well as a Spanish Library for each level.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We don’t' plan on eliminating or discontinuing any Ell services next year.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Because the Ell population is so small, our Ells have access to the same programs as the general education population.  All 
Mott Hall students have the opportunity to participate in  the after school tutoring program and all seventh and eighth graders 
have the option of Academic Intervention Services. We particularly emphasize small group instruction of our Ell 
population.  Enrichment activities such as NDI, yearbook, Chess club, digital library, after school sports club.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Classroom libraries and a digital library are provided for students to select books that are appropriate to their level of reading. 
Technology (digital library, laptop computers with appropriate Ell programs  in every classroom,  Smart Board instruction) are 
given to students.  All instruction in Mott Hall incorporates technology into each class.  Bilingual books and dictionaries are 
available to the Spanish speaking Ell.  In addition, French is taught to all students at Mott Hall.  This enables the Spanish 
speaking ESL student to make connections between their native language and French.  Students make connections between 
the two romance languages and to grammatical structure.  Students become more  familiar with parts of speech, cognates, 
etc. in English, French and Spanish.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

There is a minimal amount of native language support.  Some of the school staff (secretaries, parent coordinator and teachers) 
speak Spanish.  These people can offer assistance to the ESL student, outside of the classroom, if necessary.  Academically, 
students have acces to Spanish bilingual dictionaries and some native reading materials.  Seventh and Eighth grade students 
are all offered French.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

Counseling and Speech are given at age and grade appropriateness.  Counseling is offered to all middle school Ell students to 
facilitate the Ell student's adjustments to middle school.  Counseling is offered to help students and their families prepare for 
entry into high schooland address any emotional or social needs that the students may have.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Classroom libraries and a digital library are provided for students to select books that are appropriate to their level of reading. 
Technology (digital library, laptop computers with appropriate Ell programs  in every classroom,  Smart Board instruction) are 
given to students.  All instruction in Mott Hall incorporates technology into each class.  Bilingual books and dictionaries are 
available to the Spanish speaking Ell.  In addition, French is taught to all students at Mott Hall.  This enables the Spanish 
speaking ESL student to make connections between their native language and French.  Students make connections between 
the two romance languages and to grammatical structure.  Students become more  familiar with parts of speech, cognates, 
etc. in English, French and Spanish.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
There is a curriculum orientation meeting for parents as well as for the students at the beginning and the end of 
year.   Students are supported via regular counseling sessions with Ms. Benjamin. Some Ell students can receive up to 2x a 
week of counseling.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

French is the only language offered to the seventh and eighth grade students at The Mott Hall School. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The professional development plan for all Ell personnel at Mott Hall is as follows: 
-  Teachers have opportunities to attend any regional and/or city-wide workshops to further their professional development. 
-  Teacher training in best practices in ENL instruction and collaborative inquiry focus. 
-  Professional Development days are offered in house which reinforce teaching to the Common Core Standards. 
  
All teachers receive professional development from our Administration, Professional Development teams, Department 
Liaisons, Teacher Development City Initiative, District Professional Development, Manhattan Instructional Support Team, 
Metamorphosis and licensed ESL teacher). This staff development consists of data analysis, looking at student work to 
determine next steps, strategies, resources, instructional decisions and program. All classroom teachers also receive extensive 
training in developing coherent practices around curriculum planning, assessment, progress monitoring, rubrics, protocols for 
collaboratively working on a team in understanding language development and writing.  This informs teacher practice and 
instructional supports for students.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

  
Literacy professional development is ongoing throughout the year and occurs once a week and during Monday PD for 
teachers. All math teachers also receive staff development from our Metamorphosis and District Six on an on-going bases. 
Metamorphosis and administration support teachers in the implementation of a curriculum aligned with the Common Core 
Learning Standards. The Metamorphosis Coach meets with teachers at least twice a month for 3 periods each time.  Our 
teachers are also receiving professional development in the Danielson rubric by the Principal and Assistant Principal as they 
turn-key the information that they are trained in by the District. This professional development is ongoing, targeted to and 
occurs each week on Mondays for 80 minutes. Our staff has already received training in aligning our curriculum to the 
Common Core Learning Standards.  
  
In department teams, teachers have examined the Common Core Learning Standards for all content areas. Together, they have 
examined the curriculum against the Common Core Learning Standards to identify any gaps or areas in need of improvement. 
We have added vocabulary development, essential questions and differentiated instructional grouping to our units of study in 
writing to support our ELLs in the advanced vocabulary requirement of the Common Core Learning Standards. We use fully 
aligned curricula for all our students.  We will continue this support throughout the year as per our professional development 
schedule.  In addition, the majority of our classroom teachers have received training in Differentiated Instruction. This training 
will be available for new teachers as per our Rewards school plan. This year we will request ELL training from our ELL 
Instructional Specialist to complete the 7.5 hours of ELL training for all staff and 10 hours of training for Special Education 
teachers. All records for ELL training will be maintained in a binder in the Principal's office along with the agendas for each 
meeting.  
  
The Testing Coordinator attends professional development twice per year given by the NYC Assessment Implementation 
Director. The Guidance Counselor receives professional development from the network monthly. Paraprofessionals are 
included in the training during professional development days. All of our classroom teachers have received smart board 
training. This training is on-going and is provided by our technology teacher. The interactive applications on the Smart Board 
serve to scaffold the second language learner's understandings. Our teachers have all been invited to take advantage of the 
training that is available on ENGAGE and all of our teachers know how to navigate that system.  
  
Our Parent Coordinator has attended workshops on Conflict Resolution, Resources in the Community, Translation, Literacy, 
Technology, ELL strategies, Balanced Literacy, Common Core Standards,  and Math Curriculum. These workshops have helped 
our Parent Coordinator to gain more information and support her work with parents.  
  
The training for teachers of ELLs includes ESL strategies (simplified language, Total Physical Response, slower speech) and 
language acquisition theories and ELL policies. This training is on-going and given by the administration during professional 
development days, and during pre and post observation conferences.  
  
  
  
Our mission to support our students’ language acquisition by scaffolding content so that they can assess information and build 
language, content and skills. To that end, our teachers have studied the CCLS and have aligned the content area curriculum to 
the standards. They have received professional development in the CCLS and in aligning the curricula to include differentiation 
in all units of study. All teachers receive on-going professional development from Admin. , professional team and department 
liaisons.  
  
  
 Furthermore, ESL teachers have the opportunity to attend outside professional development specifically on topics that will 
benefit Ells and their learning.  ESL teachers return from their outside PD's and turn-key the information to the rest of the 
staff.  
   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Ms. Benjamin (the guidance couselor) gives IEPS of all students in the ESL program to ESL teachers and the teaching staff.  This 
makes the ESL teacher aware of students individual needs and the IEP dictates the way the student is taught.   Ell training takes 
place during faculty and departmental meetings.  In addition, The Mott Hall School must form a language proficiency team for 
students entering NYS public schools with an IEP to determine if the student has language acquisition needs and should take 
the NYSITELL . 
  
Our teachers collaborate as a grade team and a department team.  Our goal is to support the transition into middle school as 
well as transition into high school.  We recently hired an additional guidance counselor to join the team.  One guidance 
counselor supports HS articulation and the other middle school transition. They each work with parents and students. The HS 
articulation counselor meets with parents and students as a group and individually to orient them on the high school selection 
process.  She schedules school visits and coordinates teacher support for recommendations and essay writing.  All our students 
receive support in preparing for Specialized HS exams.  All our students take the exam. The middle school counselor supports 
our incoming 6th grade students in transitioning into our school. Orientation meetings, team building activities and “budding” 
is organized to support our students. Our students are supported academically, socially and emotionally.  We also host school 
tours for current 5th graders interested in learning more about our school. We establish a relationship with elementary school 
guidance counselors and have a school tour for them, followed by tours for all families interested in joining our community. 
Resources used in our meetings (brochure, pamphlets, powerpoint) are all translated into Spanish.  One of our counselors is 
Bilingual, as well as our parent coordinator. They are able to present and support parents in their native language.  
  
The PD plan outlined below meets the minimum timeline requirements for ESL teacher and the teaching staff.  There will be 
many opportunities for the ESL teacher to meet the 50% requirement of required hours for pd this year.  Many of Mott Hall's 
professional development consists of differentiation of learning, co-teaching strategies, and teaching content area aligned to 
the common core.  In addition, the ESL teacher will attend outside professional development workshops particularly targeted 
towards language acquisition and content instruction of the Ell.  When approprpriate, these workshops are turn-keyed to the 
appropriate staff during the aforementioned faculty, departmental or grade meetings. 
Our professional development time takes place on Monday (80 minutes).  Other professional development opportunities occur 
in weekly department, weekly grade teams and targeted PD. We use some of these periods to accomplish the professional 
development requirements as per CR Part 154. We provide professional development to all teachers and administrators that 
specifically addresses the needs of English language learners. We dedicate a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required 
professional development hours to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners. For all bilingual and English as a new language 
teachers we dedicate a minimum of fifty percent (50%) of the required professional development hours to language 
acquisition in alignment with core content area instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and 
integrating language and content instruction for English language learners.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
           

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parental involvement means the participation of all parents in regular, two-way and meaningful communication involving 
student academic learning and other school activities, including, and ensuring that parents play an integral role in assisting 
their child'slearning.  Parents are encouraged to be actively involved in their child's education at school.  Because parents are 
full partners in their child's education, they are included , as appropriate, in decision making and on advisory committees to 
assist in the education of their child.  Our parent coordinator, Ms. Moran, acts as liaison to school, parents, faculty and 
students.  She offers sponeaneous translation for all meetings such as PTA, SLT and manated meetings.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Judith De Los Santos, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order for the school to provide the parents with adequate communication and assess our written and oral 
translation needs, the school generates a report from ATS (RAPL). This report indicates what language the parents 
prefer to receive information from the school. The school also sends surveys home at the beginning of the school 
year asking parents if the information has changed. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

academic enrichment, music, dance, sports, writing, etc. The after 
school applications are translated so that the information is 
accessible and families can be a part of this great after school 
opportunity. In the beginning of the year and during parent teacher 
conferences in Sept., Nov., March and May, we have translated 
versions of student syllabi, curriculum and promotional policy, as well 
as a translated calendar of New York State tesing dates. Finally, our 
PTA executive board disseminate information to parents that is 
always translated (from election, to workshops to fundraising to goal-
setting. During the Learning Evironment Survey time information is 
also sent to parents in their language of preference.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as

Month/Frequency 

of Meetings  

How does 
your school 

We meet with parents several times throughout the year. At the end 
of the year and prior to school opening, we host an orientation 
meetings to discuss materials needed, home connections, parent 
outreach structures, school and doe policies, academic-social-
emotional supports and resources. In September, we meet with 
parents during Curriculum Night to discuss goals, parent and student 
supports, school instructional focus. In November, we host parent 
teacher conferences and inform parents of academic progress, areas 
of improvement and next steps. In March, we have another 
opportunity to meet with parents to discuss student progress, 
benchmark reached and provide parents additonal information 
regarding testing and how to best support our students. In May, we 
have a final parent teacher conference to discuss goals met in the 
current academic year, focus areas and provide summer supports 
and programs, as well as give students packets. Throughout the year, 
Tuesdays are used for Parent Outreach and support students' 
academic and social growth. The PTA and parent coordinator partner 
to offer parent workshops (academic support, CCLS, communication, 
testing, performance assessments, middle school development 
stages). The counselor with the support of a part time counselor, call 
and meet with parents periodically to discuss high school articulation, 
admissions, opportunities, scholarships, crisis management, IEP, etc. 
The part time counselor was hired because we realized we had a 
bilingual need.

the quality of our ELL instructional program and services. In addition, the principal has quarterly roundtable breakfast 
with parents to discuss quality of schoolwide programs and services. The feedback is captured and next steps are 
provided to modify or continue our practices.
