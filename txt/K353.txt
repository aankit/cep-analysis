Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is to promote and sustain high levels of academic achievement for all of our students, by understanding 
their individual needs and personalizing the instructional process to positively impact learning outcomes. Given a 
rigorous and nurturing environment, students will be able to think judiciously and analytically; absorb useful 
information, discuss world events, pose thoughtful questions, and develop a sense of civic duty. Ultimately, students 
will be life-long learners who are able to perform, produce and compete effectively in the global marketplace of the 
twenty-first century technological age.

school with grades Pre K through 5. There are three Integrated Co-Teaching classes (one per grade). Three general 
education classes which comprises of one grade six, one grade seven and one grade eight general education class.  

 

Vision 

We envision our school as a community where students are actively engaged in the learning process through 
interdisciplinary, technology-based instruction, project-based learning, enrichment programs, extracurricular 
activities, visual and performing arts. We expect students at MS 353 to tap into and develop their individual passions, 
in an environment that empowers them to be viable assets in their global community. Students develop good 
citizenship through local and international community service projects by proactively responding to needs within their 
society. 

 

Strategic Collaboration 

The school climate is collaborative and comprised of a dedicated community of learners. Led by an Administrative 

team of Principal, Assistant Principal and teacher leaders, all members of the school community are actively involved 

in the education of our children and have been extremely supportive. All staff members intentionally collaborate and 

have a strong commitment to improving student achievement by increasing student engagement in all content areas.

Library, New York Cares, New York Edge, Learning Gardens and the Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation. These 

partnerships aid in supporting the school's mission. 

 

To provide all students with high quality learning experiences, the school has integrated all of the city's mandated 

literacy and mathematics programs across the grades, with ongoing use of Common Core Learning Standards 

curriculum materials in all subject areas. In addition, our school provides a variety of day and after-school services 

that address the academic, as well as social and emotional needs of our students. These support services include 
Academic Intervention Services with individualized student support via the push-in and pull-out programs, guidance 
referrals, and peer mediation. 

To provide ENL students with support, the school builds the progressive language proficiency development through 
push in and pull out services in standalone classroom. ELL students of all proficiency levels share the same curriculum 
with general education students and follow their individual language goals in listening, speaking, reading and writing. 
ELL students take mandated time of ENL services, texts and student activities modifications, writing support in forms 
of sentence frames and target vocabulary work. To build essential social-emotional relationship in school, ELL 
students have opportunities to interact with native English speakers inside and outside the classroom. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

There are 63 Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) students and 23 English Language Learner (ELL) students. These 

students are mainstreamed in age appropriate grades and all students have access to a full time Guidance Counselor.  

ELL special population of the school includes SIFE students and ENL students with IEPs. The specific needs of ELL 

students in school are: to build positively friendly social relationship with peers and teachers and be an active part 

of Social, Emotional Learning in culturally-responsive school community. They need extra support in academics and 

educational environment in forms of visuals, anchor charts, videos, translation devices and special computerized 

programs.

We will strive to provide consistent explicit teaching, with opportunities for students to self-select roles/tasks with 
scaffolded strategies as needed to ensure access for all students to engage in rigorous tasks. 
 
Based on the data we have analyzed, we will support the students in our school by providing:  

 
 

 
 
 

timely and actionable feedback with a ‘follow up’ strategy 
students with multiple entry points, along with necessary scaffolds to support diverse learners, in order to 
access common core learning standards. 
students with more opportunities to read and analyze informational texts 
sufficiently challenging question sequences for our students.  
Students with groups of appropriate tiers according to their academic capabilities in order to improve 
engagement and rigor. 

 
Our school’s Instructional Focus is a collaborative approach to triangulating 2017-2018 data points. Through 
Instructional Round Cycles, we will continue to delve further into analyzing current data points. We will utilize the 
Data-Wise Improvement Process and intentionally collaborate to improve teaching and learning through evidence-
based analysis. These steps will include the “Prepare” phase, which involves creating and maintaining a culture in 
which we collaborate effectively and use data responsibly. In the “Inquiry” phase, we will use a wide range of data 
sources, including test data, student work, and classroom observations, so that we can define a very specific 
problem of practice that we will be committed to solving. In the “Act” phase, our teams will articulate how 
students will learn and utilize high-leverage strategies to address our problems, and assess the extent to which the 
plan improved outcomes. After we assess the effectiveness of our actions, we will identify needed adjustments to 
our plan and determine the focus for the next cycle of collaborative inquiry.  

 
While we strive to strengthen all of the areas of growth, we will specifically focus more on ensuring professional 
development initiatives will support teacher development and implementation of rigorous, engaging, needs-based 
Common Core Learning Standards-driven lessons. We will strive to provide high-quality instruction to improve 
student achievement. We will ensure teachers acquire skills and expertise by providing opportunities for them to 
develop, grow, and learn from peers and experts. We will develop our teachers to become strong teachers capable 
of innovation and determined to hone their practice through continuous learning and frequent professional 
development sessions to support the academic and emotional well being of all our students. These sessions will be 
facilitated by the Principal, Assistant Principal, Teacher Leads, peers, as well as consultants from District 17

Instructional team and the Brooklyn South Borough Field Instructional supports; to ensure that teacher practices 
utilize instructional strategies that support learning for all students, including English Language Learners and 
students with disabilities. 

 

In addition, we will continue to assess and adjust our curriculum aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, 
to continue to challenge our students, scaffold their experiences, and engage our students through relevant, 
cognitive engagement, rigorous tasks and high-level discussions. Our goal is to meet students where they are and 
customize rigorous instruction and strategies within and across grades. Students will learn how to become engaged 
in rigorous conversation about their work, becoming more empowered to self assess and peer assess. Furthermore, 
we will continue to utilize parent/family outreach and student learning experiences and support, to ensure the 
adoption of effective academic and personal behaviors.

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Our School strengths include: 

 

 

  We reduced the percentage of students performing at level 2 from 53% to 38% in ELA; and we increased the 

percentage of students performing at level 4 from 5% to 7%.  
In Mathematics we decreased the percentage of level 2 students from 39% to 31%. 

 
  There is a distributive leadership model with targeted goals to address every students' need. 
  Professional Development includes vertical and horizontal collaboration to ensure a quality implementation 

of the Common Core Learning Standards curricula. 

  There is a systematic plan in place to provide teachers access to pedagogical support. The implementation of 
the curriculum is closely monitored by the school leaders and they regularly examine summative assessments 
and student work. 

  Teachers use a variety of assessments data including pre, post, formative and summative assessment data 

 

across all grades and subject areas to ensure cohesiveness between the assessment tools and the curriculum 
and they revise/adjust as necessary. 
Instructional supports such as academic intervention services (AIS) built into teachers schedules, we will be 
able to provide quality support to all students by supporting students in small group individualized 
instruction. 

  Benchmarks are in place to garner data on students' academic progress. 
  The fundamental skills required to problem solve and think critically are built into the current curricula to 

 

impact learning outcomes. 
Support through on-site and off-site Professional Development are provided to teachers in order to foster 
effective instructional practices. 

  Assessments are administered quarterly in the framework of pre-assessments, benchmarks, and unit 

assessments. 

  The data derived from each assessment is used to scaffold instruction thereby impacting learning outcomes. 

Additional resources will be consistently used to supplement the CodeX (English Language Arts) and CMP3 
(Mathematics) instructional curricula.

  The 2018 NYS Common Core Learning Standards Assessments results revealed that 27% of students were 

performing at or above proficiency level in English Language Arts which was a 5% decrease from the 2017 NYS 
Common Core Learning Standards Assessment results in English Language Arts . The 2018 NYS Common Core 
Assessments in mathematics results revealed that 10% were performing at a proficiency level in Mathematics. 
We would like to see an increase of at least 25% of our students' NYS Common Core Assessments results 
indicate students performing at or above proficiency level in Mathematics. 

  Addressing the School-wide pre-assessment data results which displays less than 50% of students performing 

below standards with performance levels 1 and 2 in English Language Arts and Mathematics. 

  That our economically disadvantaged, lowest third students who are performing below proficient levels, 

utilize i-Ready diagnostic and other researched-based instructional software/strategies to improve the 
academic progress in English Language Arts and Mathematics. 

  The school utilizes the skills and expertise of the teachers and educational consultants to develop state 

aligned curricula. 

  There is continuity in conducting data analysis by school leaders, teachers and educational consultants to 

connect the standard strands to the lowest leveled performers. 

  According to the current Quality Review the pedagogical staff continue to build purposeful coherence and 

promote college and career readiness for the diversity of learners.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths 

  There are structures in place to address student’s social and emotional learning and youth development. 

School documents reflect guidance and support for students and families through various programs 

  The principal believes that building a strong culture is paramount to creating a positive learning environment. 

School leaders and faculty create and refine a theory of action statement that guides expectations and 
practice. This year’s theory is reflected in the school leader’s belief about how students learn best. School 
leaders believe that if teachers provide explicit instruction to support personalized instruction, students will 
develop self efficacy and ultimately will be successful. 

  There is a strong partnership with parents and the school provides multiple structures to communicate the 

expectations with parents and reciprocal communications are encouraged. Parents have a voice in the 
decision-making via the school leadership team. Parents are engaged in a series of specific meetings to delve 
into the Common Core Learning Standards and grade specific expectations. 

  Phone calls to parents to increase positive behavior and address the needs of individual students. 
 

Student Government Organization (SGO) participates in choosing incentives such as school dances, dress 
down days and Service Learning projects. 
Incentive system in place to reward students for positive behavior. 
Family events to reward students for Perfect Attendance, academic progress /behavior and Honor Roll. 

 
 
  Monthly meetings with staff to ensure ALL members are aware of the discipline policy. 
 

System for monitoring and responding to student social and emotional developmental and measures in place 
such as "Lunch and Learn / Flexible Academic Intervention groupings / Teacher- Team- Family Conferences" to 
ensure measures are implemented specifically for individual students if progress is not actualized.  

  Across the school community, students, teachers and families have a voice in the decision-making process for 

developing our school culture. 

School's needs based on the 2016 School Quality Guide, the Quality Review, and the NYC School Survey 

Levels of student engagement and ownership still need to be strengthened school-wide. 

 
  Adults in the building must de-escalate disruptive behavior as social-emotional challenges arise. 
  Pedagogues need more school based supports to assist in behavioral/emotional escalations. 
  Academic supports for students are needed to ensure students follow the rules and behave appropriately in 

class even when the teacher isn't watching. 

  Pedagogues must acquire more instructional strategies to support student's diverse needs to learn 

information.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 17K353, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
Elijah Stroud Middle School 17K353 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities, in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this Parent Involvement 
Policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I Program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title 
I Program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s 
Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Students are assessed utilizing the Reading-Level Indicator and then a deeper analysis is conducted utilizing the DRA. These 
assessments inform instruction by providing accurate information on the students independent reading level as well as the 
instructional reading level. In addition, the ESL instructor uses the DRA to understand students ability of Rhyming, alliteration, 
phonemic awareness  Letter naming, word-list reading, spelling, decoding, analogies, structural analysis, and syllabication. 
After administering the RLI it has been determined that the ELL students tested at least 3 grades below reading level. After 
administering the ELA baseline assessment It was determined that they will need to work on reading comprehension skills 
after analyzing the ELL's results, as all ELL's tested at a two or below. Also student's reading fluency, as well as contextual 
reading, vocabulary, comprehension, and reading engagement skills are also measured in the test. The results of these 
assessments provides data for the ESL teacher to determine the priorities in her instructional practice, and how to effectively 
drive her instruction for optimal student achievement. Based on the assessment results the ESL instructor provides levels 
corresponding to the DRA levels.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
  The success of the entire program is measured by the NYSESLAT scores. NYSESLAT results, state tests scores, and school 
assessments are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the ESL program. In the school year 2013-2014, most of our ESL students 
showed improvement on the NYSESLAT. Some of our students are approaching proficeincy in mastering the NYS Common Core 
standards on the state ELA and Math assessments; and in some case, our ELL students are attaining higher scores than their 
English-speaking classmates.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to question here:    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data results from the students who are assessed by the NYSITELL shows students below level with a need of 360 hours or 
more of  ESL services. NYSESLAT results reveal  students with  1 to 3 years of ESL services show progress in listening and 
speaking, while reading and writing skills are still emerging. These students are assigned individualized work on their reading 
level. Additionally,  students are provided  at-home and school practice to acquire grade appropriate reading and writing skills. 
Students receiving ESL services from 4 to 6 years often achieve proficiency in listening and speaking, while reading and writing 
skills  are approaching proficiency standards. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 ELL students in our school participate in a free standing English as a Second Language (ESL) pull-out program with 
services provided by a licensed ESL teacher. The students are grouped all together, in an ungraded model, with a 
heterogeneous mix. All students receive rigorous instruction in English Language skills as well as in the content areas 
of mathematics, social studies and science as mandated by the CR Part 154 and the Language Allocation Policy. 
Instruction is aligned with ESL and Native Language Arts (NLA) standards, the core curriculum, and CCLS. It is also data 
driven and customized to meet the needs of all ELLs. The workshop model of instruction is used to deliver high 
quality, differentiated instruction for our ELLs. The ESL Program also utilizes software, such as MySciLearn, DuoLingo, 
IReady and Skoolbo, as well as  CD's with pre-recorded text, web-sites for ESL students, computer quizzes and graphic 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

organizers. Students build a foundation of academic language which is enhanced by constant exposure to both new 
and familiar vocabulary.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Paste response to questions here:    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              The mandated instructional minutes are met because the ESL instructor provides the 8 ELL students with pull 
out instruction  first and second period daily which totals up to 450 minutes.  In addition,  the ESL instructor provides push-in 
services for the rest of the day. Students are placed in small flexible groups for targeted instruction based on student needs. 
They are grouped according to proficiency levels as follows: Emerging/entering (4 students); transitioning (1 student); and 
Expanding (3), and all students receive 360 minutes of ESL instruction per week regardless of proficiency levels.  Instruction is 
exclusively given in English and is differentiated based on ability and interests. However, students with the same home 
language are grouped together daily to support each other in small-group instruction. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                 Content area instruction is delivered in English through the use of ESL methodology. Teachers integrate modeling, 
bridging, and contextualization techniques to scaffold instruction for ELL students, utilizing reliable technology translators 
when necessary. Explicit vocabulary instruction supports language acquisition. Students who require home language scaffolds 
for content area, will be given translated work. Graphic organizers and visuals are used as a tool to develop students’ writing 
skills. To accelerate academic achievement we target language development across the grades and content areas, with great 
emphasis on active engagement via interactive experiences. Teachers meet weekly to review students’ progress and plan 
instruction. Specifically, the ESL teacher and content area teachers meet regularly to ensure curriculum alignment. The 
administration provides for common planning sessions to insure that: 1) Teachers provide students with opportunities to be 
involved in purposeful conversations; 
2). All language modalities are incorporated into the lesson - for example group discussions, journals etc.; 3). There is ongoing 
collaboration between content area and ESL teachers to create a learning community knowledgeable about the linguistic 
needs of ELL students; 4).The literacy coach works closely with teachers to support rigorous instruction. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                All ELL students, regardless of proficiency levels, are required to take all content area citywide and state exams. 
Students for whom home language translations are available can take content area exams in their native language. Through 
common planning, updates are provided by the ESL teacher to provide up-to-date support for all ESL students.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. To support Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE), MS 353 will administer a variety of tests in order to 
accurately determine students’ strengths and weaknesses. ELL students are given time and a half during assessments to 
ensure the student has the best opportunity possible. This will guide instruction and the delivery of Academic Intervention 
Services (AIS). We will provide small group instruction that focuses on language acquisition, sight words, and vocabulary 
development to help students become beginning readers, they will use individualized computer programs to develop listening 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

comprehension and basic reading skills. They will also receive additional services in language acquisition via tutoring in our 
extended day and after- school program. Counseling services will be an integral part of this skills building program.  
b.Newcomers, students with less than three years in the US, constitute a small portion of our classes at MS 353. When a new 
student is registered, we provide an informal student orientation, and a buddy system that will assist the student during the 
day. Newcomers receive intensive instruction in basic language skills such as pronunciation, phonics, phonemic awareness and 
vocabulary development. The students are in the classroom with their English-speaking peers and conversation is encouraged 
between all students to enhance English language acquisition. Additionally they receive differentiated instruction from the ESL 
teacher and classroom teachers who have been provided with professional development in "best practices" for ELLS. 
c. The students receiving ESL services from 4 to 6 years perform well in listening and speaking, while reading and writing 
represent a challenge. Thus, they are assigned individualized supplemental work so they can have additional at-home practice 
to accelerate their progress. Further, based on data from the NYSESLAT and comparison of previous year levels on this test, we 
focus on areas of weakness and service these students in our after school program to enhance language acquisition. To build 
their reading fluency, they read books on their proficiency level and use the library books to read at home. To enhance their 
writing skills, the ESL teacher models the writing process and uses graphic organizers to assist students in sequencing and 
organizing their writing projects. 
d. Our plan for long term ELL students will include targeting higher order thinking skills such as inference and analytical skills. 
In addition, our long term ELL students will read specially designed ESL books and the development of the four language skills - 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing – will be emphasized. Long term ELL students will also attend the After-school 
Enrichment Program which focuses on reading comprehension, shared reading, writing activities, as well as mathematics. 
Through day, extended day and after school academicintervention programs, long term ELL students will participate in a broad 
range of activities that promote literacy and mathematic skills. in addition to what we do for new-comers and developing ELLS, 
we implement and utilize a comprehensive literature and language arts program for our Long-term ELLs (LTEs). This academic 
intervention will be utilized in addition to our regular curriculum for our (LTEs) who are at a plateau in their English language 
development and need the additional support with the academic language and literacy skills to tackle challenging fiction and 
nonfiction. We will utilize an abundance of resources to effectively support our students. We will be strategic in utilizing 
supports that let students interact authentically with text, as they mark the text up with their notes, thoughts, opinions and 
reactions to the readings. In addition, we will provide students with a model of fluency through our interactive software and 
ensure that all students have access to the materials arranged by grade level. Lastly, we plan to weave this intervention into 
our established programs for our ELLs (i.e., push-in ESL teacher, team teaching literacy blocks) by carefully considering which 
portions of the students’ academic needs require strengthening, in conjunction with mandating our LTEs to participate in our 
Afterschool/Saturday program provided. 
e. Since all students are expected to meet all performance standards and benchmarks, our instructional program offers all 
students, including our special needs students, day, extended day and after-school instruction in literacy and math each week. 
Teachers in science and social studies differentiate learning for these ELLs by using visuals and manipulatives to illustrate 
concepts, and graphic organizers are used to sequence steps and increase students’ ability to recall information. ELLs with 
special needs have guided instruction that match the students’ IEPs, along with differentiated instruction planned 
collaboratively with the ESL teacher and the Special Education staff. Collaboration between all providers is the focus of our 
plan to enrich instruction and assist students in the classroom.. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
To maximize language development we offer our ELLs students a large selection of resources, including materials such as 
classroom libraries, Side by Side, Shining Star and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT. Oral communication skills are developed 
through the use of Read-Alouds and Shared Reading experiences, and technology is used to enrich the curriculum across the 
content areas. Classroom teachers differentiate instruction to engage students in the 
reading and writing process. Thus,  a language and print rich environment provides support for cognitive language acquisition. 
The curriculum includes stories about families, life in a new country, as well as adjustments to new surroundings. Further, it is 
sensitive to the ethnicity, culture and customs of each student.  If a student requires home language material during new 
language learning, the ELL teacher provides material in home language and translations to bridge learner.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All ELL /SWD are enrolled in our pull-out ESL program and receive mandated ELL services.  The ESL teacher monitors the 
academic progress and language development of those students. The classroom teacher and the ESL teacher determine if the 
child should receive additional AIS services. Further, the after-school tutorial program is also employed as a support for 
children with IEPs.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
For the current school year, we offer a sequence of intervention services that are designed to meet the needs of our students. 
Our ESL teacher and content area teachers provide additional intervention services for targeted students. All content area 
teachers (including ELA, MATH, and science teachers) participate in the AIS program. The AIS program has push-in and pull-out 
components. All content area teachers provide AIS services three times a week. In addition to the AIS program, ELL students 
receive are enrolled in the extended day and after-school programs to get extra support in math, language instruction,  and 
other content areas. All intervention programs are designed for small groups of students. If the ELL student requires home 
language material during AIS the AIS supporter will provide translated material.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the  2015-2016 school year, we redesigned the AIS program (see question 9); added Spanish as a foreign language and 
Spanish club). Our ESL students benefit from getting additional instructional support. There will also be a cultural club that 
students will be able to participate in.  Our ESL teacher will also push-in to core content classrooms for her ELL students to 
ensure support of adequate differentiation and scaffolding. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

For the school year 2015-2016, no service or programs for ELLs will be discontinued. Instead, there will be greater focus on 
differentiation of activities to match the proficiency levels of ELL students. In addition, the common core standards will be 
infused into instructional tasks and two new technology software programs (MySciLearn Starfall DuoLingo) will be used to 
enrich reading and writing skills by providing multiple opportunities for independent practice in all core disciplines. Further, 
each ELL student will have access to a desktop computer that supports guided as well as independent work in reading, writing, 
listening and speaking.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Students are offered ESL content area instruction aligned with NYC and NYS Common Core  Learning standards in ELA, math, 
science and social studies. Besides receiving the mandated ESL services, students receive 90 minutes of ELA instruction daily. In 
addition, our instructional program offers all students, including ELLs, grade and age appropriate day, extended day and after-
school intervention services in literacy and math each week. Their program also includes electives such as art, technology and 
college and career seminar, and community service, foreign language, and clubs.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
To maximize language development we offer our ELLs students a large selection of resources, including materials such as 
classroom libraries, texts such as Side by Side and Shining Star and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT. Oral communication skills 
are developed through the use of read-alouds and shared reading experiences, and technology is used to enrich the curriculum 
across the content areas. Classroom teachers differentiate instruction to engage students in the reading and writing process. 
Thus, a language and print rich environment provides support for cognitive language acquisition. The curriculum includes 
stories about families, life in a new country, as well as adjustments to new surroundings. We utilize native language material if 
necessary by translating and material in the language. We also provide materials connected to the students culture, such as 
books, readings, projects, and writing. Further, it is sensitive to the ethnicity, culture and customs of each student.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

The ESL teacher collaborates with bilingual teachers to determine when support is needed in content areas. Native language 
support is frequently provided by our ELA and social studies teachers in the mainstream classroom. Content area teachers 
provide written instructions and guidelines in students' native language to foster comprehension, academic and language 
development. In addition, ELL students use bilingual dictionaries and glossaries in all content areas.. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

To maximize language development we offer our ELLs students a large selection of resources, including materials such as 
classroom libraries, texts such as Side by Side and Shining Star and Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT. Oral communication skills 
are developed through the use of read-alouds and shared reading experiences, and technology is used to enrich the curriculum 
across the content areas. Classroom teachers differentiate instruction to engage students in the reading and writing process. 
Thus a language and print rich environment provides support for cognitive language acquisition. The curriculum includes 
stories about families, life in a new country, as well as adjustments to new surroundings. Further, it is sensitive to the ethnicity, 
culture and customs of each student.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

necessary by translating and material in the language. We also provide materials connected to the students culture, such as 
books, readings, projects, and writing. Further, it is sensitive to the ethnicity, culture and customs of each student.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Students in transition from elementary to intermediate school participate in an orientation session before entering MS 353. 
Parents are invited to become acquainted with various programs and translation service is provided as applicable. Students 
receive information about the academic and enrichment opportunities available to them. They get a tour given by the ELL 
teacher, or another staff member of the building and meet the staff who will be working with them. Students who are 
transitioning into high school meet with the guidance counselor who assists them in reviewing the high school directory and 
completing the application process.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 Spanish (foreign language instruction); Spanish clubs. All Spanish-speaking students are members of the Spanish club. They 
benefit from the additional language instrucion provided in their native language.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We have developed a process for the staff to meet with the parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. In 
order to ensure this occurs, staff has put in place meetings with parents by semesters, and as well as progress report updates 
for the parents. The ELL teacher communicates with parents in the parents accesible mode, such as letters home, phone calls, 
emails, or conferences. If translation serves are needed they are provided. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

All parents including the parents of ELL students are invited to participate in the PTA and all regular  school workshops. To 
support newly arrived families, the Parent Coordinator does outreach for parents to indicate the areas of need and schedules 
workshops in which they are invited to participate. In addition, they are encouraged to become involved in school celebrations 
and cultural events such as Culture Day,  holiday concerts, curriculum fairs, award ceremonies and talent shows. They are also

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tricia Delauney, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students).

1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

ELL students report that they do not get much help at home as most parents do not read, write or speak English. 
To meet the language translation and interpretation needs of our students and their families. We utilize our 
bilingual school aide and teacher of Spanish to facilitate parent conferences and telephone calls to families 
through use of DOE sites we are able to send home notices in all applicable languages.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

WE will determine within 30 (thirty) days of a student’s enrollment the primary language spoken by the parent of 
each student enrolled in the school, and if such language is not English, whether the parent requires language 
assistance in order to communicate effectively with our school community.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In order to fulfill parental notification requirements we will utilize online tools and resources, as well as staff who may 
speak the language. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?
