Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At P.S. 376 our mission is as follows: 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of Felisa Rincón de Gautier P.S. 376 is to create a 21st century learning environment with high academic 
expectations that foster self-efficacy through students’ unique talents and abilities. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 376 is a School of Technology as well as a Gifted and Talented School. Our school community is a place where 
learning is alive in all classrooms. At P.S. 376, we continuously and successfully apply a Transdisciplinary STEAM 
approach through Project Based Learning (PBL) and instructional technology as an effective teaching and learning 
tools. Educators employ innovative best practices that shift learning from teacher-led instruction to student-
generated inquiry. PBL provides an opportunity for students to deeply investigate a driving question for six to eight 
weeks. During this process, students acquire 21st-century learning skills by collaborating, communicating, thinking 
critically, and being creative. Ultimately, students are able to respond to the driving question autonomously through a 
presentation.  

To share our promising practices, our school was once again, for the fourth consecutive time, selected to be a 
Showcase School for the upcoming 2018-2019 school year. Notably, we were highlighted in New York City’s Best 
Public Elementary Schools: A Parent’s Guide 4th Edition (p. 248-249). 

P.S. 376 embraces the notion that best practices and teacher's expertise provides our students with a premier 
education that resides within our school building. In the 2017-2018 academic school year (Element #1 - Rigorous 
Instruction), we aligned lessons to the Common Core Learning Standards with the goal of engaging our students in the 
development of critical thinking skills and active engagement. As a result, our students made positive gains on the 
2018 NYS ELA and Mathematics Assessments. 

Our school takes pride in being a professional community of lifelong learners. For the 2018-2019 academic school 
year, we collaboratively generated a list of in-house teacher expertise to address Element #3 - Collaborative Teachers 
of the Framework for Great Schools. It will serve as an inventory of effective teaching practices of individual educators 
who exhibit particular strengths in the four Domains from Danielson’s Framework. From this list, teachers will be able 
to request classroom inter-visitations and peer observations in order to exchange ideas, learn new strategies and/or 
learn different teaching methodologies. Furthermore, classroom inter-visitations and peer observations will allow 
participants the opportunity to observe signature and best practices across curricula from trusted colleagues and 
subsequently receive ongoing support to implement these practices. Colleagues engage in collaborative conversations 
in which feedback is provided by host teachers in the form of “glows” and “grows.” 

For the upcoming 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to utilize technology to ensure the success of Project Based 
Learning in all classrooms. In addition, we will continue the practice of engaging students in the Socratic Seminar, 
which we have successfully integrated in grades 2-5. Students engage in rich discussions, as well as classroom debates 
to explore different points of views. By engaging in a Socratic Seminar, students are able to gain critical thinking skills, 
interrogate texts, in order to formulate and support their point of view. Time has been allotted in the instructional 
day to support the development of our students’ discourse in these areas. 

In order to support teacher development and learning, the time has been built into the instructional program to allow 
teachers the opportunity to engage in collaboration through Inquiry Teams and vertical planning sessions. 
Furthermore, to ensure that the writing process is a priority across all classrooms, teachers will work collaboratively 
to modify the Teacher's College Writing Project to meet students’ needs. 

To strengthen teachers practices we will contract outside consultants from Metamorphosis Math and Thinking Maps. 
We will also continue to support teachers by attending Thinking Maps Training of Trainers (TOT), which began in the 
2016-2017 school year, to further the implementation of Thinking Maps in all subject areas in grades K-5. In 
addition,fourModel Teachers will support teachers in best practices.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

In addition to our general Education population, our school services a Gifted and Talented population, English 
Language Learners, and Special Education students. teacher teams will plan lessons together and continue to adjust 
curricula units to ensure lessons meet the needs of these diverse populations by utilizing the practices of Universal 
Design for Learning. Thus, the goal of each lesson is to engage all students in the learning process and allow students 
to take ownership of their own learning. 

To enrich the curriculum for the Gifted and Talented population, teachers compact curriculum using pre and post 
assessment data to meet individual students needs. each class engages in a long-term study aligned to grade level 
curriculum and Common Core Learning Standards (i.e, engineering, coding, entrepreneurship ). 

Our ELL population will be serviced by English as a New Language (ENL) teachers as well as our ENL coordinator, to 
provide academic support in language acquisition. The ENL Coordinator will also be tasked with maintaining 
compliance for each student, testing (e.g.- NYSESLAT, NYSITELL), and maintaining relevant records. Furthermore, the 
ENL Coordinator will support the parents through orientations the will advise parents of ELL students services offered 
in the school. In September 2017, we will offer a Kindergarten Dual Language program in English and Spanish. 

we will continue to service our Special Education students in the least restrictive environment in Self-Contained, 
integrated Co-Teaching classrooms, as well as in the General Education setting. The IEP Coordinator and SETSS 
Teacher will continue to service our mandated students, ensuring implementation of students Individualized 
Education Program (IEP). Additionally, the IEP Coordinator and SETSS Teacher will maintain compliance by scheduling 
students' IEP meetings. The SBST Committee will meet regularly to maintain, update, and discuss educational plans 
for students with special needs and/or students that may need academic intervention. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As part of the Showcase Schools Program, P.S. 376 has worked to develop and share unique learning experiences for 
educators across the city. Over the course of the past 2 years, P.S. 376 has hosted 2,400 educators from all five 
boroughs, which equates to 14,500 hours of professional development. Furthermore, our artifacts and resources, 
used to support the implementation of Project Based Learning, have been downloaded almost 6,00 times from the 
WeTeach website. This supports the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in the areas of teacher 
collaboration, rigorous instruction, supportive environment and effective school leadership. 

Four Key Areas to Focus for this coming school Year:  

Rigorous Instruction, Teacher Collaboration, Effective School Leadership, and Supportive Environment:  

We will continue to design an effective professional development plan. The research that will support this work is 
Instructional Rounds, by Richard Elmore. Elmore (2002),we have identified the three domains that are grounded on 
effective teaching practices, the first domain is, “deep knowledge of subject matters and skills,” the second domain is, 
“expertise in instructional practices,” and the third domain is “pedagogical content knowledge”. Our professional 
development team will include these three domains as the guiding instructional principles. These learning shifts will 
be differentiated by the “different levels of teacher expertise" in the school building. Furthermore, we will assess 
what “students need to know and be able to do” through our data articulation cycles. The overall arching goal is to 
apply the new knowledge and to transfer the skills into the classroom with the return of building human capital. 
These effective practices are critical elements, and we have a clear understanding of the importance of these domains 
to support our teachers.

The Administrative Cabinet, members of the Instructional Cabinet, School Leadership members and teacher teams 
analyzed the June 2018 Instructional Report. Subsequently, based on the data findings. School Leaders decided to 
focus on explanatory writing, close reading with a focus on determining main idea and central message. For Math, 
the data indicates a need to increase use of math investigations in order to improve student performance on multi-
step word problems. 

 
  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Writing: 

By June 2019 100% of the students will experience explanatory writing.  

An on-demand explanatory writing assessment will be administered at the beginning of the first genre unit of 
explanatory writing, and at the end of the second genre unit of explanatory writing. This should demonstrate an 
increase of at least one proficiency scaled score level, as evidenced by 2 or 4 point New York State rubric as well as the 
Writing from Beginning and Beyond Explanatory rubric. 

 

Mathematics:  

By June 2019, 75% of the students that were below or approaching the previous year’s grade level benchmarks will 
improve at least one benchmark level. School Administrators, members of the Instructional Cabinet, and the Curriculum 
Committee will analyze school wide performance results and math item-skills analysis in conjunction with school-based 
student data to identify patterns, trends and/or gaps in student achievement to promote a comprehensive successful 
plan.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
As reported on the Framework for Great Schools Report 2017, based on the NYC School Survey results, our school 
received an overall score of 4.11 out of 4.99 pertaining to respondents views on whether our school creates a culture 
that encourages students to support one another and provides for their social and emotional growth.  

Our school's strength is in the area of "Safety" (97%), whereas the area in need of improvement is "Social Emotional" 
(96%). Thus, we have identified a need to improve respondents views about how effectively and successfully we 
create a supportive learning environment for all students.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Supportive Environment-As reported on the Framework for Great Schools Report 2017, based on the NYC School 
Survey results, our school received an overall score of 4.11 out of 4.99 pertaining to respondents’ views on whether 
our school creates a culture that encourages students to support one another and provides for their social and 
emotional growth. Our school's strength is in the area of "Safety" (97%), whereas the area in need of improvement is 
"Social Emotional" (96%). Thus, we have identified a need to improve respondents’ views about how effectively and 
successfully we create a supportive learning environment for all students. By June 2019, the framework score for 
"Supportive Environment" will reflect an increase from 4.11 to 4.16.

As reported on the 2015-2016 NYC School Survey, Framework for Great Schools, our school received an overall score 
of 4.80 out of 4.99 pertaining to school practices and conditions that drive student achievement.  

Thus, we've identified a need to improve respondents views about how we effectively and successfully foster a 
commitment to student success, school improvement, and continuous professional learning within a culture of 
respect through teacher collaboration.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 376, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 376 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

●providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level,  

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

 

●providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and  

decision making in support of the education of their children; 

 

●fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and

monitor their child’s progress; 

 

●providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

●sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and  

in languages that parents can understand; 

 

●providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve  

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and  

other members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the  

school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the  

implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated  

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

 

●support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the  

Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing  

technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

 

●maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and  

families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the  

assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school  

environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events  

and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 

 

●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 

accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and  

support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

●provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State  

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality  

Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

 

●host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise  

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to  

be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and  

other applicable sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

 

●schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49

Begin description here:            
  Rationale: 
 
The Title III program at P.S. 376 serves to enhance and clarify the daily instruction that English 
Language Learners (ELLs) receive during the regular school day. Teachers use the Project Based 
Learning (PBL) approach to deliver instruction. Learning is centered around student-driven 
projects done collaboratively in a setting that reproduces real world dynamics. Project Based 
Learning helps students make academic and linguistic connections. Language acquisition, then 
increases, because students are learning new vocabulary and other language skills in a 21st 
century learning environment. It also allows students to be engaged in all four modalities of 
language while being immersed in an environment where they become problem solvers and find 
solutions to different challenges. While conducting research and developing their projects, many 
opportunities are provided to build: listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. PBL allows 
teachers to target Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) along with the New Language Arts 
Progressions, and language objectives into instruction; students gain content and language 
knowledge in a real world setting. 
During Title III instruction, the students will have opportunities to use technology to support and 
assist with the acquisition of critical academic language and content vocabulary. Following the 
school's focus on creating 21st century learners, students will continue to learn how to use 
software and online resources such as: Microsoft Word, Power Point, Prezi, iMovie, Frames 
(Claymation), coding(robotics), Stop Motion, and Pages to enhance their PBL presentations. 
Students will have additional time to engage in collaborative conversations and to practice the 
English language while working with their peers on their projects.  Our Title III program 
therefore allows for educational growth in engaging ways through the use of the PBL and 
technology.  The Project Based Learning approach will give children the chance to share their 
projects and showcase what they have learned using different modalities; they will present both 
to their Title III classmates and to the extended school community at the annual Early Childhood 
Technology Expo and the Annual STEAM Expo. 
 
Additional Title III ELL Programs: 
Record-Keeping: 
A binder will be organized and maintained by the Title III After-School Program Coordinator. 
This binder will include the program overview, program calendar, parent notification letters, 
student permission slips and student attendance records. All parent notifications will be provided 
in English and the parent's preferred language as  stated in the Home Language 
Identification Survey.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The school will run an After-School Academy during the school year for ELL students. The 
program will start in December and will include 2nd-5th grade students. During the After-School 
Program classes will run from 2:20- 4:00pm from December 5, 2018 through May 1, 2019. 
There will be a total of 35 sessions. The total amount of personnel will be 3 teachers. 
 
Subgroups: 
The targeted population will include students in grades 2-5. Students in grades 3-5 face the 
demands of standardized testing, and as such, we want to support our ELLs and help them 
prepare by fostering their language development. Second grade students will also be targeted. 
Many of the students are current ELLs. We will include former ELLs in the program in order to 
provide additional transitional support. The program will serve all levels of ELLs from Entering 
to Expanding, and as already mentioned, some who are recently Commanding as well. The 
classes will be composed of 10-15 students. 
 
Instruction: 
The language of instruction will be English. However when needed, native language support will 
be provided. Materials that provide native language support will be available so that students 
build the habit of utilizing their native language to help them bridge their English learning. 
Teachers will follow the PBL protocol established in our school to plan and deliver instruction. 
 
Types of Materials: 
Students will use books on the chosen topic of study to supplement their instruction. They will 
also use content area glossaries. Students will also use computers to access online resources that 
will aid them in their research. They will use software and online resources such as PowerPoint, 
Prezi, and Pages to create their projects. Students will use technology during the Title III 
programs as part of the instruction towards their projects.  As part of our curriculum practice, 
students will engage regularly in classroom discussions using the Socratic Model. In addition, 
various arts modalities will be integrated to supplement and enhance their final 
projects.

Begin description here:            
Rationale: 
According to the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education, all teachers servicing ELL 
students are required to receive professional development that specifically addresses the needs of 
English language learners. All professionals involved in the academic development of ELLs 
should understand their role as teachers of language learners. It is vital educators recognize the 
characteristics of the ELL population (culture, learning styles, levels of acquisition, and the 
process of learning a new language), the Federal and state mandates regarding this population, 
and the resources and strategies available to help teachers help  ELLs meet benchmarks and 
improve language acquisition.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Begin description here:            
Rationale: 
 
Parents of ELLs play a vital part in their children's success in school.  Therefore, creating a 
strong partnership will ensure their children's educational growth towards achieving success in 
school.  In doing so we will pay special attention to the anxiety that parents of ELLs experience 
when they are invited to workshops at our school. It is for this reason we will take special care in 
designing workshops that will make them feel comfortable and welcomed. It is our goal to 
empower parents of ELLs to feel confident about themselves and towards helping their children 
achieve in school.  In addition, our school is focused on current research and data that support 
best practices in promoting the educational welfare of ELLs in our school. 
 
Schedule and Duration of Parental Activities: 
 
Monthly parental/guardian meetings will be held the first Tuesday of the month during the 
evening. The first and second grade Dual Language teachers will meet with parents of ELLs to 
inform them of the monthly units of study and share resources. These meetings will also include 
tips and strategies that parents of ELL students can use to support their children's education. 
Additionally, specific workshops will be made available to support the content areas and 
strategies children are learning at school. At this meeting materials will be given to parents in 
their native language.  This initiative will help parents communicate the content knowledge to 
their children. This approach will provide parents with ways to be invested in their children's 
educational growth and  therefore building their confidence as well as the students'.  The parental 
engagement schedule is as follow:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At P.S. 376, teachers utilize multiple formative assessments to plan and deliver effective instruction for the ELLs.  Some of the 
assessments teachers use to guide and plan for instruction are as follows: 
          *Reading 
                    o             TCRWP 
                    o             ELA NY Ready CCLS Aligned Baseline Assessment 
                    o             Dibels 
                    o             Gates- MacGinites 
                    o             ELA Teacher generated bi-weekly assessment 
          * Writing

                    o             On-Demand Narrative Writing 
                    o             On-Demand Informational Writing

                    o             Bi-weekly Investigations and Tasks 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teacher teams have common planning preparatory periods at least once week to plan next steps based on the data collected 
during assessment. The teams first monitor student understanding and level of mastery and then discuss possible next steps. 
Every Monday during Professional Development, Vertical Teacher Teams engage in Cycles of Collaborative Inquiry that review 
student work and data to guide instruction for specific groups of students including ELL students. Additionally, ENL teachers 
meet once a week during a common prep to disccuss specific strategies to support ELL students. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
          *Reading 
                    o             TCRWP 
                    o             ELA NY Ready CCLS Aligned Post Assessment 
                    o             Dibels 
                    o             Gates- MacGinites 
                
          * Writing 
                    o             Post On-Demand Narrative Writing 
                    o             Post On-Demand Informational Writing 
                    o             Post On-Demand Opinion Writing 
 
           *Mathematics 
                    o              Math NY Ready CCLS Aligned Post Assessment 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered and analyzed, the teacher teams use inquiry cycles to focus and guide instruction 
and provide RTI services in the classroom where necessary. This guides small grouping in the classroom using strategies, such 
as Guided Reading, to drive classroom instruction. Also push in/ pull out services are provided by the ENL Coordinator as 
indicated in the data and mandated ENL services. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Strong Tier 1 instruction aligned to the CCLS is at the heart of all instruction ELL's receive. Teachers engage in purposeful 
professional development to support language and literacy development. The administrative cabinet closely monitors data 
from each teacher’s class and advises appropriately. Teachers administer bi-weekly assessments and gather and analyze data 
in order to design small group instruction that targets the needs of ELL's. Teachers in each grade meet weekly during a 
common planning period to discuss the various strategies that will be implemented to improve student performance. ELLs' 
performance is compared to that of their peers in each grade and interventions are designed accordingly. Teachers use 
multiple sources of information to design instruction. Learning styles, home characteristics, and classroom practices are some 
of the parameters that are analyzed through a language acquisition lens in order to design supplemental interventions.  Some 
examples of these interventions may include: cultural and linguistic considerations, connecting learning experiences to 
students' background knowledge, scaffolded students tasks aligned to ELLs' proficiency levels, and allowing ELLs to complete 
tasks in their native languages. 
 
Oral language development has been linked to academic achievement in English. For this reason, ample opportunities are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

provided for ELLs to study and practice vocabulary. Teachers build background knowledge by previewing key concepts and 
content-specific vocabulary.  The use of Socratic Seminar promotes collaborative discussions and the opportunity to utilize 
vocabulary learned during instruction. Reader's theater provides a vehicle to practice oral performance and develop fluency. In 
addition, ENL teachers include language frames and sentence stems as guides for students participating in classroom 
discussions who need extra support. 
 
Writing language skills are particularly challenging for English Language Learners. Our school uses the writing workshop model 
in conjunction with Thinking Maps to guide and help students plan and organize their thinking before writing. Thinking Maps 
are particularly useful for ELLs because they provide a concrete way to support students throughout the writing process. 
Teachers work with students to help select and create the specific Thinking Maps to plan, draft, and revise the student's 
writing tasks. Rubrics, checklists and writng protocols also support and guide students during their writing assignments. ELLs 
are also encouraged to visualize and orally share their thinking before writing.     
 
Word Study is very important to the development of language. In K-2 ENL classes, phonemic awareness and phonics 
instruction play important roles in language development. Teachers use Fundations along with songs, poems and word games 
to promote students' phonemic awareness. Spelling patterns, letter combinations, and sight words are taught with familiar 
texts and are visible in the classrooms' word walls. Students are also provided with personal lists of words to use for reference 
in their personal toolkits. 
 
Lastly, teachers use baseline and bi-weekly assessments to modify reading tasks for ELL's. Reading tasks are scaffolded to 
promote and increase reading comprehension. Vocabulary and content knowledge is frontloaded in the lesson (transition 
words, academic vocabulary, and tier III words).  Reading tasks are modified to target specific skills and learning strategies; 
texts are analyzed and modified to ensure appropriateness to students' needs and levels.   
 
If students who need more targeted intervention outside of the classroom are identified, the ENL coordinator, 
the IEP coordinator and the administrative staff, work collaboratively to assess previous efforts and determine next steps for 
struggling ELLs. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The evaluation of New York State ELA and Math Assesments, plus the NYSESLAT results guide the design of ELL programs at 
P.S. 376. 
 
In Kindergarten, NYSITELL proficiency levels are used initially to identify student subgroups, which are used to support small 
group instruction in the classroom. In 1st and 2nd grade, NYSESLAT proficiency levels are used to determine ENL services and 
to inform the design of after-school programs. In grades 3-5, data is interpreted differently. NYSESLAT results for each ELL 
student are analyzed and compared to ELA data. With the support of the ELL Data Analysis Tool, trends for specific ELL 
subgroups are identified. Teachers, administrators and other service providers then use this information to identify best 
practices to better serve and address the needs of specific subgroups. This information is also used while planning 
extracurricular and enrichment activities that target the school's ELL population. 
 
   
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 During Inquiry, Data Articulation, teacher team and schoolwide faculty meetings, the administrative staff at P.S. 376 shares 
student assessment outcomes with the rest of the school personnel. The data is closely analyzed to identify trends and areas 
of need. Also, teacher teams have weekly common planning preps where they continue to analyze data collected during 
regular benchmark and teacher generated assessments. The teams monitor student understanding, level of mastery, and 
discuss possible next steps. Every Monday during Professional Development, Vertical Teacher Teams engage in Cycles of 
Collaborative Inquiry that review student work and data to guide instruction for specific groups of students including ELL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

students. Additionally, ENL teachers meet once a week during a common prep to discuss specific strategies to support 
students. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 
P.S. 376 Freestanding ENL Program is implemented in two different ways. Grades 1-2 ELLs and former ELLs 
(Commanding students) are kept together in one class for each grade. The classroom teacher, a certified ENL/bilingual 
teacher, delivers all ENL services mandated for the students in her class. The instruction is in English with resources 
and supports provided in the student's home language. Integrated ENL instruction is delivered through Reading and 
Writing Workshops, as well as through PBL activities. Teachers in these classrooms group students with mandated 
standalone ENL as well as any students that have been identified during assessments as needing the extra support. 
Standalone instruction is delivered in a small group setting. These classes are heterogeneous and include students 
with different proficiency levels. The teachers in these classrooms work with their grade teams to plan CCLS aligned 
lessons for the entire grade that are rigorous and engaging. Teachers then use the New Language Progressions to 
modify the lessons to provide appropriate scaffolds that are based on student data. 
 
In Grades 3-5 students are distributed among the general ed classes. An ENL certified teacher is responsible for the 
delivery of all ENL instruction. This teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to plan and deliver instruction. In 
these classrooms, ELL students with different proficiency levels are heterogeneously grouped. Integrated ENL minutes 
are delivered through different content areas. Reading workshop, writing workshop, mathematics, and PBL are all 
platforms used to plan scaffolds and address students' needs. Required standalone ENL minutes are delivered in 
homogeneous groups across two grades, 3-4 or 4-5. Groups with a maximum of 6 students receive 
mandated  services. During weekly meetings, teachers analyze student progress and decide how to best target 
students' needs. In this way ENL services are tailored to our ELLs.           Students who are SIFE receive all interventions 
the school can offer including working with classroom teachers and using computer programs that can help them 
acquire foundational skills. Since the school is cognizant that language and content learning are interdependent, all 
ENL teachers are required to plan each lesson according to the New Language Progressions. Saturday School ENL 
classes and After School ENL classes are offered so that ELLs can have more time to engage in content area tasks.Each 
class has a word wall that shows high frequency words and also has separate content word walls to reflect the 
academic language that is being acquired. Students also have resources such as content picture dictionaries that 
organize language around themes and help the students to access the less frequently used content words. All 
classrooms are literacy rich environments with a variety of grade level and age appropriate texts for students. 
ELLs have equal access to the core curriculum and CCLS aligned instruction in their classes. There are differentiated 
instructional strategies used in order to support ELLs' social, emotional, and academic needs. Flexible grouping allows 
for ELL students to be placed in small groups that deliver needs-based instruction, centered around the development 
of academic language. Materials in ENL classrooms support quality education for students. Teachers design 
differentiated tasks using multiple entry points for their group work in order to target the specific language and 
academic needs ELLs have.

P.S. 376 will start a Dual Language Program in 2017-2018 with a kindergarten self-contained class. The Dual Language 
Enrichment Program is a language program designed to develop literacy in both English and Spanish. The program 
follows a 50-50 model where half the instruction is in English and the other half is in Spanish. The program is 
composed of English proficient students and English Language Learner students. Heterogeneous grouping provides 
the perfect setting to allow students to learn from each other. Literacy instruction in both languages will occur 
simultaneously. Spanish instruction will take place through the Reading and Writing Workshops. Mathematics 
instruction will be delivered in English. In addition, students will receive a period of English foundational skills and 
English instruction through Project Based Learning.  
 
The classroom teacher, a certified ENL/bilingual teacher, delivers all ENL services mandated for the students in her 
class. Integrated ENL instruction is delivered through PBL instruction. The classroom teacher groups students with 
mandated standalone ENL services as well as those identified during assessments as needing the extra support. 
Standalone instruction is delivered in a small group setting. The class is heterogeneous and include students with 
different proficiency levels. The teacher works with her grade team to plan CCLS aligned lessons for the entire grade 
that are rigorous and engaging. She then uses the New Language Progressions to modify the lessons to provide 
appropriate scaffolds that are based on student data and that support academic language development. 
  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            Explicit ENL and ELA minutes are delivered by the classroom teachers in all self-contained ENL classes.  All teachers in 
this program model are certified ESL/bilingual teachers. During the literacy block teachers provide mandated ENL time using a 
Balanced Literacy approach. Since students in Grades K-3 spend their day with a certified ESL teacher, they consistently receive 
more than the mandated services. Teachers include content and language objectives. Strategic attention to developing 
language structure, academic vocabulary, and grade level content knowledge is one way best practices are implemented 
during quality ENL instruction. In addition to specific ENL time during the Literacy Block, the students are instructed across the 
content areas utilizing the same approaches. The school utilizes a PBL approach that integrates content knowledge, reading, 
writing, and technology education. Additionally, students who are Entering and Emerging spend some of their additional ENL 
time on computer programs such as Rosetta Stone or websites that help foster basic understanding of the structures of 
English.  The students in Grades 4 and 5 who get their ENL services from a Push In Teacher receive some of their instruction 
during the designated ELA time for the whole class. Having the ENL teachers push in during the Literacy block works well 
because it provides the ENL instruction in conjunction with the ELA time in the class. The ENL students in Grades 4 and 5 work 
in small groups within their classrooms on the same content as the students who are not ELLs. The literacy instruction 
incorporates appropriate scaffolds for ELLs in order to make the content comprehensible to them. Entering and Emerging ELLs 
receive 360 minutes of ENL time a week, while students who are Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes of 
instruction. Students at the Commanding level receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction for two extra years. Entering and 
emergent students are scheduled for additional ENL time outside of their classroom to receive Standalone ENL mandated 
minutes. Students are provided with a space that makes them more comfortable to speak the target language because they 
are working with students in a very small group who all have the same language experience. All instruction is CCLS aligned, just 
as the classroom instruction is, and has a great focus on the Speaking and Listening strand and the Language standards. This 
type of focused instruction, which revolves specifically around those two standards, really sets the Entering and Emerging ELL 
students up for success by providing the students with a language foundation that they can take back into their own 
classrooms.      
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 
One measure used to evaluate students in their native language is the Spanish LAB test. This test is given when the students 
are newly entitled to services as a basis for comparison of the score on the NYSITELL and the score on the Spanish LAB. 
Students who are Spanish dominant can take their math assessments in Spanish. This is an evaluation tool that is used to check 
their math progress. The school has Go Math books in Spanish for each grade. For ELA instruction, there are Spanish copies of 
some of the books that are part of the core curriculum. Students can work with books in Spanish to complete the tasks for 
their lessons. Classroom library books that supplement the units of studies for each subject are also available. The student's 
native language is used to support and enhance the student's learning.  
All standardized content area tests (science and math) are available for ELLs in their native language. For languages to which 
there are no translations (Arabic), translators are hired to ensure the students are appropriately evaluated.  The students take 
the practice tests with all of the ELL modifications to ensure that they are comfortable utilizing the side by side English and 
native language exams. In addition, students are provided with bilingual glossaries in their native language. 
Students are allowed to write in their native language. There are many pedagogues that are fluent in Spanish (or translators) 
so they are able to check for accuracy and understanding of the given task.  
    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
 
 
a. Instruction for SIFE students provides them with opportunities to fill in their learning gaps. SIFE students participate in the 
schoolwide Fundations block which focuses on the phonics and phonemic awareness development that is the precursor to 
reading in English. There are designated classrooms to host the students during Fundations. The teachers are certified ENL 
teachers or certified Special Education teachers. Students are also set up with computer programs such as Starfall and Rosetta 
Stone that can give students more foundational skills. The school has classroom libraries that are appropriate for SIFE 
students. The books are high interest but low level with topics that match the CCLS aligned grade level content. Additionally 
there are some ENL programs that have books, books with CDS, CD roms / technology, songs, phonics and word study 
components that integrate all the skills SIFE students need. A certified ENL Teacher works in very small groups or one to one 
with each SIFE student.  b. Newcomers are identified for targeted ENL instruction. They receive a minimum of 360 minutes of 
ENL instruction by a certified ENL teacher. They work in very small groups that target the instruction they need. Instruction is 
scaffolded so that they are participating in grade level CCLS aligned work, with the use of the Home Language Progressions as 
guideline. Teachers focus on building academic vocabulary and making sure the students feel comfortable and motivated to 
use English. Newcomers also use the Rosetta Stone program to assist with English language acquisition. They are invited to 
attend After School and Saturday School supplementary instructional programs. This gives them more time to engage in the 
target language. The students are provided with resources that aid with language acquisition and make content 
comprehensible such as bilingual picture dictionaries and word wall vocabulary cards.  c. NYSELAT data points to the need of 
Developing ELLs for intensive instruction in reading and writing. The ENL teacher pushes in during Reading and Writing (the 
Literacy Block) in order to deliver small group instruction that specifically targets their needs. Word study, Guided Reading, 
and bridging the oral ability to the reading and writing, will be the focus of the instructional time. The students' scores on the 
NYSESLAT, ELA and TCRWP assessments will be analyzed and cross referenced to identify the students' needs and target areas 
of needs. Students will also be encouraged to participate in After School and Saturday School programs. d. Long Term ELLs will 
be closely monitored by the classroom teacher and the ENL Teacher. The NYSESLAT, ELA, Math, and Science standardized tests 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

will be analyzed by the school staff to formulate an appropriate educational plan for the Long Term ELLs. Data from these 
assessments will drive instruction in class, AIS groups, and at the After School and Saturday School programs so that learning 
can be aligned. Students will be mandated to attend the After School and Saturday School programs. They will receive targeted 
small group instruction which will focus on academic language development across the curriculum. Explicit language 
instruction will target comprehension, vocabulary development, and grammatical structures. Specific language objectives will 
guide activities that will aim to integrate content based activities with reading and writing. e. Instruction for Former ELLs aims 
to prepare students to succeed academically without the scaffolds designed to assist ELLs. K-2 former ELLs remain in the ENL 
class as they transition. Commanding students in 3-5 continue to receive their mandated minutes of services by an ENL 
teacher. In order to help commanding students' success independently, teachers continue to plan and design instruction based 
on the data available for these students and the use of the Language Progressions. Strong focus is placed on helping the 
former ELLs meet the demands of academic language. Teachers plan lessons aimed at expanding vocabulary (especially tier 3 
words) and addressing syntax and language functions that might still be challenging for the students. Visual support, word 
walls, personal word lists, thinking maps, and hands-on activities are some of the tools for the students. For students needing 
reading fluency, reader's theater activities are used to help increase fluency.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 
Teachers of students with ELLs with disabilities use the individual needs of their students to plan specially designed instruction. 
Teachers use the new language progressions, students’ IEPs, and data collected from weekly and bi-weekly assessments to 
modify the lessons for their students’ needs. Instruction is delivered using the principals of Universal Design for Learning in 
order to make the grade level content accessible to the diverse needs of their students. Such instruction includes the use of 
multiple modalities, multi-sensory activities, small group strategy lessons, and explicit modeling in order for students to 
acquire the academic language needed to meet the demands of the Common Core State Standards. Additionally, teachers of 
ELL-SWDs utilize technology across all content areas to engage, differentiate, and increase their students ability to access the 
general education curriculum with independence. One way teachers provide access to academic content while promoting 
language acquisition is by engaging students in Project based learning. Through PBL,  ELL-SWDs have opportunities to practice 
their creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking skills.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 
 
Special education teachers, general education teachers, EnL teachers, related service providers, and  administrators, meet 
reguarly as the School Implementation Team to review IEPs to determine how to deliver instruction to individual students in 
the Least Restrictive Environment. This includes the consideration of flexible programming on a case by case basis. 
 
All teachers, including those teachers of ELL SWDs utilize Thinking Maps to scaffold material across all subject areas. This 
instructional tool supports ELL SWDs to access the demands of the Common Core State Standards and  achieve their academic 
goals. For instance, Thinking Maps are used before, during, and after reading instruction to support students in  organizing key 
details about texts they’ve read. Additonally, during writing instruction, Thinking Maps are used as a planning tool to support 
ELL SWDs that have writing goals about improved organization as well as improved elaboration. Teachers also use visuals and 
small group instruction to support students to attain English proficiency within the Least Restrictive Environment. 
    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 
 
Intervention programs for ELLs target all ELL subgroups and focus on the students in Grades 3-5 and a handful of students in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

Grades K- 2. The school offers additional interventions for ELLs and follows the RtI framework. Classroom teachers identify and 
work with struggling students. Staff development workshops related to this area aid the teachers in their delivery of the 
content in ways that are helpful for struggling students. The school also incorporates technology interventions for students. 
Students who need additional assistance in phonics and decoding use websites such as Starfall.com to help with seeing and 
hearing the sounds of the English alphabet and language. Fundations is also used to help with targeted phonics and phonemic 
awareness. Additionally, the school uses Rosetta Stone English to assist students who need more targeted time on acquiring 
the specific aspects of English that Rosetta Stone programs offer. The Math Coach works with students who are having 
difficulty in Math. He pushes in and provides small group support to the students and presents content using models, visuals, 
and in other manners found to be effective with ELLs. Instruction is in English but attention is paid to cognates and the 
students have bilingual picture dictionaries for language support as well. Supplemental materials that are recommended for 
intervention from the Go Math series are the materials that are utilized. In addition, there is a heavy focus on using 
manipulatives. The school also uses Inquiry Team time, which is weekly by grade and then combined for the ENL Inquiry, to 
look at the data and see what instructional shifts need to be made so students can progress. Teachers target skills to address 
where students are showing weakness and work together on appropriate interventions that they can incorporate into their 
teaching. Additional interventions the school offers are in different tiers in the RtI model. The Speech Teacher works with 
students who could benefit with help processing and expressing target language. The ENL Coordinator works with students in 
small groups. The struggling readers get Guided Reading four times a week and word work that is integrated to fit with the 
language within the Guided Reading books. Materials from A to Z Reading, Award Reading, Wright Group, Rigby, and Amazing 
English, in addition to some books that have specific practice in reading comprehension skills such as finding the main idea and 
identifying the theme. P.S. 376 strongly believes that ELLs can and will achieve if instruction is delivered in ELL friendly ways 
and in an engaging manner. The staff work together to analyze data, identify ELLs in need and to deliver intervention services 
so all ELLs can succeed.  When the school receives a new ELL student who knows no English, the student is set up computer 
programs that can target basic English acquisition. Additionally, the student is able to utilize the Listening Center to follow 
along while reading English books. The student is also a candidate for Rosetta Stone. If the child seems to be a SIFE student, 
arrangements are made to help the students acquire basic skills that they lack through the use of all avail The school is heavily 
focusing on improving writing for ELLs. There is an initial focus on oral language that then carries over into improvement in 
student writing. All students at varying levels are taught to define and support an opinion using text evidence in a variety of 
ways. There will be a heavy focus on professional development. The school will use in-house personnel such as the SETTS 
Teacher and the ENL Coordinator, and outside personnel such as the Literacy Consultant and the Socratic Seminar Facilitator to 
help students acquire higher skills. In addition to focused staff development, teachers will be sent to workshops that will help 
to support teaching our struggling learners to be armed with more strategies. Additionally, the school will be using cluster 
teachers to help provide RtI to some classes. We are trying to make a variety of personnel available to support our students.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

P.S. 376 will start a Dual Language Program in 2017-2018 with a kindergarten self-contained class. The Dual Language 
Enrichment Program is a language program designed to develop literacy in both English and Spanish. This program will serve 
both English Proficient students and English Language Learners. The Program will expand to first grade on 2018-2019. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs at P.S. 376. All classrooms are equipped with the latest computer 
technology, Smartboards and document cameras. ELL classrooms also receive brand new computers and Smart tables in order 
to enhance listening and technology centers. Students also participate in all assembly programs and regular day programming. 
ELLs are invited to participate in after school enrichment programs that include dance, technology, and journalism.  
Additionally, the school offers specific programs that target the ELL population. Title III After School and Saturday School 
Programs, are specifically created  for ELLs. The CASA Program connects ELL students with visiting artists. Every effort is made 
to give the students ample opportunities to practice and increase language. They are encouraged to apply for all special school 
programs such as the Robotics Club. Additionally, they are considered for all school productions (dance, music, band) and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

extra-curricular activities that school offers. They also participate in the Ballroom Dance Competition. ELLs are of the highest 
priority at P.S. 376 and will continue to be included in all programs we offer.  
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Classes are scheduled for instructional technology several times a week. Instruction in the technology lab correlates with grade 
level CCLS aligned classroom work. In addition to supporting grade aligned content istruction, students learn coding and 
robotics. The school has a Portaportal.com page which includes technology specific links and additional websites that support 
classroom instruction. The site allows all teachers to access materials and resources to enhance classroom instruction. Each 
classroom teacher creates a website that includes homework, students' projects and useful links to support students at 
home.  All classrooms are equipped with Smartboards and document cameras that. These tools enhance instruction by making 
learning more interesting and by providing visual support. Other technology support for ELLs includes Brain Pop Junior, 
Pictures Match, Starfall Reading Games, Discovery Education videos, English Club Games, ESL Games World, Nat Geo Games, 
Scholastic News, Time for Kids and Rossetta Stone. Reading A-Z has capabilities in Spanish which are useful for bridging the 
knowledge students have in their native language with the new content they are learning in English. Additionally, teachers 
bring in realia, videos, and multiple data sources (magazines, encyclopedias, intervention resources, high interest lower level 
reading materials) to provide ELLs with a variety of resources they can use to access information. All ENL classrooms are also 
equipped with listening centers and computer centers. The combined materials result in the enhancement of learning for ELLs 
and will continue to be expanded as they become available.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

P.S. 376 recognizes the importance of incorporating native language into instruction for ELLs. Students receive native language 
support through a number of resources. Bilingual (Spanish / English) picture dictionaries, native language literature in the 
classroom library, and books on tapes and CDs in the native language for use in listening centers are all made available to the 
ENL students. Additionally, teachers have bilingual content glossaries (Science, Social Studies, and Math) that are utilized in the 
upper grades. Teachers also instruct students on cognates where applicable and capture their teaching with Cognates Word 
Walls. Many teachers speak the students' native languages and incorporate them when it is necessary and useful for the 
students. Students are also allowed to speak in their native languages when they are working on completing classroom tasks. 
The use of native language as a bridge between new learning and prior learning is welcome and valued in the ENL classroom.   
In the Dual Language Enrichment program, students will receive instruction in Spanish through the Reading and Writing 
Workshops. There will be a period dedicated to Spanish Foundational Skills. The Dual Language teacher will use El Sistema de 
Evaluacion de Lectura (SEL) by Fountas and Pinnell to determine instructional and independent reading levels. She will be able 
to observe students' reading behaviors to track students' Spanish reading levels and plan instruction.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The resources correspond to the students' ages and grade levels because the content of the resources is based on the grade 
level CCLS aligned curriculum. The materials are aligned with the CCLS ELA and Math standards and also with the New York 
State Science and Social Studies Standards. Books in classroom libraries are high interest books in their design and content, yet 
the content is at reading levels that are appropriate for allowing ELLs to access the language (high interest, lower reading level 
texts). All classrooms have a variety of highly supportive technology-based and non-technology based materials on the topics 
that are part of the curriculum in the class and that are of interest to students in that particular age group. The Listening 
Center Resources also match the curriculum content and allow ELLs to access grade and age appropriate level information 
without having to worry about decoding words as much as if they were reading independently. Additionally, they add to 
students' acquisition of English fluency. The visual nature of computer websites and videos enhance understanding in 
motivating and interesting ways and match the content of the curriculum. The school values the use of resources to deliver 
content in ways that are appropriate and comprehensible for ELLs. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The families of newly enrolled ELL students have the opportunity to meet with the principal, assistant principal and ENL 
Coordinator during enrollment. If the preliminary information on file at the school shows that a language other than English is 
spoken in the home, the ENL Coordinator schedules individual appointments with parents to visit the school and look at some 
of the ELL programming. Additionally, at orientation in June, parents of potential ELLs are given additional time outside of the 
regularly scheduled meetings in order to get oriented with ELL programs offered in New York City and to allow for any 
additional questions and answers parents may have about ELL status and what that means for the education of their children. 
The school offers a Back to School Day during a Saturday in September. Community Based Organizations are present at this 
event, as well as school personnel. The event offers information in the parents' native languages about the support services 
offered to new immigrants.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Since this is an elementary school, the program for all students, including ELLs, does not include electives.  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

The Dual Language Enrichment Program at P.S. 376 is a language program designed to develop literacy in 
both English and Spanish. The program follows a 50-50 model where half the instruction is in English and 
the other half is in Spanish. Heterogeneous grouping provides the perfect setting to allow students to 
learn from each other.  
The Dual Language Enrichment Program is composed of English Language Learners and English Proficient 
students. Literacy instruction in both languages will occur simultaneously. Spanish instruction will take 
place through the Reading and Writing Workshops. Mathematics instruction will be delivered in English. 
In addition, students will receive English instruction through Project Based Learning. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
According to the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education, all teachers servicing ELL students are required to receive 
professional development that specifically addresses the needs of English language learners. All professionals involved in the 
academic development of ELLs should understand their role as teachers of language learners. It is vital that educators 
recognize the characteristics of the ELL population (culture, learning styles, levels of acquisition, and the process of learning a 
new language), the Federal and state mandates regarding this population and the resources and strategies available to help 
teachers help ELLs meet benchmarks and improve language acquisition.  
 
All teachers will receive professional development in language acquisition with a focus on best practices for co-teaching, using 
strategies, and integrating language and content instruction. All teachers will be required to dedicate fifteen percent of all 
professional development hours to ELL strategies, while ENL teachers will be required to dedicate fifty percent. Teachers 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

 

involved in providing P.D. will attend out of building P.D.'s in order to turn key the training to the remaining Title III staff. 
ENL teachers/Dual Language Teachers will meet every Friday, schedule permitting, during a common prep period (9:04-9:58 
am) with the ELL Coordinator. The following is a list of topics that will be covered, and the tentative dates of training, for these 
meetings:  
                   •       Mandates and Regulations for English Language Learners (September 2017)                   •       Understanding the 
Needs of Your ELL Population (November 2017)                   •       Using the New Language Progressions to Meet the CCLS for 
ELLs (October 2017)                   •       Thinking Maps strategies  for English Language Learners (September 2017- June 
2018)                   •       Lesson planning for ELLs: Language Objectives and  Academic Language Acquisition (September 
2017)                                                 •       Supporting English Language Learners through the use of technology (November 2017- 
December 2017)                                                 •       Supporting English Language Learners through  Project Based Learning 
(STEAM) (January 2017)                   •       Preparing ELL students for the NYSESLAT (February 2018- March 2018) 
 
 Workshops on math are offered with an outside consultant for the Metamorphosis Program, which involves all classroom 
teachers (K-5). Professional Development in math focuses on the use of models, manipulatives and other visual strategies that 
can enhance understanding for ELLs.   
 Technology workshops that enrich the instruction of ELLs are scheduled throughout the year. Some of the topics covered by 
the Technology Committee are; Hummingbird robotics, Dash and Dot robotics, Z-space, iMovie, and Garage Band.  
 
Teachers are expected to turnkey what they learn at outside workshops and also to complete Professional Development 
Reflection sheets, which encourage teachers to apply strategies that they were presented with and to reflect on how they can 
tweak instruction to be even more meaningful for ELLs. Site-based professional development (at the school) expands on what 
the outside workshops present and additionally brings in the benefits of visual literacy and oral language as successful tools for 
ELL instruction that is standards based.  
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
All staff responsible for part of the instruction of Ells will receive two hours of ELL-specific professional development during the 
school year. These workshops will focus on language acquisition startegies and best practices and will take place during the 
November and June Professional Development days. 
ENL/ Dual Language teachers meet weekly during a common prep for 50 minutes. During this weekly meeting, ELL specific 
training takes place.  
 
Supplementary workshops are provided at the school on topics related to helping ELLs meet the CCLS and how to modify and 
scaffold curriculum for ELLs. The school also believes in needs-based professional development and plans workshops 
throughout the year based on student data trends. Teachers participate in Lunch and Learns several times throughout the year 
to enhance their curriculum and instruction to meet the needs of ELLs. Professional development on best practices for ELLs will 
continue to be at the heart of the school's planning for workshops to provide both in house and through outside providers. A 
core team of ENL professionals is responsible for designing and implementing ENL professional development for all teachers. A 
calendar with all professional development workshops is kept in the main office.  
 
A binder is organized and maintained by the ENL Coordinator. It includes agendas and attendance records. Samples of

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL Coordinator schedules meetings with the ELL parents in conjunction with the classroom teacher. Parents are 
contacted through letters in their preferred language of communication to set the meeting. Meetings are scheduled after 
responses are collected. Parents who do not respond to the letters are contacted through phone calls. Parents who cannot 
attend in person meetings will be given the option of a phone conference to discuss students’ progress and concerns. The 
meeting or conference includes the classroom teacher and any other staff supporting the academic growth of the student. The 
meeting is conducted in the language of preference for the parent. If qualified staff is not available in the school to translate 
for the parent, arrangements should be made to provide a qualified translator for the parent.    
  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parents of ELLs play a vital part in their children's success in school.  Therefore, creating a strong partnership will ensure their 
children's educational growth towards achieving success in school.  In doing so, we pay special attention to the anxiety that 
parents of ELLs experience when they are invited to workshops at our school. It is for this reason that we take special care in 
designing workshops that make them feel comfortable and welcomed. It is our goal to empower parents of ELLs to feel 
confident about themselves and about helping their children achieve in school.  In addition, our school is focused on current 
research and data that support best practices in promoting the educational welfare of ELLs in our school. 
 
Monthly parental/guardian meetings are held each month during the day. The second grade ENL teacher and the Kidergarten 
Dual language teacher meet with parents of ELLs to inform them of the monthly units of study and share resources. These 
meetings also include tips and strategies that parents of ELL students can use to support their children's education. 
Additionally, specific workshops to support the content areas are planned based on a parent survey completed after the 
workshops. For example, a workshop for parents of ELLs about New York City history will be available. At these meetings, 
materials are given to parents in their native language.  This initiative helps parents communicate the content knowledge to 
their children. This kind of approach can empower parents by providing a vehicle for them to be invested in their children's 
educational growth and therefore building their confidence as well as the students’.   
 
Additionally, parents are invited to participate in all school meetings run by the PSA, Parent Coordinator, and CBOs. There are 
Title 1 academic workshops in all content areas, multicultural assembly performances, enrichment club culminating 
performances and a Back to School Blast (resources on health and community resources for parents) that ELL parents are 
involved in. This participation in school events really fosters positive experiences for ELL families and helps ELL students and 
parents feel comfortable and welcomed in the school community, a goal we pride ourselves on at P.S. 376.  Regular 
translations are provided at all parent meetings and events. Community-based organizations offer services and support to our 
parent community.  In addition,  the school has frequent parent workshops on topics ranging from how math periodic 
assessments help students to classes on health and fatherhood programs. Some of the meetings are site based and run by the 
school staff. Others are run by community organizations who come to the school and provide resources on topics of need in 
our community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maria Vera, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The school utilizes various resources to find out pertinent data about the student and parent body of P.S. 376. The 
ATS system reports that are used include the RHLA, UPPG, RESI and the home language and the NYCDOE 
preferred language of communication information that is inputted as part of a student profile into the system. 
Additionally the school refers to the blue emergency card data and other pertinent information in cumulative files 
that indicate the language of communication in the home. Additional information is accessed from the HLIS forms 
and the ELPC screen. All phone calls, conferences, and written communication sent to the families will be / is in 
the preferred language of communication. The school has a bilingual Parent Coordinator who is available and 
utilized to translate for all parent workshops and meetings. Additional personnel in the building include The ESL 
Coordinator, Speech Teacher, and Psychologist-- all bilingual pedagogues. Parents receive translated documents 
the same time as documents are sent to English speaking families. Translations are available at all meetings and 
events, in addition to via phone calls and written notifications. The school staff is aware of translation services 
available to parents who indicate a language preference not available in the school.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 
 

Written Preferred  

Percent Written  

 

 

Oral Preferred  

Percent Oral  

 

 

Language  

There are 250 English-
speaking parents in our 
school. Spanish is the 
language preferred by 240 
parents for both written 
and oral communication. 
Even though we have some 
additional home languages 
including Arabic (1 family), 
Chinese (2 families), and 
Turkish (1 family), these 
families prefer English as 
their method of oral and 
written communication.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

All documents sent from the school, 
both official from NYCDOE directly and 
with programming unique to the 
school, are prepared and sent home in 
English and Spanish at the same time. 
There is never a delay because a 
document needs a language other than 
English. One side of the document is 
always in English and the other is in 
Spanish. The Arabic speaking families 
also have English speakers in the home

so they are not in need of translation 
services at this time according to their 
requests as captured in school data. 
However whenever translations are 
available the school sends the 
documents home in English and Arabic. 
Programs such as Google Translate are 
useful in providing written 
communication in languages that 
pedagogues do not know.The school 
utilizes in house personnel such as The 
ESL Coordinator and The Parent 
Coordinator to help with translating 
the documents into Spanish and 
arranging translations via Google 
Translate. Additionally the personnel in 
the office is bilingual and can assist 
with needed Spanish translations for 
written communication as well.  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as 

parent-teacher  
conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to 

 

provide interpretation service(s)?  

 

There are multiple opportunities 
during the school year for teachers 
and other staff members to meet with 
the parents. At the beginning of the 
school year the parents are invited to 
curriculum night taking place on 
September 17 th . The ELL Coordinator 
reaches out to the parents of students 
identified as ELLs after being 
administered the NYSITELL and 
schedules an orientation meeting to 
notify parents of their child’s eligibility 
for ELL services and to provide 
information about program selection. 
There are three parent-teacher 
conferences scheduled during the 
year. The first one will take place on 
November 5, the second one is 
scheduled for March 3 and the last 
one will happen on May 11. The 
parents of ELL students meet to hear 
about their children’s progress 
sometime during the month of May. 
The attendance teacher reaches out to

parents of children who have 
attendance inconsistencies. In 
addition, teachers and parents can 
schedule appointments to meet on 
Tuesdays from 2:30 pm to 3:10 pm.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

P.S. 376 is committed to following Chancellor's Regulations Section A-663. Copies of the Bill of Parent Rights and 
Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services in English, Spanish, 
Chinese, and Arabic are available in the main office. Copies are also kept by the Parent Coordinator. We determine 
the home language of the family within 30 days of a student's enrollment. The school maintains appropriate records 
in ATS to ensure that we are following the regulation and that have copies of the Bill of Rights in the appropriate 
languages. We provide language translation and interpretation services to parents who require this. Parents have the 
right to choose a family or community member of their own or to utilize the translation and interpretation services 
offered at the school. The school respects parents' preferences. There is a notice indicating availability of 
interpretation services posted at the main entrance to the school. It has been translated into the most prominent 
languages in the area. The school hires a bilingual Parent Coordinator and ESL Coordinator so that translation and 
interpretation of written documents and at meetings can be conducted in Spanish. If it is necessary the school 
budgets for outside agencies to provide translation services when the language is not one of the nine most common 
languages. The school also utilizes Google Translate to translate documents. All communication is sent home at the 
same time as English notification is sent with no delay occurring because of the translatioon needs. Any documents 
with health, safety, legal and disciplinary matters and entitlement to program placements in Special Education, ESL or 
non standard academic programs are delivered to parents in their home language either through use of the school 
personnel or The DOE Translation Unit. The Parent Coordinator participates in periodic trainings that focus on the 
delivery of translation and interpretation services in order to ensure the school's compliance with this regulation. P.S. 
376 is highly committed to providing parents of all languages with information on school programs so that maximum 
participation and knowledge can occur among all and can ensure for happiness and success at the school.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Initially, the home language survey serves as the basis for determining the language needs in the school community. 
The school has a Parent Coordinator that reaches out to parents on a regular basis through PSA meetings, workshops, 
letters, flyers, monthly calendars, a designated bulletin board inside the school and with an LCD sign. Through these 
methods, the school works with the parent coordinator and the parents to evaluate their needs. A parent survey in 
which parents ask for information on specific services is also provided to parents during meetings and workshops with 
parents. In addition, the parent coordinator is always available to individually meet with parents and informally 
address their concerns. If a parent requests translation services or if a staff member requires it, the school contacts 
The Translation and Interpretation Unit to provide services.
