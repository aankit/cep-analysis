Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 58 is a community school that works diligently to meet the needs of all of its students. The staff has created a 
mission and a vision together that strives to promote student learning in the most positive way. It is our mission to 
work collaboratively in viewing our students through a holistic lens in order to meet their individual needs in a variety 
of ways. It is our vision to create a community of knowledgeable, independent and engaged learners. This vision 
helps us frame all aspects of our instruction for our students. We believe our students will be most successful when 
they are given the tools to think critically and explore new topics that are both challenging and exciting to them. As a 
school we know that students learn best when they feel they are part of a community where they feel safe. The social 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

and emotional development of our students must be nurtured as well as their academic development. These three 
key components are required to create knowledgeable students who are inspired to learn. We strive to teach out 
students that hard work in connection with respect and kindness can lead to a rich future.  

 

 
  

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The PS 58 community relies on collaboration with its many stakeholders. The students depend on a strong 
knowledgeable staff. A teaching staff that is continually learning from each other helps push our students to the next 
level. The students depend on a strong home-school connection that is predicated on a shared vision. We accomplish 
this by opening our doors regularly to families. We value family input and ideas. Parents are our students’ first 
teachers. Our teachers take that foundation and collaborate with families to raise our children’s knowledge base.  

Collaboration at PS 58 stretches to all subject areas. We put an emphasis on stretching our students’ minds in the area 
of the arts. This helps students of all ability levels to shine. This also helps teach students critical skills, compassion 
and perseverance. By infusing our instruction with projects and the arts we inspire learners. We look at both visual 
arts and performing arts as pillars of a strong education. To enrich instruction PS58 partners with outside 
organizations through in class programming to enhance our curriculum and children’s learning. Some of these 
partnerships include: New York City Ballet, Metropolitan Opera, New York Historical Society, Dancing Classrooms, 
chess and yoga residencies. PS 58 has shown strength in the ability to build strong family and community ties, one of 
the key elements in the framework for great schools. 

Student needs can be met at PS 58 in a variety of programs. Our special education programs address the needs of 
many different types of learners. Our classrooms are made up of general education classes with integrated co-
teaching and dual language programming. We offer students a self-contained setting for more support as well as 
special education teacher support services.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 58 has a strong support staff comprised of service providers, a school assessments team, academic intervention 
providers and paraprofessionals who all collaborate to meet the needs of all types of learners. We pride ourselves on 
addressing the needs of different types of learners as soon as they are identified. There are systems in place to 
respond to needs as they present themselves. These systems include flexible child study teams, school 
implementation teams and instructional leadership teams. These teams work to build a collaborative environment of 
educators, a second key element in the framework for great schools. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

By looking at a variety of data sources, we have learned that students will benefit from an increased focus on 
vocabulary, content areas and small-group instruction. By concentrating our efforts on vocabulary and content area 
instruction, we will challenge our students to think more critically through their acquisition and use of academic 
vocabulary. Small group instruction builds student-teacher rapport and provides opportunities to target individual 
academic needs thus laying the foundation for a supportive and differentiated environment for learning. PS 58 uses 
multiple curricula sources to meet the varied needs of our students  

During our School Leadership Team meetings, we brainstorm ways that teachers and families will collaborate together 
to help our students develop as 21st century learners. Many parents and teachers strongly identified a need for 
increased technology instruction. For the 2018-2019 school year, our technology teacher will work in close 
collaboration with teachers in grades 2, 3, 4 and 5 to provide this instruction through a team-teaching model. 
Together, teachers in these grades plan with the technology teacher to innovate and hone their practice. We aim to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

keep families informed and provide them with useful information that can better the lives of our students. We 
provide school-based workshops on topics of interest for parents such as how to support your child’s learning at 
home, what to expect on each grade, how to talk to your child about their school day and what do reading levels 
really mean. This year we will be using data obtained from a family survey regarding parent workshops to respond to 
the changing needs in our community.

open our doors to families in many ways. We use a learning leader program for family volunteers, we use parents 
volunteers for different times of day each day, we ask families who are willing and able to share expertise with 
classrooms on a regular basis. As we continue to grow as a school and the changing needs of students become more 
prevalent we need to focus on the areas where we would like to see more parent partnership. We hope to work with 
families to implement our independence continuum to help grow our students to be responsible citizens.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS58, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

PS58 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS58, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing 
a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this 
Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic 
achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children 
achieve State Standards on assessments.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

  schedule and duration 
 
language of instruction 
  # and types of certified teachers 
 

types of materials  

Begin description here:            
Rationale: Our after school program will focus on supporting the English-language development 
of newcomers and entering to transitioning ELLs, however all current English-language learners 
will be invited. Our visual arts focus offers a venue for self-expression for ELLs. Their artwork 
will be a springboard for discussions with teachers and classmates, and their vocabularies will 
grow as they learn new words and phrases associated with art making techniques and materials 
as well as content.  The narrative elements in their artwork, and in much of the artwork of known 
artists, invite students to discuss characterization, setting, mood, and story line. 
Each lesson will begin with a thoughtfully chosen read aloud (mindful of cultural relevance) that 
complements the painting, drawing and/or collage skill.  Artists and works of art (most from 
New York City art institutions) are integrated into the lessons to enhance instruction.  Artists will 
be chosen with diversity in mind to ensure that students are exposed to a wide range of life 
experiences and perspectives that are conveyed through the visual arts. 
We will be using a unit of study called ELLs and the Visual Arts: Developing Self Expression 
and Language through Visual Arts.  There is no cost for this curriculum, although we will have 
to purchase the materials needed to create the artwork.  The 11 individual sessions/lessons of the 
unit are strongly linked to each other. Often work created in one session is used in a follow up 
session.  New vocabulary words are introduced in each session and added to a word wall. In 
practicing the new vocabulary, students will write phrases and sentences to add to the word 
wall.  Students will also title and write brief descriptions about their work and will keep art 
journals that include sketches, descriptive writing and a glossary. Throughout, students are 
encouraged to discuss their own artwork, that of their peers, and the artwork in 
museums.  Outcomes are assessed through teacher observations of paired and small group 
discussions, one-on-one discussions between student and teacher, review of student art journals 
and critique of written descriptions of artwork.   
Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served: Our visual arts after school program will be 
offered to all ELLs in grades 1-5.  Letters will be sent home to parents in late November/early 
December in the parents' preferred languages.  We will split the students into two groups: grades 
1 and 2 will be together and grades 3-5 will form the second group.  We anticipate 15 students in 
each group and 2 teachers in each group (7.5 students per teacher). Each group will have one 
ESL-certified teacher and one dual language teacher (French/English).  The ENL 
teacher/coordinator will support each group by taking attendance, distributing snack and supplies 
and helping students during work time and clean up.  The same unit of study will be used in both 
groups however we will modify it to ensure that the content and skills are developmentally 
appropriate for each group.  The picture books, for example, will be different in each group. 
Language of Instruction: the language of instruction will be English. Bilingual teachers will also 
teach the program and will be able to support our French-dominant, emerging-English ELLs. 
# and types of certified teachers:  1 fully certified, stand-alone English as a New Language 
teacher, 2 ESL-certified classroom teachers, 2 dual language (French/English) classroom 
teachers 
The program will be offered on Thursday afternoons from 3:15 - 5:15 pm.  There will be a total 
of 13 sessions beginning Thursday, January 10, 2019 and ending Thursday, April 11, 2019.  The

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
curriculum is 11 sessions but we will have a total of 13 sessions, one at beginning to introduce 
the program to students and to gauge prior knowledge and one at the end to celebrate the end of 
the program with parents.  Parents will have an opportunity to do a gallery walk to see student 
work.   
5 teachers x 13 sessions x 2 hours x $60.65 = $7, 884.50 
Types of Materials: copies of Developing Self Expression and Language through Visual Arts: 
Painting, Drawing and Collage unit of study (ELLs and the Visual Arts), watercolor paint, white 
paper for painting, lined paper for writing, pencils, markers, paint brushes, tempera paint, and 
multicultural/diverse picture books to use during the read aloud component of the after school 
program.  
The budget contains a list of trade books we would like to use during our After School program 
(to be purchased through GI Group and Mondo Publishing).  They were selected for their 
illustrations, social justice focus and cultural relevance.  Also included in the list are books about 
Poland as we have a newcomer first grader from Poland and very few books about her 
country/culture.  We are also in need of English-language resources for our newcomer ELLs who 
scored at the entering/emerging level.  Thus, we have included copies of Practice Exercises in 
Basic English (via Continental Press, Inc.) and copies of blackline masters of WONDERS for 
English Learners: Language Development Practice (via McGraw Hill Education).

We will continue with our small group diversity teams, which meet every Tuesday morning from 
8:00 to 8:45 am and include all teaching staff (administrators, teachers and paraprofessionals). 
These meetings will be held indefinitely, at least through the end of the calendar year, for a total 
of 10 sessions (10 x 45 minutes = 7.5 hours). Agendas and attendance sheets are available at 
every session.  In these groups, we discuss racial justice and how we can promote cultural 
competence in our classrooms.  This directly impacts our ELL population. Additionally, 
members of the P.S. 58 Diversity Team, which includes the ENL teacher and dual language 
teachers, and the five teachers participating in the Title III ELL after school program will meet in 
book clubs to discuss White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism

Part C: Professional Development  
by Robin DiAngelo (Beacon Press). This book has been the guiding text for our ongoing small 
group work, and we'd like to purchase five copies of the text to support our in-school 
professional development.  As noted below in the budget, each copy is $16.00.  Our Diversity 
Team meets once a month (on Wednesdays) during parent engagement time.  There are two 
parents on the team.  Here are the dates of our meetings: 9/26/18, 10/17/18, 11/14/18, 12/12/18, 
1/23/18, 2/13/18, 3/27/18, 4/17/18, 5/22/18, 6/19/18.  We keep minutes, provide an agenda and 
participants sign an attendance sheet.  
In December 2018, the teachers participating in the Title III ELL after school program will meet 
two times after school to discuss the Developing Self Expression and Language through Visual 
Arts unit.  An agenda will be made available to participants and participants will sign an 
attendance sheet.  We will look at each lesson and critique the picture book recommendations 
and artists to ensure that a wide range of perspectives are represented including those of our 
students’ home countries/languages.  As all of the works of art in the curriculum are viewable in 
local NYC museums, which want to make sure that immigrant “voices” are also being heard. We 
will modify the unit of study as necessary to maximize cultural relevance and diversity. 
One of the goals of the Diversity Team is to take an inventory of our materials and books, and to 
make book lists by theme, grade to promote multiculturalism and diversity in our building. For 
the Title III ELL after school program, we intend to utilize and expand upon this work so that we 
can use picture books for read alouds that support our work in fostering cultural competence 
among our students and staff.   
Our staff will continue to attend Talking About Race in the Classroom trainings that are 
regularly offered by The Center for Racial Justice in Education.  Some staff members attended 
trainings during the 2017-2018 school year. We will prioritize training for the teachers 
participating in the Title III After School program.  The next training for teachers will be held on 
12/13/18 from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm. The cost is $150/person and we would like to train the five 
teachers working the Title III ELL after school program.  
Here is a description of the training: Through this training, educators strengthen their analysis of 
how racism manifests in schools and classrooms, enhance their understanding of how racism 
affects children, practice utilizing tools to address race and racism with students, and gain 
strategies to support a school-wide culture of respect, equity and inclusivity. 
 
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

This winter we will schedule a Saturday visit a local art museum to view one (or more) of the 
works of art we’ve been studying. The Saturday field trip will be open to students and their 
parents in both programs (grades 1-2 and 3-5), and at least one French-speaking dual language 
teacher will accompany the group in order provide translation and interpretation services to 
participating parents. The ENL teacher will attend.  The trip will last approximately 4 hours and 
the group will travel to the museum by subway. The two teachers will be paid 4 hours (per 
session) for this activity.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
In addition, we will have an end of the after school program celebration for all participating 
students and their parents (grades 1-2 and 3-5).  We will showcase student work in a gallery walk 
in our building.  The ENL coordinator will invite parents to this event via letter in the parents’ 
preferred language of communication.  Parents will sign an attendance sheet.   
 Title III funds will be used for refreshments, cultural food and snacks during these activities. 
In March 2019, the ENL coordinator will hold two NYSESLAT information meetings for all 
parents of ELLs during our Wednesday morning parent engagement time (8:00 - 8:45 am).  An 
agenda and attendance sheet will be made available. 
All letters to parents concerning the Title III ELL after school program will be sent to 
parents/guardians in their preferred language. This includes the program invitation/sign-up form, 
the permission slip for the local museum field trip, the NYSESLAT information meeting and the 
invitation to the end of the program celebration. 
We would also like to offer parents of ELLs in our after school program an opportunity to attend 
a Talking About Race for Parents training offered regularly by the Center for Racial Justice in 
Education.  Four parents from the Title III after school program will attend this training.  The 
next training will take place on December 8 from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm and the cost is 
$65/person.  Here is a description of the training:  
This training provides parents, guardians and caregivers with strategies for how to talk about 
race and racism with their children. Participants learn how children see race, gain skills for 
approaching age-appropriate conversations with a racial equity lens, and practice strategies to 
promote positive racial identity development in children. 
In addition, our parent coordinator invites all parents, including parents of ELLs, to workshops, 
meetings and trainings that take place throughout the school year. Notices are sent home via 
backpack mail and email in parents' preferred languages.  Agendas and attendance sheets are also 
made available.  These events include, but are not limited to, the following: New PS 58 Parents' 
Q & A with parent coordinator (September 24, 2018 from 9:00 - 9:45 am in the cafeteria), 5th 
grade Parent/Guardian Workshop on D15 Middle School Admissions/New Policies (September 
25, 2018 from 9:00 to 10:30 am in the cafeteria), Lunch Volunteer Training for parents and 
guardians in K and 1 (9:00 am in cafeteria), Learning Partners Volunteer Training (October 24, 
2018 from 9:00 - 10:30 am in the library), Stress Management Parent Workshop (November 9, 
2018 from 9:00 to 10:00 am in the cafeteria).

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 58K uses the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project (TCRWP) assessments for English-language arts (ELA). This 
includes running records aligned to the Fountas and Pinnell leveling system, sight word assessments, TCRWP writing rubrics, 
letter/sound assessments, spelling inventories, and concepts of print assessments. Teachers also supplement these 
assessment tools with their own teacher-created rubrics for ELA and content area writing assignments and projects.  These are 
developed collaboratively through regular grade meetings and vertical team meetings, and the specific needs of ELLs at every 
proficiency level are taken into consideration. NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results are also used as assessment tools.  For math, we 
use the unit assessments in the Common Core-aligned Investigations program as well as Engage NY modules and teacher-
created assessments, which are tailored to the particular needs of students, including ELLs.  
In the dual language program, teachers use Canadian running records (GB+) in French, which are also leveled according to 
Fountas and Pinnell. Dual language teachers have developed their own letter/sound assessments, sight word assessments, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

exemplars, writing rubrics, spelling inventories, and concepts of print assessments.  
    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

As mentioned above, teacher-created rubrics for ELA and content area writing assignments and projects are developed 
collaboratively through regular grade meetings and vertical team meetings.  The specific needs of ELLs at every proficiency 
level are taken into consideration.  
Data shows that - overall - ELLs are performing at lower proficiency levels in reading and writing than their English-proficient 
peers.  As a result, we have included more ELL-specific strategies in our professional development sessions.  Our ENL teacher 
conducts workshops during the professional development time and offers feedback and suggestions to her colleagues during 
grade and vertical team meetings.  She shares with teachers resources and scaffolding for struggling readers and writers 
including graphic organizers, visuals, sentence starters, realia, opportunities for hands-on and real life experiences and high-
interest, ELL-friendly and multicultural literature.   
P.S. 58K has also created vertical teams of teachers for professional development purposes.  Having identified writing as the 
weakest area for most ELLs, the ENL teacher has become a member of the writing team and shares with classroom teachers 
strategies for helping ELLs better access TCRWP writing units and content area writing assignments and projects.  The ENL 
teacher also helps teachers create language objectives. 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
TCRWP running records and writing rubrics serve as our baseline/benchmark assessments in reading and writing.  In math, we 
use assessments in the Common Core-aligned Investigations program, supplemented by Engage NY modules and teacher-
created tasks.  In the dual language program, teachers use Canadian running records (GB+) in French, which are also leveled 
according to Fountas and Pinnell. Dual language teachers have developed their own letter/sound assessments, sight word 
assessments, exemplars, writing rubrics, spelling inventories, and concepts of print assessments.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

P.S. 58K offers a range of intervention support, which is available to all students, including ELLs.  We have two reading 
recovery teachers that work with students in grade 1.  We also have two AIS (Academic Intervention Services) teachers; one 
who supports the lower grades and the other AIS teacher works with students in the upper grades.  In addition, our language 
workshop specialty teacher, who is also a certified bilingual (French/English) teacher, pushes in to dual language classrooms to 
offer AIS to students in both the lower and upper grades.  She collaborates with the dual language classrooms teachers to 
customize AIS instruction in order to meet students' individual needs, including French-speaking ELLs.   
 
ELLs who have an IEP are eligible to receive academic intervention through our two SETSS teachers.  We also have speech, 
occupational and physical therapy teachers on staff.  In addition, a number of our special education ICT classroom teachers 
have been trained in the Orton-Gillingham and Wilson Language Training programs and use these strategies in the classroom 
to help struggling readers and writers, including ELLs.  
 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
In order to guide instruction for ELLs, we look at data from the NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, TCRWP running records and writing 
rubrics, state tests, teacher-created tasks, and informal daily assessments.  We then customize instruction to address the 
individual needs of ELLs.  For example, some students may need support in decoding, others in improving 
comprehension.  Service providers, including the ENL teacher, regularly communicate with one another and classroom 
teachers to create targeted lessons and activities.  Resources, such as manipulatives and books, are also shared among 
teachers.   
If an ELL is identified as possibly needing formal intervention, his/her case is presented at Child Study.  Our child study team is 
comprised of various service providers, special education teachers and ESL-certified teachers.  The classroom teacher (s) 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

present the student's case and speak to the child's specific needs.  The team then discusses instructional strategies that can be 
used in the classroom as a Tier 1 intervention.  After a few weeks, the team reconvenes to determine whether or not 
additional Tier 2 interventions are needed.  In the first cycle, the student is reassessed after six weeks.  If further support is 
needed, Tier 3 supports will be provided to the child.  As a school, we are using Leveling Literacy Library as a way to assess 
progress in RTI. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data from our most recent NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results show that students become proficient in speaking and listening 
prior to developing proficiency in reading and writing.  The area where ELLs struggle the most is in writing.  NYSITELL data also 
reveals that students entering our French/English dual language program in the upper grades perform better on the reading 
and writing portions.  We do not have any SIFE students.  ELLs who have an IEP tend to remain at the expanding level 
(advanced) on the NYSESLAT and therefore become long-term ELLs.  Also, they score no higher than a 2 on the 
NYS ELA test.  They are much less likely to exit the ENL program than non-ELL-SWDs.  In the 2016 - 2017 school year, one non-
IEP ELL tested out of the ENL program in spite of scoring at the expanding level on the 2016 NYSESLAT.  He did so after scoring 
a 3 on the 2016 NYS ELA test.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our ENL teacher analyzes RLAT data from ATS.  She then shares it with the administration and with classroom teachers.  The 
ENL teacher offers workshops on the NYSESLAT to raise awareness within the school community of the skills ELLs need in order 
to perform well on the NYSESLAT.  She discusses with classroom teachers which of the four sub-groups (speaking, listening, 
reading, writing) ELLs need most support in.  Teachers can then tailor instruction to meet the individual needs of the ELLs in 
their classroom.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In this program, the ENL teacher pushes in to heterogeneous (same grade) classrooms in order to provide services to 
ELLs.  Whenever possible, non French-speaking ELLs in each grade are placed in the same classroom to avoid having to 
be pulled out of the classroom for language support.  The ENL teacher is mindful of incorporating home language 
support through appropriate resources (bilingual dictionaries and trade books, etc.). According to their proficiency 
levels, students receive the mandated amount of instruction in both stand-alone ENL, delivered by the ENL teacher, as 
well as integrated ENL, delivered by the ENL teacher along with a Common Branch-certified co-teacher.  In 
kindergarten, two of our general education teachers have ESL certification.  Therefore, non French-speaking ELLs in 
kindergarten are placed in their classrooms but also receive support through our ENL teacher.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

The dual language program uses two models to support sequential biliteracy: self-contained classes in K-2 and side-
by- side classes in 3-5. Within the self-contained configuration, there is one teacher who provides instruction in both 
languages at separate times. The classroom contains instructional materials in both languages and is organized so that 
the language of instruction is clearly designated (i.e. color codes for language, flower pin indicating language of 
instruction). The teacher plans what concepts and activities s/he will conduct in each of the languages. Within the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

side-by-side class configuration, there are two teachers who provide instruction; one in French and one in English. 
They follow an alternate day pattern. One day of instruction is in English and one day is in French. Each classroom 
contains instructional materials in the appropriate language and the teachers plan what concepts and activities they 
will conduct in each of the languages.  All ELLs in the dual language program are in heterogeneous single-grade 
classes. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

In the freestanding ENL program, the ENL teacher pushes in to provide the ENL instructional minutes and to provide 
appropriate ELA minutes in conjunction with the classroom teacher (s).   The ENL teacher co-plans with classroom teachers to 
provide additional scaffolds and supports for students in order to access curriculum content. Teachers in the French/English 
dual language program co-plan with their grade teams to plan units of study and then plan together as a team to provide 
additional scaffolds and strategies for ELLs in order to access curriculum content.  The ENL teacher services students in grades 
K through 5 who are not enrolled in the French/English dual language program.  ELLs receive services with the following 
allocation:  
Entering: Stand alone (180 minutes) + Integrated ENL (180 minutes) = 360 minutes per week 
Emerging: Stand alone (90 minutes) + Integrated ENL (180 minutes) + Flex (90 minutes) = 360 minutes per week 
Transitioning: Integrated (90 minutes) + Flex (90 minutes) = 180 minutes per week 
Expanding: Integrated (180 minutes)  
Commanding: Flex (90 minutes)   
  
In the French/English dual language, in grades K-2, the bilingual certified teacher provides the appropriate number of ENL, ELA, 
and HLA minutes according to proficiency level. In the grades 3-5 French/English dual language program, the English-side 
teachers, who are all bilingual or ESL-certified, provide the appropriate number of ENL and ELA instructional minutes according 
to proficiency level. The French-side teacher provides the appropriate number of HLA minutes.  ELLs receive services with the 
following allocation:  
Entering: Stand alone (180 minutes) + Integrated ENL (180 minutes) = 360 minutes per week 
Emerging: Stand alone (90 minutes) + Integrated ENL (180 minutes) + Flex (90 minutes) = 360 minutes per week 
Transitioning: Integrated (90 minutes) + Flex (90 minutes) = 180 minutes per week 
Expanding: Integrated (180 minutes)  
Commanding: Flex (90 minutes)   
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
French/English Dual Language Program  
All content area instruction is carefully planned to include language objectives as well as content objectives.  Teachers plan for 
content-obligatory language objectives (language skills that are fundamental to the content area) in addition to content-
compatible language objectives (other related language skills compatible with the content being taught). Content-obligatory 
and content-compatible language objectives include the following language skills: (1) Functions (requesting/giving information, 
comparing/contrasting, describing, retelling, and summarizing), (2) Vocabulary (according to the topic/theme), and (3) 
Grammar (question formation, adjective agreement, and comparatives). 
In the dual language program, language support is provided via word walls, read alouds, visuals, shared readings and the 
reading and writing workshops for vocabulary development. Social Studies is also the vehicle to introduce Francophone 
culture to the dual language classes. Similarly, bilingual teachers integrate science with literacy components to foster language 
acquisition and development in the L2. Math is mostly taught in English with support in French through math games and math 
vocabulary work for academic language development. Math and Social Studies are also taught in small group instruction 
through heterogeneous language groupings to encourage language exchange. Our school uses aspects of Math Investigations 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

to help ELLs experience math in real life applications. Science, art, drama, strings program (grades 3-5), physical education are 
taught in English by specialty teachers.  In the lower grades, music is taught in French and English by a bilingual music teacher. 
Dual Language classrooms include instructional resources in French and English. Classroom libraries include books and other 
printed materials appropriate for both groups of students; those learning English as a second language and those who are 
second language learners of French. Classroom libraries contain authentic literature (written by authors in French) and content 
area materials in both languages. 
In grades 3-5, dual language language classrooms include instructional resources in the instructional language of the teacher. 
Students also have access to dictionaries and online resources to assist with language development. Classroom libraries 
include books and other printed materials. Teachers also have access to a guided reading closet and authentic literature to 
help students acquire language. 
At P.S. 58K, students receive science instruction from our science specialty teachers at least once a week. In addition, 
classroom teachers design ELA and NLA units of study that integrate social studies and science. This has proven to reinforce 
students' academic vocabulary and structures in the target language.  Students use academic language to add details to their 
stories. They are writing one narrative in both languages. By spending at least five periods a week on this project, students 
acquire and master the academic vocabulary of that unit. Language in the content areas is made accessible thanks to 
interactive word walls created by and for students, a large selection of non-fiction books in both languages, and small group 
work. 
  
Freestanding ENL Program 
The Freestanding ENL program at P.S. 58K follows the Part 154 mandates providing the appropriate number of instructional 
minutes according to students' proficiency levels.  Content instruction is delivered in English with home language support 
provided via bilingual dictionaries and bilingual trade books.   
To support content instruction and English language development, all classrooms have:  
•Print rich materials  
access to technology (SmartBoards, Chromebooks, document readers) 
•Word Wall with pictures  
•Multilingual and multicultural libraries 
•Listening Centers  
•Strategy charts related to the current unit of study in reading, writing and math  
•Charts modeling correct language usage 
 •Flow of the Day times with pictures  
•Realia – visual aides/real objects to help students access prior knowledge and learn vocabulary 
The freestanding ENL program utilizes a wide variety of instructional materials. Fiction and non-fiction books are used to help 
ELLs gain access to content and TCRWP writing and reading strategies.  Also incorporated in the program are visuals, including 
photography, bilingual dictionaries, picture dictionaries and computer software. 
  
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Newly admitted Spanish-speaking students who are identified as ELLs are administered the Spanish LAB-R in order to 
determine language dominance. We do not administer the ELE as we do not offer a Spanish bilingual program.  Students who 
have arrived within one year of the New York State Math and Science tests take these tests in their native language. Because 
the New York State tests are not translated into French, a certified bilingual teacher orally translates the tests for the students. 
All other languages are administered if the test is available in the native language. These students do not take the ELA state 
test within their first year of arrival. 
In the dual language program, we also assess students in reading in French thanks to a Canadian-translated version of the 
Rigby PM Ultra Benchmark Kit (GB+ Trousse d’évaluation). Students are assessed at least four times a year 
(Sept/Nov/Mar/June) to assess growth. We also developed a spelling inventory in French, a list of high frequency words in 
French, a letter/sound recognition assessment and writing rubrics to assess students in their native tongue.

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. Our plan for Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) includes identifying these students as soon as possible when 
admitted. We then make individualized education plans according to their needs. We currently do not have any SIFE students, 
and we have no history of having SIFE students. 
 
b. Newcomers who score at the entering or emerging levels on the NYSITELL/NYSESLAT receive the mandated 360 minutes of 
ENL instruction a week. They are taught in small groups to maximize opportunities to work on listening, speaking, reading and 
writing. They are given instruction in both basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS) and content area instruction, as well 
as taught through collaborative interactive projects involving music, drama, and the arts. P.S. 58K also recognizes the 
importance of native language support in developing English proficiency. Newcomers are encouraged to use their native 
language to express their thoughts and ideas.  We offer native language support for newcomers and have been adding 
bilingual and native language books to our library.  These are available for students to take home and read with their parents 
in their native language, which strengthens the home-school connection.   
 
c. According to our data, ELLs receiving services for more than three years need additional support in writing. In order to 
bolster this particular skill, P.S. 58K has developed a transition plan to support students in reaching the proficiency level in 
writing. The ENL teacher collaborates closely with the classroom teachers to support writing by using ESL methodology. In 
both the freestanding ENL program and the dual language program, teachers work with small groups and individual ELLs who 
have not yet met the performance standard in writing. Long-term ELLs are strongly encouraged to attend our Title III after 
school program, where students practice their writing skills through storytelling. Accountable talk fosters stronger writing 
responses to literature. We encourage accountable talk by including ELLs in the reading buddy and peer tutoring programs. In 
addition, the ENL and dual language teachers confer with ELLs in small groups or individually.  ENL and bilingual teachers also 
tailor word work and writing strategies to increase the use of advanced language structures and academic vocabulary. Finally, 
close communication with classroom teachers and service providers also helps to customize instruction to meet students’ 
specific academic goals and needs. Dual language teachers examine students’ strengths in reading and writing across 
languages to identify positive transfer of skills and/or the lack thereof. 
 
d. Based on our current data, the students who are at risk of becoming long-term ELLs are students with IEPs (individualized 
education programs). In order to address their particular needs, the ENL and dual language teachers collaborate closely with 
special education teachers, the School Based Support Team (SBST), and the SETTS teachers to analyse student work and 
behaviors and to give these ELLs extra support, including helping them prepare for the NYS tests. In addition, the ENL teacher 
has regular meetings with the SBST to closely monitor ELLs with IEPs. This collaboration allows us to focus on our students’ 
specific academic needs, to monitor their progress, and to adjust instruction as needed. 
 
e. Former ELLs are provided additional instruction by both their classroom and ENL teacher and receive 90 minutes of ENL per 
week, which is co-taught with a Common Branch-certified teacher for students in the freestanding program, and provided by 
their bilingual-certified English-side teacher in the dual language program.  Whenever possible, former ELLs are placed in the 
same classrooms as current ELLs to facilitate mandated servicing.       
 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The ENL teacher collaborates closely with classroom teachers to support students' access to academic content areas.  In both 
the freestanding ENL program and the dual language program, teachers work with ELL-SWDs in small groups, as well as 
individually, to support comprehension and the students' English language development. During the literacy block, ENL and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

bilingual teachers support ELL-SWDs through the use of tailored word work, guided reading, realia, and oral language 
development. During content area instruction, the ENL teacher also uses a variety of strategies to help ELL-SWDs access 
content. This involves previewing vocabulary, differentiating texts according to students’ proficiency levels, working in small 
groups, and providing additional picture support. In writing, both the ENL and classroom teachers provide students with 
alternative graphic organizers, and ELL-SWDs have many opportunities to receive individual support.  In math, 
manipulatives and customized teacher-created materials are used with ELL-SWDs.  Whenever possible, native language 
literature is incorporated and encouraged. These instructional strategies allow ELL-SWDs greater access to grade level 
content.  The grade level materials used include, but are not limited to, grade level texts and content vocabulary. Work is 
differentiated to meet students' needs but remains grade level appropriate. The ENL and dual language teachers collaborate 
closely with special education teachers, the School Based Support Team (SBST), and the SETTS teachers to give students extra 
support. In addition, the ENL program has regular meetings with the SBST to closely monitor the ELL students who have 
Individual Education Plans (IEP). This collaboration allows us to focus on our students’ specific academic needs, to monitor 
their progress, and adjust instruction as needed. Furthermore, dual language teachers examine students’ strengths in reading 
and writing across languages to identify positive transfer of skills and/or the lack thereof. The school ensures that all ELL-SWDs 
receive the services mandated on their IEPs through close collaboration with the SBST. All teachers of ELL-SWDs are given 
copies of the IEPs and attend annual meetings to update them. 
 
In the upper grades, all students use Flocabulary, which is "a learning program for all grades that uses educational hip-hop 
music to engage students and increase achievement across the curriculum. Flocabulary’s standards-based videos, instructional 
activities and student creativity tools supplement instruction and develop core literacy skills" (flocabulary.com).  
  
Our technology specialist works with grades 2-5 students, including ELL-SWDs.  Students use Chromebooks to work on writing 
projects and to learn how to access texts online.   
  
The ENL teacher and select classroom teachers provide an afterschool digital storytelling program to ELLs in grades 3-5.  We 
use We Video, an online program,  to support writing, listening and speaking as well as narrative story telling. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
P.S. 58 allows for a great amount of curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs 
within the least restrictive environment. Our ENL teacher pushes in to ICT classes on different grades and works with ELL-
SWDs both individually and in small groups.  Our ENL teacher collaborates closely with ICT teachers in order to help ELL-
SWDs access content area material.  In each classroom, the ENL teacher builds a library of a wide range of books and materials 
that support the classroom's current unit of study in math, ELA, social studies and science.  ELL-SWDs can access these 
materials during independent reading and when the ENL teacher is present.  The ENL teacher also pushes in to the 12-1-1 self-
contained class to work with ELL-SWDs.  She collaborates closely with the special education teacher to provide targeted 
instruction.  The ENL teacher also attends IEP meetings for the ELL-SWDs she services, and she works with the school-based 
support team, families and classroom teachers to make recommendations and to help determine appropriate classroom 
placement.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our targeted intervention program for ELLs includes AIS in both the lower and upper grades as well as reading recovery for 
struggling ELLs in grade 1. ELLs in need of these services are identified at the beginning of the year, and additional students are 
added to the intervention rosters throughout the course of the year.    
In addition, ELLs are invited to a Title III ELL afterschool program.  In grades K-2, ELLs develop their English-language skills 
through storytelling and puppetry.  For ELLs in grades 3-5, we offer a digital storytelling program, which is focused on further 
developing ELLs' writing and speaking skills.   
French-speaking ELLs in the French/English dual language program (grades K-5) receive targeted AIS in both French and English 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

through our language workshop teacher.   
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year we will be refining our Title III after-school program to emphasize writing and speaking skills. The after-school 
program has been expanded to include ELLs in grades K-2.   
 
At P.S. 58K, we have launched schoolwide initiatives to celebrate our diversity and to promote tolerance throughout our 
school community.  High-quality, multicultural read alouds with social justice messages are at the heart of these initiatives.  In 
supporting this, our ENL teacher received curriculum grant money to order multicultural books that feature immigrants and 
refugees.  As we have students from Yemen and Sudan, our ENL teacher is currently adding more books about the Muslim 
experience to our library.  Our school has created a bulletin board that highlights our school's diversity.  The countries our 
families and staff come from are listed on a world map.  Although we have few Spanish-speaking ELLs, we do have students 
and staff members from Spain and Latin America. Therefore, our ENL teacher, together with student input, is designing a 
program to celebrate Hispanic Heritage this fall.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Field trips, the annual school musical, in-school programming 
such as chess, Met Opera and ballroom dancing, are all available to ELLs in grades K-5.   The Carroll Kids after school program is 
held every day and is open to all students.  Many teachers at P.S. 58K lead after school enrichment programs.  Scholarships are 
provided by the PTA for those students whose families financially qualify. Beginning in January, there is a free Title III after 
school program offered to all ELLs in grades K-5. In grades K-2, ELLs develop their English-language skills through storytelling 
and puppetry.  For ELLs in grades 3-5, we offer a digital storytelling program, which is focused on further developing ELLs' 
writing and speaking skills.  The Title III after school program is exclusively for ELLs and former ELLs and meets once every week 
for approximately four months.  It is run by the ENL and dual language teachers and is supported by additional Common 
Branch teachers.  Parents of ELLs are made aware of this program through letters sent home in the parents' preferred 
language of communication.  Families of ELLs are invited to all P.S. 58K events and are encouraged to participate in classroom 
celebrations.   
 
Our language workshop specialty teacher reaches out to parents of ELLs to invite them to speak to grades K-2 students about 
their home languages and cultural backgrounds.  In addition to teaching French and Spanish as a foreign language, our 
language workshop specialty teacher makes an effort to expose students to as many different languages represented in our 
school as possible.  In order to do this, parent support is required.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Families of ELLs have access to books in Spanish and Arabic in the ENL room and in the school library.  Parents also have access 
to over 1,200 French books in the school library. Francophone parent volunteers help French-speaking families check out 
books twice a week to increase access to these resources. The dual language classrooms are equipped with equal numbers of 
French and English resources to reinforce the equal importance of both languages. Materials include: authentic literature 
written by Francophone authors, Francophone authors from France, Africa, and Canada; phonics games in French, French 
guided reading materials; leveled books in French, and big books in French for shared reading. 
Most classrooms throughout the school are equipped with SMART Boards and Document Readers to enhance visual aspects of 
learning for ELLs.  There are several Chromebook laptop carts throughout the building for students to use. Classroom teachers 
in the upper grades use Google Docs as another way to confer with students.  Students type their writing pieces on Google 
Docs and teachers are able to comment directly on each student's document.  Students also peer edit and collaborate with 
one another through Google Docs.  Google Classroom is used by teachers to share with students materials to help them with 
their assignments and projects. As previously mentioned, we also use the Flocabulary literacy program with students, including 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

ELLs.    
Our language workshop specialty teacher uses a variety of online resources to teach foreign languages to students in K-
2.  These include Quizlet and YouTube for songs in French, Spanish and other languages.   
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

French/English dual language teachers support native language development by first teaching literacy in the native 
language.  Native language support is provided through all components of the balanced literacy model.  The dual language 
program hires teachers who are native speakers or native-like speakers of French to reinforce ELLs' mastery of their first 
language.  All French-dominant students, starting in kindergarten, take books home in the native language to read 
independently.  In addition, students struggling with vocabulary development are encouraged to take home books for their 
parents to read aloud in their native language.  The dual language program also incorporates aspects of the French national 
curriculum to challenge advanced French-dominant students in their home language, especially in phonics, spelling, grammar 
and vocabulary.   
  
Our ENL teacher supports native language development by providing access to reading material in students' home languages. 
Our ENL teacher is fluent in Spanish and can provide Spanish-language support to native Spanish-speaking ELLs.  Students also 
have access to materials such as bilingual dictionaries and other home language resources. 
 
Additionally, we have a language workshop specialty teacher who provides French and Spanish foreign language instruction to 
all students in K-2.  Her units of study include language awareness, meeting speakers of other languages, greetings, numbers, 
colors, animals and culture, and her skill focus is on speaking and listening.  She ends the school year with a unit on exposing 
students to other foreign languages that are represented at our school.   
 
In the upper grades, students are encouraged to write in their native language in order to convey concepts and content 
learned.  If it's a language other than Spanish, French or English, ELLs can orally translate the written piece in English and the 
ENL teacher can write in down in English.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All ELLs receive required services and resources that correspond to their age, grade level and proficiency levels.  The ENL 
teacher pushes in to classrooms and works with ELLs of the same age and grade level although their proficiency levels may 
differ.  The French/English dual language program is offered in grades K-5 and French-speaking ELLs are placed in grades that 
correspond to their ages.  Newcomers who are identified as ELLs are also placed in grades that correspond to their ages.  For 
ELL-SWDs, we ensure that materials are differentiated to ensure access to grade-level content and skills.  The ENL teacher 
organizes books and resources by theme/topic.  If a class is studying Native Americans, for example, she provides her students 
with a wide range of literature, materials and realia on the topic.  This ensures that all ELLs have access to grade/age level 
content at their particular English-language proficiency levels.  Beginning in September 2017, P.S. 58K will be using Rules in 
School as a touchstone text for professional development.  One area the staff will be examining is developmental awareness.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are not co-located with any school.   
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our parent coordinator and bilingual assistant principal work with families to help them connect to the French-speaking 
community before school starts.  They also organized personal tours for students and parents, including our ELL families.  Any 
student arriving before school starts is introduced to our parent coordinator and has the opportunity to tour the school with 
his/her family. They are given names of parents or teachers who speak their home language.  They are introduced to their 
teacher and have the opportunity to see their classroom and speak with our ENL teacher.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

  
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

All students, including ELLs, are invited to participate in after school French, Spanish and Arabic classes that are held through 
Carroll Kids, our PTA after school program.   
During the school day, we have a language workshop specialty teacher who provides French and Spanish foreign language 
instruction to all students in K-2.  Her units of study include language awareness, meeting speakers of other languages, 
greetings, numbers, colors, animals and culture, and her skill focus is on speaking and listening.  She ends the school year with 
a unit on exposing students to other foreign languages that are represented at our school.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a) In each dual language class, we carefully balance our English proficient students alongside French 
proficient students to create heterogeneous classes.  In grades K-2, students are taught by one teacher, 
fluent in both English and French. Instruction in the morning takes place in French and instruction in the 
afternoon takes place in English. In grades 3-5 we use a side-by-side model, with students alternating 
days between a French-speaking teacher in one classroom and an English-speaking teacher in the other. 
50% of the instruction is in English and 50% of the instruction is in French for both ELLs and EPs. 
 
b) Each core content area is taught in both languages. However, for ELLs in grades K and 1, literacy is 
taught primary in French for French-dominant students, and primarily in English for English-dominant 
students. 
 
c) In grades K-2, French is the language of instruction in the morning and English in the afternoon. In 
grades 3-5, students alternate days in French and English. 
 
d)  P.S. 58K follows a sequential biliteracy approach to foster native language literacy first.  French 
dominant students learn to read in French first, and English dominant students learn to read in English 
first. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our school is committed to providing ongoing professional development for all teachers and non-pedagogic staff.  A minimum 
of 15% of all professional development for teachers and administrators focuses on ELL-specific topics. For the school's ENL and 
dual language teachers, a minimum of 50% of professional development is ELL-specific. Teachers have many opportunities to 
acquire their ELL-specific professional development hours, including at weekly professional development sessions for the dual 
language program, as well as through NYCDOE and UFT workshops and conferences, and through calendar days at Teachers 
College.  During the school year, our ENL teacher offers workshops to classroom teachers on best practices for ELLs, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

ESL methodologies and scaffolding, guided reading, guided writing and shared writing.  The ENL teacher collaborates with dual 
language teachers to share resources as the units of study are the same in both dual language and general education.  The ENL 
teacher is developing a library of resources and books help teachers infuse multiculturalism into their classrooms and to 
showcase the different cultures and languages represented at our school.  ENL and bilingual teachers also attend additional 
ELL-specific professional development and turnkey the workshops to our staff.  The ENL teacher attends planning meetings 
with the teachers whose classrooms she pushes in to in order to co-plan and to discuss the learning needs of the ENL 
population. The ENL and bilingual teachers are also invited to professional development related to SWDs.   
The ENL and bilingual classroom teachers are members of different vertical teams that meet regularly to analyze student work 
and to discuss how to improve instruction across the content areas.  The ENL teacher is a member of the writing team, and the 
other vertical teams include math, social studies, special education and reading.  Teachers participating in vertical team 
professional development ensure that instruction aligns to the Common Core Learning Standards and accommodates the 
specific learning needs of ELLs.   
Beginning in September 2017, the entire staff, including the ENL and bilingual teachers, will be working with a touchstone text 
- Rules in School - to help them grow as educators in the following areas: engaging academics, effective management, positive 
community and developmental awareness.  As a result, students will be exposed to the same or similar techniques and 
approaches year after year.   
 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
A minimum of 15% of all professional development for teachers and administrators focuses on ELL-specific topics. For the 
school's ENL and dual language teachers, a minimum of 50% of professional development is ELL-specific. Teachers have many 
opportunities to acquire their ELL-specific professional development hours, including at weekly professional 
development sessions for the dual language program, as well as through NYCDOE and UFT workshops and conferences, and 
through calendar days at Teachers College.  During the school year, our ENL teacher offers workshops to classroom teachers 
on best practices for ELLs, ESL methodologies and scaffolding, guided reading, guided writing and shared writing.   
Minutes are taken during grade meetings, vertical team meetings, and planning meetings. An attendance sheet is taken for the 
Professional Development meetings that teachers attend as well. This ensures that records are maintained.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL and dual language teachers meet with parents of ELLs during parent engagement time on Wednesday 
mornings.  During these meetings, student well-being, academic achievement and language development are 
discussed.  Teachers offer support to parents by suggesting techniques, approaches and resources to help students grow 
emotionally and academically outside of school.  In the fall, the ENL teacher invites parents to meet with her to discuss the 
results of the NYSESLAT.  In the spring, the ENL teacher offers NYSESLAT workshops to parents to give them more information 
about the assessment. Bilingual staff provide translation services as needed in Spanish, French and Arabic.  We also have 
Polish, Russian and Hebrew speakers on staff.  The DOE translation hotline is also utilized as needed.   
The ENL teacher is in the process of creating a blog/website in order to share with parents resources pertaining to the 
NYSESLAT and ELL instruction.  

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our parent coordinator also acts as our language access coordinator.  In that role, she maintains language access resources, 
such the language access coordinator kit provided by the NYCDOE.  Parental involvement and community building are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

recognized as essential ingredients for student success.  Our PTA is very active and involved in our school and it holds 
numerous events throughout the school year, including our annual multicultural celebration and the French-language book 
fair.  Our school offers many ways for parents of ELLs to get involved. As part of our Title III after-school program, ELL families 
are invited an end of the school year celebration.  Because both the K-2 and 3-5 programs focus on storytelling, ELLs and their 
parents work together to create a puppet or a character from a folktale from their home countries.  Workshops on topics such 
as "Supporting Your Language Learner at Home" are offered to ELL parents as well as information sessions about the 
NYSESLAT and state testing. Parents are often invited into classrooms to share a part of their family/country's culture and to 
celebrate writing publications and end-of-unit projects.  Many parents in the dual language program volunteer as class parents 
and work with the PTA.  Our multilingual staff provides translation and interpretation services.  For students who speak a 
language we do not have a translator for, we use the NYCDOE  translation services. 
Our guidance counselor provides workshops for parents and students to help them transition to middle school.  She attends 
regular NYCDOE middle school liaison meetings, which provide her with training to support diverse student needs, including 
ELLs.  Our parent coordinator gives workshops for parents and, together with the 5th grade teachers, assists them in finding 
the best possible middle school match for their child. We also have visits from returning graduates to talk to students about 
their experiences at their new schools.  Translation services are provided as needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Katherine Dellostritto, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
