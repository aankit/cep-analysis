Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of P.S.52 is to continue to develop reflective, assessment capable learners. P.S. 52 has the highest 
expectations and performance standards for all students. With the help of our parents, we are able to strengthen 
communications between home and school to benefit the educational process. This will empower students to gain 
the knowledge, skills and mindset needed to successfully contribute to, compete in, and shape a 21st Century global 
society that values equity, excellence, and empathy. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 52, The John C. Thompson School, is an elementary school located on Staten Island with 580 students from pre-
kindergarten through fifth grade.  The school population is comprised of 2% Black, 21% Hispanic, 63% White and 12% 
Asian students. Boys account for 47.3% of the students enrolled and girls account for 52.7%. The average student 
attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 95%. Our student body includes 19% English Language Learners, 
and 20% Students with Special Needs. 

Our school focuses on a positive learning environment where all staff and students participate in a whole school 
initiative to raise student achievement by maximizing student engagement. We work to ensure that all students are 
intellectually engaged in challenging content through well-designed learning tasks and activities that require complex 
thinking by students. Our teachers are supported and evaluated through the use of the Danielson Framework and 
receive timely feedback from administration. Impact teams meet regularly to look at student work, share best 
practices, and refine curriculum based on the data collected to improve teacher practice in all classrooms and raise 
student achievement. Teachers on vertical teams participate in classroom inter-visitations to observe best practices 
that will help assist them in improving their classroom instruction to maximize all students access and be able to 
achieve more academic success.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

At PS 52 we have 19% ENL students and 20% students with disabilities. The practice of planning and delivering 
thoughtfully planned instruction based upon all the data we possess supports our community’s belief that all children 
can learn and that it is our responsibility as professionals to make instructional changes in design for learning that 
incorporate the needs of all students.  

According to the most recent RLAT we have ninety eight current ELL students and twenty three former ELLs. The 
home languages represented in our school include Albanian, Arabic, Cantonese, Gujarati, Italian, Mandarin, Pashto, 
Polish, Russian, Spanish, Turkish and Urdu. Based on the NYSITELL for new admits or NYSESLAT from 2018, the data by 
grade and proficiency level is as follows; Kindergarten consists of students of the following proficiency levels; two 
Entering, six Emerging, two transitioning and four Expanding. First grade consists of students of the following 
proficiency levels; two Entering, one Emerging, four Transitioning, eighteen Expanding, and three Commanding. In 
second grade, one student scored at the Entering level, five students scored at the Emerging level, eight at the 
Transitioning level, eight at the Expanding level and one scored Commanding. In third grade, one student scored at 
both the Entering and the Emerging level, four at the Transitioning level, twelve at the Expanding level and six scored 
Commanding. In fourth grade one student scored at the Emerging level, two at the Transitioning level, five at the 
expanding level and sixteen students are at the Commanding level. Of our fifth grade ELLs one scored the Emerging 
level, three at the Transitioning level, six scored at the Expanding level and two students are at the Commanding level.  

According to the Special Education Student Information System (SESIS), we currently have 20%of students receiving 
special education services. Kindergarten consist of ten students in an ICT setting and four students receiving SETSS. 
First grade consist of nine students in an ICT setting, ten students in a self contained class and two students receiving 
SETSS. Second grade consists of six students in a self contained class and six students receiving SETSS. Third grade 
consist of ten students in an ICT setting, one student in a self contained class and two students receiving SETSS. 
Fourth grade consists eight students in an ICT setting, four in a self contained class and seven students receiving 
SETSS. Fifth Grade consists of eleven students in an ICT setting and four students receiving SETSS. 

Teachers plan and revise lesson plans to provide multiple entry points, supports and scaffolds for all students. Lessons 
provide multiple opportunities for student discussion and sharing of learning during whole group and small group

instruction. Routines and expectations are firmly embedded. Instructional practices that promote high levels of 
student thinking and participation include differentiation in all lessons. Universal Design for Learning has been infused 
in our unit plans to ensure that the needs of all students can be met.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Two areas of celebration in which we’ve made substantial progress are with collaborative teaching and strong family 
ties. Structures and systems are in place to consistently communicate high expectations to staff and provide feedback 
to set meaningful partnerships with families around supporting students towards expectations connected to college 
and career readiness. As reflected in our Quality Review (QR) report, "Teacher Impact teams, comprised of teacher 
leaders, seek evidence of proficient school practices through school wide inter-visitations relative to the Danielson 
Framework for Teaching. Feedback from team visits is provided to individual teachers and informs school wide 
professional development.” Strong Family-Community Ties is also reflected in our Quality Review. “Family workshops, 
grade newsletters, resources provided by the school, parent English as a Second Language classes, and progress 
reports indicate student goals, all provide multiple means of feedback and an awareness of practices towards 
preparing students for college and career.” Thus, this school wide system of mutual accountability and effective 
partnerships with families are resulting in meeting expectations in teaching and learning literacy. 

Based on the Framework for Great School’s element regarding Rigorous Instruction, which is a component that is 
continuously changing with areas for improvement. Our instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year will be 
centered around delivering Rigorous Instruction and fostering student capable learners. As reflected in our most 
recent QR report, “In several classrooms, teachers engaged students in challenging work which required reasoning 
and thought, however, this rigorous instruction is not seen in all classrooms and supports may be limited and students 
are not challenged. “ We will continue to adapt the literacy program, Journeys, as well as adapt a the Math program, 
Eureka Math, in which grade teams will collaborate to refine and align our literacy and math curriculum to the

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the Principal's 2017-2018 PPO, the 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot and our most recent Quality 
Review in 2014-2015, 1.1 Rigorous Instruction and 1.2 Pedagogy were rated areas of celebration. Over the last, we 
have continued to place an emphasis on formative assessment practices as well as increasing student led practices. 
Teachers and students have been considering the types of questions to ask that would elevate the level of dialogue in 
classrooms. Structures and routines developed over the past few years have supported partner talk, small group, 
Socratic Seminar and whole group conversations as well as self and peer assessment. Teachers have been working 
towards having students lead whole group conversations, posing their own questions and commenting on each 
others’ ideas. As a continuation of this work, we wanted to have students take the lead with their own learning, 
including student self-reflection, self and peer assessment and student led conferences in grades 2, 3, 4 & 5.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, as a result off all teachers embedding rigorous habits across grade curriculum that will promote college 
and career readiness for all students with a 5% gain in students scoring a Level 3 and 4 as measured by the NYS ELA & 
Math Assessments.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Families are informed of student progress, in writing, by individual goal letters in all subjects, TCRWP Parent Letters, 
monthly grade newsletters including students’ own reflections and/or goals, Eureka Math unit test scores, Raz Kids, 
Progress Reports for IEP/Related Service students and report cards. 

Supports to achieve these expectations are infused in the school culture as well. For example, our Parent Coordinator 
is responsive to all questions parents have regarding their children’s academic progress and school policies, during 
lunchtime presentations. Students are consistently informed of the criteria for their various incentives and how they 
can help themselves to achieve them. The parent coordinator oversees the implementation of all Parent Engagement 
activities.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the most recent NYS ELA assessment (Spring 2018), we had an increase of 8.3% in the number of 
students who achieved a Level 3 or 4 in ELA and an increase of 3.2% in Math. Although these results were above the 
city’s average increase in each area, we need to continue to raise student achievement. Therefore, an increase of the 
number of students who achieve Level 3 and 4 in ELA & Math will be one of our school goals by using the inquiry 
model to impact student achievement. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teachers will engage in inquiry based Impact Teams, structured professional collaborations in order to 
strengthen school wide instructional capacity and promote college and career readiness for all students that will result 
in a 5% gain in students scoring a Level 3 and 4 on the NYS ELA & Math Assessments to further our work and focus on 
closing the achievement gap .

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Evidence Walks: Teachers will work in vertical teams to inter-visit 
colleagues’ rooms on different grades to observe best practices 
around the different QR indicators and/or Danielson Framework 
components. Teachers will then engage in sharing their learning 
in weekly PDs. Teachers are asked to observe classroom 
practices and share presentations to celebrate best practices and 
improve teacher practice as evidenced by Danielson data. 

Inquiry Impact Teacher Team work: To identify needs of all 
students by looking at student data and revising curriculum to 
impact student achievement as measured by end unit 
assessments and Performance Based Assessments.  

Curriculum Revisions: continue to develop CCLS aligned unit 
plans that reflect the CCLS Instructional Shifts and receive 
meaningful feedback for improvement and to ensure that 
scaffolds and UDL components are embedded in the curriculum. 
Through the inquiry process curriculum revisions are made to 
meet the needs of all students. 

Common Preps for Planning: Common preps are given to foster 
common grade wide planning and cohesiveness to provide 
rigorous instruction

improve their achievement level in Literacy and Mathematics and to deepen their understanding of Rigorous 
Instruction. 

Supports to achieve these expectations are infused in the school culture as well. For example, families are informed of 
student progress, in writing, by individual goal letters in all subjects, TCRWP Parent Letters, monthly grade 
newsletters including students’ own reflections and/or goals, Eureka Math unit test scores, Raz Kids, Progress Reports 
for IEP/Related Service students and report cards.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As indicated on the Elementary School Quality Snapshot and The NYC School Survey 2016-2017 Report, 96% of 
parents are satisfied with the education that their child has received. However, a school wide initiative during the 
2018-2019 school year is to continue to increase teacher and parent trust by hosting grade specific ongoing Common 
Core Curriculum Conferences. These workshops were held every Tuesday during Parent Engagement Time. However, 
parent participation was not satisfactory. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2018, we will increase parental engagement by 5% by inviting parents into classrooms to engage in a CCLS 
aligned academic task and to attend the CCLS Parent Workshops that are available every Tuesday, as measured by 
parent workshop attendance, Common Core Curriculum Conferences, and The Learning Environment Survey.

via a partnership with the Jewish Community Center of Staten island. The program is designed to help immigrants 
learn and improve their English language skills. The focus is to facilitate conversational English, reading and writing in 
order for parents to find employment, make promotional gains and increase involvement in their children’s 
education. We will also engage parents by holding an information session to familiarize them with the home 
connection reports that will be sent home, once their child begins utilizing the Imagine Learning program.

Supporting Students in Temporary Housing (STH) 
As included in your Office of School and Youth Development Consolidated Plan STH Section and in accordance with the 
federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act and Chancellor's Regulation A-780, schools must identify, serve, and 
report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

 

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.)

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

Programs are offered to students and parents in violence prevention, child abuse, health and nutrition, fire 
prevention, and dental health. These programs are typically presented by outside agencies. Our guidance counselor 
works with groups of children to address issues such as; working together, conflict resolution, suicide threats, etc 
which often leads to referrals to resources within our community. Additionally, PS 52 uses funds top provide students 
in temporary housing with uniforms as well as school supplies and other academic at risk services.

intervention services, etc.). 
Every spring we invite our neighborhood CBO to bring their pre- school students and their parents to our school to see 
our kindergarten program. We also have a kindergarten orientation in June for new incoming students and parents. 
During this time members of our administration, teachers and parent coordinator present our school vision, mission, 
academic programs and many of our extra-curricular programs.  

In addition we are in a partnership with SIUH North Early Direction Childhood Center. A resident will visit our special 
education classes to for an afternoon. The purpose is to observe and learn more about the special education 
opportunities your school provides for your students. This is helpful so the resident is knowledgeable in giving options 
for the Pre-k families transitioning to Kindergarten. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The administration, coaches and teachers have formed a MOSL Team that selects assessments for evaluative 
purposes for our school’s teaching staff. Additionally, they meet monthly to reflect on the assessments we are using 
and to make any changes or adjustments to them. The school has a Professional Development Team comprised of 
teachers, paraprofessionals and administration. They decide on the professional development plan for the school for 
the current year.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. John C. Thompson, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

John C. Thompson will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of P.S. 52's School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA;

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;  

 

P.S. 52 will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

Our ninety- eight current English Language Learners (ELLs) will be invited to attend one of two 
Title III Morning Academy Programs that will take place over a seventeen week 
period.  Sessions will be held on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 7:00 to 8:00 am, beginning 
November 28, 2018 through April 4, 2019. These programs will be staffed by two teachers, one a 
TESOL licensed ENL teacher, and the other a general education classroom teacher who holds a 
common branch license.  All instruction will be delivered in English.  Letters inviting students to 
these programs are sent home in English and the student’s native language, whenever possible, 
via the Translation and Interpretations Unit’s document translation services.  Additionally 
parents will be notified/ reminded of their child’s opportunity to attend these programs using 
class Dojo, during PTA meetings, Parent Teacher Conferences, and during Parent Engagement 
times.  We utilize bilingual support staff to aid in communicating with families at these times if 
possible, and if not we employ the Translation and Interpretation Unit’s phone interpretation 
services. On Wednesdays, students in grades K and 1 will attend; on Thursdays will have ELLs 
in grades 2-5.  We will group students based on data obtained from the NYSITELL, 
NYSESLAT, EDAT Estimator Tool, Formative and Summative classroom assessments. Each 
day we anticipate grouping students by language proficiency and grade level. According to the 
most recent RLAT we have thirty-nine current ELL students, and three former ELLs in grades K 
and 1.  Kindergarten consists of students of the following proficiency levels; two Entering, six 
Emerging, two transitioning and four Expanding based on the NYSITELL. First grade consists 
of students of the following proficiency levels; two Entering, one Emerging, four Transitioning, 
eighteen Expanding, and three Commanding based on the 2018 NYSESLAT or NYSITELL for 
new admits.   In grades 2-5 we have 59 current ELL students and twenty seven former ELLs. In 
second grade, one student scored at the Entering level, five students scored at the Emerging 
level, eight at the Transitioning level, eight at the Expanding level and one scored commanding 
on the 2018 NYSESLAT or NYSITELL for new admits. In third grade, one student scored at 
both the Entering and the Emerging level, four at the Transitioning level, twelve at the 
Expanding level and six scored commanding on the 2018 NYSESLAT or NYSITELL for new 
admits.  In fourth grade one student scored at the Emerging level, two at the Transitioning level, 
five at the expanding level and sixteen students are at the Commanding level and receiving 
former ELL services for the 2018-2019 school year.  Of our fifth grade ELLs one scored the 
Emerging level, three at the Transitioning level,  six scored at the Expanding level and two 
students are at the Commanding level and will be receiving former ELL services for the 2018-
2019 school year.   Eligible ELLs will have first priority to attend this program, and fortunately 
we have been able to include former ELLs as well.  Each day one group will consist of our 
newcomers, students who scored at the Entering, Emerging or Transitioning level on the 
NYSESLAT or NYSITELL, SWDs, and other at-risk students.  The other group will be 
comprised of students who scored at the Expanding or Commanding levels.  Depending on 
enrollment we anticipate both teachers working side by side following an ICT (Integrated Co-
Teaching) model and differentiating tasks within each group.  If however, we have too many 
participants to facilitate this in one classroom, the Common Branch and ENL teacher will rotate, 
respectively spending 30 minutes with each group.Our Title III Morning Academy will include a

technology component, therefore we have allocated a portion of funding to purchase 10 ipads to 
use with our students, and a Smartboard for the ENL/ Title III classroom.   We plan on utilizing 
the Imagine Learning program and Raz-Plus.  Imagine Learning is a language and literacy 
software program which offers engaging, differentiated content, first language support, and is 
Common Core aligned.  Instruction is catered to each student’s unique literacy needs, delivering 
instruction at their level to increase phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and 
comprehension.  There is ongoing assessment, and data obtained will be used to drive 
instruction.  Home connection reports will also be sent to families in their native language to 
communicate further with parents about their child’s progress.  Raz-Plus delivers a personalized 
approach to literacy.  It is a blended learning platform that provides effective teacher led 
instruction, developmentally appropriate reading practice, formative assessment, and data-driven 
reporting.  It provides leveled books, and other resources in printable, projectable and digital 
formats.  These materials are supplemental and distinct from those used for daily instruction. Our 
program will also include a thematic unit on Immigrant Experiences: Past and Present.  We 
intend to launch this aspect of the program with a “Celebration of Cultures” Family Literacy 
Night.  Incorporating thematic instruction enables all ELL students to participate in active 
learning.  Differentiation, hands on activities, and models will be provided to all ELL 
students.  Our rationale for using a thematic unit is that our ELLs need support in Math, science 
and social studies in addition to literacy.  Vocabulary is repeated naturally as it occurs in 
different content area studies, and it demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of learning.  We 
chose the theme of immigration as it contains curriculum that can be connected to students’ lives, 
either personally or via members of their families. The culminating activity of this program will 
be a field trip to the Ellis Island Immigration Museum for students in grades 3-5.       We plan on 
using Title III funding to purchase a license for access to Raz-Plus for one teacher. We are also 
purchasing Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT Grades K-5 Published by Attanasio 
Associates.  Additionally we will use Title III funds to facilitate a field trip to the Ellis Island 
Immigration Museum for forty students, two teachers and four parents.     The ENL designee, 
Diana Puma, will maintain all records in her classroom for this program including student 
attendance, and invitations letters, which we send home in English and the students' home 
language whenever possible.  We facilitate translating program notification letters through the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit's services and through utilizing our bilingual staff members.

towards meeting standards and they will understand a whole school initiative to raise student 
achievement by maximizing student engagement.  We will work to ensure that all students are

intellectually engaged with challenging yet accessible content through well designed learning 
tasks and activities that require complex thinking by students.  All staff members use formative 
assessments to monitor student progress towards meeting standards to understand their students 
well, meet them where they are, and provide appropriate scaffolds to maximize student 
achievement.  Imbedded within our comprehensive professional development plan we have 
several ELL specific topics, geared towards teachers and staff who work with ELLs to support 
their learning and increase their English language proficiency.  We conduct ELL specific 
professional development study groups in working in our grade level impact teams we will use 
the Case Study Protocol.  All teachers and staff will be trained on the Case Study protocol by the 
Instructional Coach, Ann Marie Palmeri, to be in line with the district wide focus. We will also 
continue to support the school staff to utilize resources provided via the Office of English 
Language Learners.  Topics that follow are included in the PD plan for 2018-2019 on the

Instructional Supports for English Language Learners, to aid general education teachers in 
designing effective content area instruction using research based strategies, instructional 
guidelines and resources for helping ELLs succeed. This professional development will be 
conducted on June 6, 2019 in two separate sessions. Session 1 will be held from 8:00-11:00 and 
Session 2 11:50-2:50.  Additionally teachers of ELLs will attend various professional 
development offerings as they become available through the SIBFSC (Staten Island Borough 
Field Support Center). The professional development trainings that were attended last  year were 
Targets of Measurement, Proficiency Level Descriptions, NYSESLAT Training, Appropriate 
Evaluations/Assessments for Cultural Linguistic Needs and Representation, Nuts and Bolts:

Our school coordinates annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the 
program, their child’s language development progress, the results of language proficiency 
assessments (NYSESLAT and NYSITELL), and the student’s language development needs in all 
content areas.  These meetings take place on Tuesday afternoons during parent engagement time, 
and are ongoing throughout the school year.  This is in addition to the DOE scheduled parent 
teacher conferences and the mandated parent orientation meetings.  Attendees will include the 
child’s classroom teacher, ENL teacher, related service providers and a parent or guardian.  We

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
will utilize bilingual staff members  for interpretation for Russian, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and 
Albanian families when requested.  For all interpretation in a language other than those 
mentioned above, we use the Department of Education’s Translation and Interpretation Unit’s 
Over-the-Phone Interpretation Services.  Parents are invited to these meetings which may take 
place either in person or over the phone, via appropriately translated letters. Parents are given 
several choices of dates and times, so that everyone can be accommodated. Copies of these 
letters as well as documentation of these meetings are maintained by the ENL 
teacher.     Diana Puma and Daniel Castro will be presenting a parent workshop on December 11, 
2018 at 2:30, outlining the ENL curriculum. 
In order to involve and engage parents in the academic success of their children we plan various 
activities, many which are specifically targeted to parents of ELLs.  Parents of ELLs are offered 
free adult ENL classes.  These classes are taught via a partnership with the Jewish Community 
Center of Staten island. The program is designed to help immigrants learn and improve their 
English language skills. The focus is to facilitate conversational English, reading and writing in 
order for parents to find employment, make promotional gains and increase involvement in their 
children’s education.  We will also engage parents by holding an information session to 
familiarize them with the home connection reports that will be sent home, once their child begins 
utilizing the Imagine Learning program. Various parent workshops are also offered to parents of 
ELL students, where literacy and language building strategies that can be used at home are 
shared.   We will have bilingual support staff on hand to facilitate discourse and assist parents in 
asking any questions they may have about the material presented.   Diana Puma and Daniel 
Castro will be presenting a parent workshop on December 11, 2018 at 2:30, outlining the ENL 
curriculum.  Additionally, all families are invited to monthly parental engagement activities in 
the classroom where they have the opportunity to view their child’s work, and participate in a 
variety of learning activities. Some topics include ; Navigating Raz-Kids 10/9/18 at 
2:30,  individual grade's Curriculum Workshops, being held every Tuesday from 10/16/18 
through 11/27/18, 1/15/18 through 2/26/18, and 3/5/18 through 4/16/18 at 2:30.  Other notable 
parent engagement workshops include Supporting Your Child's Language Development, which 
will take place on 12/4/18 and May 7, 2019.  As part of our Title III parent engagement 
component, we hold an annual family literacy night, where ELLs and their families are invited to 
participate in literacy and art activities.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
    Formative assessments being used to guide instructional planning for ELLs include teacher observations (ongoing 
assessments), entrance and exit slips (curriculum based and standards driven), checklists including success criteria which 
promotes a basis for student self-assessments and peer assessments for each lesson. Students are provided with discussion 
rubrics to help guide and support the progression of progress within the connecting skill and discussion standards. These 
procedures are conducted by teachers during the learning process in order to modify teaching and learning activities to 
improve student achievement.School wide formative assessments also include Fundations Unit Assessments in grades K-2, 
Journeys Skills in Context (K-5), Math Eureka Mid Module Assessments/Exit tickets for each lesson and Portland Writing Exit 
Tickets (K-5). All assessments are aligned to the task/lesson taught along with the correlating standards. The data that is 
collected from all formative assessments are used to structure small groups for ELLs and is also used to track of meeting

language and academic goals.According to current data our ELLs scored below standards on the following skills:Compare and 
ContrastCause and EffectStory Structure 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

To support the use of formative assessments through our curriculum and standards based instruction teachers meet in grade 
teams (Impact Teams/common preps three a week) to plan lessons and ongoing assessments to monitor student 
progress.  Each team is supported by the instructional coach to create standards based checklists for peer and self 
assessments. During grade team meetings,  lessons are created to meet the focus standards for each unit. Periodically, the 
instructional staff meets in designated Impact teams to further  analyze the data obtained from these assessments to allocate 
trends and track student progress in order to adapt future instruction. By utilizing these structures, the ongoing focus for our 
ELLs is provide best practices through the Core Collaborative framework while strengthen language levels through discussion 
and content based tasks. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Summative assessments, which are cumulative evaluations used to measure student growth after instruction are unlike 
formative assessments, which are designed to provide the immediate, explicit feedback useful for helping teacher and student 
during the learning process. High quality summative information helps shape how our teachers organize their 
curricula.  Summative assessments or baseline benchmark assessments we use in all grades to identify baselines, progress, and 
areas of need include, the Journeys’ Skills in Context, Journeys’ Unit benchmarks/ baseline unit assessments, Teachers College 
Reading Writing Project assessments, and Eureka Math mid and end of module assessments.  Additionally students in grades 
three through five participate in Rally periodic assessments in ELA and Math. Students in grade K-5 are administered the 
Scanton Performance Series in ELA and Math to identify ability level and track progress. Scantron Performance series takes 
place in the Fall, Winter and Spring (3 times per year). NYSED state exams in ELA and Math, and Science in fourth grade.  All 
ELL students are administered the NYSESLAT each Spring.  These summative assessments help teachers and support staff 
gauge student learning relative to the particular content standards.  Some areas of need we have identified based on the 
assessments mentioned are detailed below;  seven students who took the NYSESLAT and regressed one proficiency level from 
their score in 2016, the grades of the students are as follows; in second grade, four students and fourth grade, four students. 
Additionally, fourteen NYSESLAT takers remained at the same proficiency level for two or more years, six in second grade, 
three in third grade, and five in fifth grade.  Furthermore, other areas of concern for our ELL students include students 
achieving a level one or two on either the NYSED ELA or Math assessments.  In fourth grade ten students scored at a level 1 or 
2 on the ELA, seven scored at a level 1 or 2 on the Math; in fifth grade six students scored at a level 1 or 2 in ELA and eight 
scored at a level 1 or 2 in Math.        
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The results of all previously mentioned assessments are available on School Net. Impact teams meet weekly to analyze student 
work and data from these assessments to collaboratively plan to meet students’ needs. Also, our Data Specialist provides 
teachers with detailed standard based reports, to assess students’ strengths and weaknesses in order to differentiate 
instruction and provide UDL scaffolds when needed.  We utilize UDL guidelines to provide multiple means of representation to 
help create resourceful, knowledgeable learners.  Some examples include activating or supplying background knowledge; 
highlighting patterns, big ideas, critical features and relationships; maximizing transfer and generalization; guiding information 
processing, visualization, and manipulation; clarifying vocabulary and symbols; clarifying syntax and structure; supporting 
decoding text, mathematical notation and symbols; promoting understanding across languages; illustrations through multiple 
media; offering ways of customizing the display of information; and offering alternatives for auditory or visual 
information.  We provide UDL scaffolds for action and expression to encourage strategic, goal directed learners.  Some 
strategies include, guiding appropriate goal setting; supporting planning and strategy development; facilitation of managing 
information and resources; enhancing students capacity for monitoring for progress; using multiple media for communication; 
using multiple tools for construction and composition; building fluencies with graduating levels of support for practice and 
performance; and  allowing for varying methods for response and navigation.

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
All ELL students receive instruction in English language development provided at the Tier I instructional level.  This 
incorporates high quality, evidence based instruction that has been shown to be effective for ELLs, and differentiation to meet 
students’ diverse needs.  If a student demonstrates a need for more intensive support, they move into Tiers II and III.  We 
obtain initial data through a screening process that involves administering the NYSITELL exam to students eligible,  based on 
their HLIS and interview process.  We continue to monitor students grade level benchmarks via data obtained from TCWRP 
assessments, as well as state exam results. Additionally, for each English language learner who scores below specified levels of 
performance on these assessments, the school then determines other support services to provide the student.  We take into 
consideration the number of years of instruction in the English as a New Language program, the students’ English and home 
language literacy, Content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with inconsistent/interrupted formal education 
(SIFE), content area teacher recommendation, and/ or parent or guardian request.  We use this data to identify which tier of 
instructional support a student falls into.  Students move into Tier 2 or Tier 3 if they demonstrate a need for more targeted and 
intensive academic support.  This extra support can occur in the classroom, but also in separate settings with instruction 
focused on specific learning targets.  Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction is also tailored to meet ELL’s language needs while 
incorporating research-based intervention strategies.  Our RTI model is designed to determine whether students are 
benefiting from an instructional program within a reasonable time, build more effective instructional programs for students 
who are not benefiting, compare the efficacy of different forms of instruction, design more effective, individualized 
instructional programs, reduce inappropriate referral rate and increase educational opportunities for linguistically and 
culturally diverse populations. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
In order to evaluate and inform our ELL program, we use the data obtained from the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA, NYS Math and 
Science assessments.  The data obtained from 2017’s assessments is as follows; Seventy-three students took the 2017 
NYSESLAT, ten of which (13.7%) scored at the commanding level, and one scored at the expanding level and a level 3 on the 
ELA, these students have now exited ELL status, and thus are entitled to receive two years of former ELL services, which 
include 90 minutes per week of English as a New Language, and two years of accommodations on assessments. Of the eighty-
eight  current ELL students who took the NYSESLAT last year, or the NYSITELL for new admits, forty one (46%) scored at the 
Commanding level, twenty five (28%) scored at the Transitioning level, fourteen (16%) scored at the Emerging level, and eight 
(9%) scored at the Entering level.   Breaking down the results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT by grade reveals the following: Of 
our twenty four kindergarten students, 5 students (20%) scored at the Entering level, 4 (16%) scored at the Emerging level, 5 
(20%) scored at the Transitioning level and 10 (41%) students scored at the Expanding level.  Of our nineteen first graders, 6 
students (32%) scored at the Emerging level, 2 (10%) scored at the Transitioning level, and 11 (58%) scored at the Expanding 
level.  Of our seventeen second graders, 2 students (11%) scored at the Entering level, 1 (6%) scored at the Emerging level, and 
7 (41%) students scored at both the Transitioning and Expanding levels.  In third grade, we have nine students, 2 of which 
(22%) scored at the Emerging level, 4 (44%) scored at the Transitioning level and 3(33%) scored at the Expanding level.   Of our 
eleven fourth grade students, 1 (9%) scored at both the Entering and Emerging levels, 5 (45%) scored at the Transitioning level, 
and 4 (36%) scored at the Expanding level.  In fifth grade, of our eight ELL students, 3 (38%) scored at the Transitioning level 
and 5 (62%) scored at the Expanding level.  Last year, ten of our third grade ELLs took the NYS ELA, 5 (50%) scored at both 
levels 1 and 2.    Seven fourth grade students took the NYS ELA, 2 (29%) scoring at level one and 5 (71%) scored at level 2.  Of 
the ten third grade ELL students who took the NYS Math assessment last year, 3 (30%) scored at both levels 1 and 3, 4 (40%) 
scored at a level 3.  In fourth grade, seven students took the NYS Math Assessment, 3 (42%) scored at level 1, and 4 (57%) 
scored at level 2.  Of the eight fourth grade students who took the NYS Science assessment last year, one student (12%) scored 
at a both level 1 and 2, 4 students (50%) scored at a level 3 and 2 students (25%) scored at a level 4.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We have various structures in place in order to disseminate the above data, so that we can to make adjustments to our ELL 
programs.  The school leadership ensures that the ENL teachers have the results of the NYSESLAT by providing them with 
NYSED Tested/ Not Tested Confirmation reports for each grade which gives student details including ELL eligibility, duration of 
services, and NYSESLAT score and Standard Achieved.  Additionally, ENL teachers have access to and have been trained in ATS

so that they can access students enrollment, and standardized test histories.   School  leadership and staff routinely examine 
these results, and the data obtained from the EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool) to identify trends. Some trends we discovered 
include the majority of first grade students scoring high in the reading modality on the Kindergarten NYSESLAT (2017).  Also we 
have found that second grade NYSESLAT takers (current third grade) had the most students achieve Proficiency (7 of 17 or 
41%).  The NYSESLAT data is shared with all staff in September; classroom teachers receive not only their students overall 
proficiency levels, but also their raw scores in each modality.  The ENL teachers distribute a chart with “Can Do” descriptors for 
each proficiency level and modality to aid them in grouping and planning.  Similarly we use NYSITELL data to inform our 
instruction, by  looking at the breakdown of scores to understand a particular student's strengths or needs.  For level one 
NYSITELL takers we can view their listening and speaking scores , for higher levels students also have a reading and writing 
score.  We use this information to inform instruction, form groups, and identify students for tutoring.  Our school has several 
teams in place that meet on a monthly basis, and work collaboratively to inform our program.  The Data Team, which is 
comprised of a teacher from each grade, the school’s Data Specialist, and our Instructional Coach, analyze the data obtained 
from these assessments, look for trends, and discuss best practices that can ensure all students’ mastery of standards.  Their 
findings are communicated to the Instructional Team, which is tasked with choosing curriculum and programs that can best 
meet students’ needs. The School Leadership team, which includes the Principal, special and general education teachers, and 
parents, evaluate these recommendations in order to develop school-based educational policies, and ensure that resources 
are aligned to implement those policies.  Teacher impact teams analyze the following questions to develop a school wide 
understanding of student misconceptions; Where are students now?, Where do they need to go? and How can we get them 
there? They continuously review student work, Focus Standard tasks, exit slips, formative and summative data to adjust the 
learning and instructional gaps that are revealed.  The data specialist, helps facilitate the analysis of how students in the 
current 4th and 5th grade performed on each standard and question on last year’s NYC ELA and Math exams, by examining the 
2017 Item Skills Analysis.Our findings are as follows for third grade ELA;  For the Reading Standard, Informational Text:

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In accordance with The Practitioners’ Work Group for Accelerating English Language Learner Student Achievement: 
Nine Common Features of Successful Programs for ELLs, our school ensures that curriculum and instruction are closely 
aligned to the language standards and The Next Generation Learning Standards. We continuously and closely monitor 
ELL student progress so we can adjust instructional planning based on data obtained through formal and informal 
assessments.  Teachers present all learning tasks with multiple entry points so that all students can grasp instruction 
regardless of language proficiency and academic level. Various supporting materials (manipulatives, checklist and

rubrics) are created by teacher teams and utilized in every lesson. These include the teacher created ELL scaffolds 
which have been included on our curriculum maps for our reading program, Journeys.  The Journeys program contains 
digital tools and results-driven instruction. It is a K-6 reading program with rigorous instructional designed meeting 
the current standards. We implement a school wide close reading routine to  build better readers while also providing 
intervention for struggling students. Every student has a close reading checklist on their desk to refer to.  Additionally 
the Eureka Math program provides ELL scaffolds using the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework.  UDL 
guides the development of instructional features that can provide ELLs enhanced access to a variety of grade-level 
curricula.        Two full-time dually certified TESOL and Common Branch licensed teacher services students in 50 
minute blocks. We utilize a blended Stand Alone and Integrated ENL model. As per CR Part-154.2 students at the 
Entering and Emerging Level receive 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL, and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL; students at 
the Transitioning and Expanding level receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL; and students who score at the 
commanding level on the NYSESLAT receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL instruction for two years. Students are 
grouped together by grade and/or English proficiency level designated by the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL when 
applicable.  At times,  students are scheduled within heterogeneously groups with mixed proficiency levels on the 
same grade level. As they are receiving services at the same time. Students are also scheduled within homogenous 
groups of the same grade and proficiency level.  ENL methodologies such as Whole Language, Cooperative Learning, 
and Total Physical Response are utilized daily. Scaffolds and supported materials are used in every lesson as language 
is taught core curriculum content. At our school, Teachers support and learn from each other in an atmosphere that 
recognizes the interdependency of language proficiency and content instruction.  School organization and structure is 
maximized for ample collaboration and planning time among teachers, and school leadership.  The ENL teachers 
attends impact meets and grade team meeting with classroom and cluster teachers.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The ENL teachers are responsible for ensuring that the students are receiving the mandated number of instructional minutes 
according to their English language proficiency level.  As per CR Part 154-2, students scoring at the Entering and Emerging 
(formerly beginning and low intermediate) levels according to the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT will receive 360 minutes, or two 
units of ENL instruction per week, 180 of which will be Stand-Alone, and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL instruction.  Students 
who achieve a designation of Transitioning and Expanding (formerly Intermediate and Advanced) will receive 180 minutes, or 
one unit of Integrated ENL instruction per week.  Additionally students scoring at the Commanding (formerly proficient) level 
will receive 90 minutes, or one half unit of Integrated ENL instruction per week for two years. When scheduling allows, 
Integrated ENL instruction takes place in the students’ classroom utilizing a co-teaching model of instruction. Both ENL 
teachers are dually certified in both TESOL and Common Branches. An administrator will approve and monitor the ENL 
schedule for the duration of the school year.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Although all instruction is conducted in English, students are provided with native language supports whenever possible.  This 
is accomplished in many ways including but not limited to native language translations for exams, interpretation services, the 
use of L1 to English glossaries and dictionaries and Google Translate. All ENL and classroom instruction is common core 
aligned. The ENL teacher follows grade level Journeys vertical maps when planning instruction.  The ENL teacher provides 
content area support for ELLs by rephrasing and reframing tasks, using graphic organizers to provide students with a visual 
framework for understanding, using domain specific sentence frames, and directly teaching academic vocabulary. ENL 
students work towards language objectives to support them in achieving content objectives. Our staff follows 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

several principles in order to guide teachers, ELL specialists, curriculum planners and administrators as they work together to 
develop methods and materials to help ELLs meet the CCSS. We regard ELL's native language(s) as assets, and use them in 
bridging prior knowledge to new knowledge, and in making content meaningful and comprehensible.  Classroom practice 
facilitates the development of discipline specific language competencies to help students integrate their language 
development with the conceptual understandings they are acquiring within different disciplines.  All instruction is guided by 
the Common Core learning standards and includes opportunities for students to engage in oral and written discourse in which 
they present explanations, make conjectures, justify conclusions and argue from evidence across all disciplines.  Our 
instruction addresses the needs of students with various levels of English proficiency and with a variety of prior school 
experiences.  Instruction moves students forward by meeting them where they are and facilitating access to rigorous 
disciplinary language and content standards.  We utilize the UDL framework, to have curriculum that is universally designed to 
meet the needs of ELLs and make available a host of language supports, including visual representations of relevant 
vocabulary, maps that link concepts with words, and options that help students connect their own cultural backgrounds to 
new learning activities. Universally designed curriculum for ELLs provide both oral and written access to material and activities. 
Instruction provides the necessary support to ensure that all ELLs comprehend disciplinary texts and tasks.  This enables 
students to acquire the language and knowledge they need to become more independent learners.  Finally we use diagnostic 
and formative assessments to identify students' knowledge and academic language competencies in order to guide 
instructional practice.  In accordance with The Practitioners’ Work Group for Accelerating English Language Learner Student 
Achievement: Nine Common Features of Successful Programs for ELLs, our school ensures that curriculum and instruction are 
closely aligned to the language standards and The Next Generation Learning Standards.  We continuously and closely monitor 
ELL student progress so we can adjust instructional planning based on data obtained through formal and informal 
assessments.  Teachers present all learning tasks with multiple entry points so that all students can grasp instruction 
regardless of language proficiency and academic level. Various supporting materials (manipulatives, checklist and rubrics) are 
created by teacher teams and utilized in every lesson. These include the teacher created ELL scaffolds which have been

ELL scaffolds using the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework.  UDL guides the development of instructional features 
that can provide ELLs enhanced access to a variety of grade-level curricula. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

After new admits are deemed eligible to receive ENL services according to the NYSITELL, native Spanish speakers are given the 
Spanish LAB exam in order to appropriately evaluative, and determine language dominance.  In grades 3-5 a SIFE oral interview 
questionnaire is administered, before beginning the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS).    The MLS is a multilingual 
reading comprehension module with additional literacy sections available used to inform teachers and administrators of the 
home language literacy skills their students bring with them.  THE MLS tests reading comprehension, vocabulary, and early 
literacy in the students’ native language to inform teachers so they can plan instruction accordingly.  Additionally, students are 
given the option to take New York State Math and Science exams in their native language when available or through the use of 
an interpreter via the Department of Education's Translation and Interpretation Unit.

         None of our current students are considered to have had interrupted formal education (SIFE).  In the event of future 
admissions we will administer the oral interview questionnaire and the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS) for applicable 
languages.The SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire is a tool designed to help identify those students who are potentially students 
with Interrupted/Inconsistent Formal Education (SIFE) and provide them with appropriate services and interventions. ENL 
teachers will ensure that the identification processes of these students include the following steps;  Administering the Home

Language Identification Survey (HLIS) including conducting an interview in English and in the home language with the student 
and the parent/guardian, reviewing any student work samples, school records, and prior assessments, administering the New 
York State Identification Test for English Language Learners (NYSITELL), administering the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire, 
administering the Multilingual Literacy SIFE Screener (MLS).  We utilize the SIFE identification flow chart on the NYSED website 
to ensure we cover all the necessary steps in this process.  The Questionnaire and Guidance documents are available on the 
NYSED website.  According to the NYSED website they will also be releasing a SIFE ELA Foundational Low Literacy Curriculum to 
meet the needs of SIFEs who are at the 3rd grade level or below in home language literacy in secondary school where the 
instructional gap tends to be the greatest.The curriculum will offer a rigorous and accelerated framework aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) for providing students with the necessary content, language, and literacy necessary 
for achieving academic progress and success.  These students will then receive intensive language instruction along with 
content area instruction via our Integrated ENL model.  Accordingly, we do not have any students who are considered Long-
term ELLs, having received ENL instruction for seven or more continuously enrolled school years in the United States. Upon 
admission these students would be considered to receive additional academic support services by the RTI team. In order to 
best accommodate newcomers, native language “buddies” are assigned to each student when possible to lessen the stress of 
entering a new environment where communication and cultural norms differ from their own.  Newcomers also receive small 
group instruction tailored to their individual English Language Acquisition needs.  To help prepare these students for the New 
York State ELA exam which they are required to participate in after only one year of attendance in a U.S. school, they will be 
invited to participate in an afterschool or Saturday program.  This program introduces students to the format of taking 
standardized tests as well as other test taking strategies.  This group of students is also encouraged to use L1 to English 
dictionaries and glossaries, they may receive translated versions of New York State Math and Science exams, or interpretation 
services to participate in these exams, and we also utilize the native language supports provided within the Imagine Learning 
program. Developing ELLs, who have received ENL services for four to six continuously enrolled years in the United States, are 
provided with UDLs at their instructional level to make classroom content accessible to all.   We utilize UDL guidelines to 
provide multiple means of representation to help create resourceful, knowledgeable learners.  Some examples include 
activating or supplying background knowledge; highlighting patterns, big ideas, critical features and relationships; maximizing 
transfer and generalization; guiding information processing, visualization, and manipulation; clarifying vocabulary and 
symbols; clarifying syntax and structure; supporting decoding text, mathematical notation and symbols; promoting 
understanding across languages; illustrations through multiple media; offering ways of customizing the display of information; 
and offering alternatives for auditory or visual information.  We provide UDL scaffolds for action and expression to encourage 
strategic, goal directed learners.  Some strategies include, guiding appropriate goal setting; supporting planning and strategy 
development; facilitation of managing information and resources; enhancing students capacity for monitoring for progress; 
using multiple media for communication; using multiple tools for construction and composition; building fluencies with 
graduating levels of support for practice and performance; and allowing for varying methods for response and 
navigation.   Additionally the Integrated ENL program mirrors classroom content and objectives to support students towards 
achieving individual goals. Students within this category, who are considered “at-risk” according to the ELL Data Analysis Tool 
(EDAT), and through recommendations of the classroom and ENL teachers as well as any service providers, may receive 
additional Academic Intervention Services when deemed appropriate. Former ELLs will receive testing accommodations and 
one half unit or ninety minutes of Integrated ENL instruction for two years after scoring at the Commanding (formerly 
proficient) level on the NYSESLAT.  As previously mentioned former ELLs are provided with the UDLs.  Additionally,  we use the 
Core Core Collaborative Framework which provides for homogeneous grouping within a heterogeneous classroom, and 
emphasizes self and peer assessment and teacher feedback.  All ENL students also receive differentiated instruction through 
the Imagine Learning software program that supports and scaffolds them through independent practice and native language 
supports.  All ENL students are invited to the Title III morning program. The program is held twice a week, for an hour each 
day. K-2 students meet on Wednesday and 3-5 students meet on Friday. The students are taught in an integrated model and 
are supported by the ENL teacher and a Common Branch/Special Education teacher.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Grade appropriate English Language Arts, Math, Social Studies, and Science curriculum are taught using various differentiating, 
and scaffolding techniques.  Examples of these techniques include graphic organizers, TPR, realia, hands-on, 
and multisensory lessons.  The entire school uses the Journeys CCSS aligned program for literacy.  Each lesson outlines 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

specific scaffolded instruction for English Language Learners as well as strategic support.  Support for English learners' linguistic 
and academic progress is integrated into the core instruction. Throughout each lesson, the Student Book and Teacher's Edition 
provide instructional support that English learners need to read complex texts and meet high standards. Additionally, Great 
Minds’ Eureka Math Program is being utilized. Each unit has scaffolds integrated into it which give alternatives for how 
students access information as well as express and demonstrate their learning.  Strategically placed margin notes are provided 
within each lesson, elaborating on the use of specific scaffolds at applicable times.  These scaffolds address many needs 
specific to English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities.  Suggestions are organized by Universal Design for 
Learning (UDL) principles.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In order to meet the needs of our ELLs identified as having special needs, our staff is comprised of a variety of support 
specialists.  This includes a part-time social worker, and a part-time Psychologist, Occupational, Physical, Hearing and Speech 
Therapists.  In addition, monolingual and bilingual paraprofessionals are assigned to our ELLs when appropriate. If an ELL 
student requires a bilingual program they are provided with an alternate placement paraprofessional to meet their needs. 
ELLs that are identified as having special needs have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) that outlines expected 
educational outcomes for each student and recommends specific interventions. The school ESOL team has provided all related 
service providers and special education teachers with internal professional development to support language acquisition. 
During these professional development sessions they are provided with “can do” descriptors for all ELL students that is also 
identified as SWD. These descriptors for students are based on their language proficiency to support language acquisition and 
provided as an additional resource while monitoring and creating IEP goals. These services are monitored by the Department 
of Education and the Administrators of Special Education to ensure, that special education ELL students are placed in the 
legally-mandated least restrictive environment (SETSS, ICT, Self- Contained).  To determine the proper educational setting for 
ELL-SWDs there is a consultation meeting with parents, teachers, and the school assessment team, including a bilingual 
clinician.   Our school uses flexibility in programming to mainstream SWDs whenever possible.  Students in Self-Contained 
Special education classes participate in physical education classes with general education students.  Additionally some 
students are mainstreamed for certain subjects on a case by case basis.  When receiving ENL services, students with special 
needs are placed in groups with students in the same grade and English proficiency levels.  These groups contain both children 
who have IEPs and those who do not.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math, and other content areas are provided by an Academic Intervention 
Services teacher to former ELLs.  Students are chosen to receive AIS based on achieving levels 1 or 2 on state tests, or by 
teacher recommendation.  Students have access to iReady , and grades 1-2 use Leveled Literacy Intervention.  iReady  delivers 
the same grade-appropriate lessons to students, differentiated to their precise need. IReady further supports language growth 
with a standards-aligned custom curriculum that integrates phonics and fluency practice. Students receiving support in math 
are given instruction through the Zearn Math program.  Zearn Math is a coherent and rigorous K-5 curriculum delivered in a 
personalized rotational model. With Zearn Math, students learn in two ways: Independent Digital Lessons and Small Group 
Instruction. During Independent Digital Lessons, students learn at their own pace with digital manipulatives, paper and pencil 
transfer, and precise digital feedback at the moment of misconception. In Small Group Instruction, students work with 
concrete manipulatives, explain and share their math reasoning, and get direct feedback from their teachers and peers. 
Combined, every student has a daily personalized learning experience.   All instruction is provided in English.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

After reflecting upon the effectiveness of our ELL program in the past we have identified some strengths and needs for 
improving instruction. For example, we have found that simply grouping students by grade level is not the most effective way 
to plan for instruction. The data obtained from 2017’s NYSESLAT is as follows; Seventy-three students took the 2017 NYSESLAT, 
ten of which (13.7%) scored at the commanding level, and one scored at the expanding level and a level 3 on the ELA, these 
students have now exited ELL status, and thus are entitled to receive two years of former ELL services, which include 90 
minutes per week of English as a New Language, and two years of accommodations on assessments. Instead more of an 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

emphasis will be placed on grouping students based upon their language proficiencies. Based on data and trends, we have 
found that the implementation of the relatively new programs Journeys and Eureka Math have been successful in supporting 
student growth. Based on the latest IReady testing window on average our ELLs are increasing the level of the scale score of an 
average of 19 points (reading) compared to the Fall assessment window. For grades 3-5, they are adminstered the 
Performance Series Math assessment on average, our ELLs are achieving gain +195 on average. This form of assessment 
measures students gain throughout the year and is administered times per year (Fall, Winter, Spring). Our students need more 
emphasis on solving word problems more effectively. This year the school will move forward implementing the Core 
Collaborative Framework by beginning the use of  Math Progression. Aside from the work on peer and self assessments, 
students will continue with a continuum with examples that are color coded. These six examples are on display for students to 
assess where they fall on the progression. The six levels vary from basic to complex which will warrant a high effective score 
for the children. The idea is our students can pinpoint exactly where they and see the pathway in order to improve.   The 
Journeys Common Core reading program’s rigorous instructional design includes digital learning tools mobile apps, interactive 
whiteboard lessons and ELL friendly vocabulary support.  Grade teams completed unit plans to include additional UDL supports 
for each lesson. Eureka Math supports our ELL learners by focusing on conceptual learning using the model: Concrete-Pictorial-
Abstract learning.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Materials such as Smartboards, laptops, scanners, document cameras, ipads, Fundations phonics program, Journeys and 
Eureka Math ELL scaffolds, manipulatives, picture libraries, hands on science materials and leveled libraries are used to 
support ELLs. The Imagine Learning program, Raz-Plus, Brain Pop ESL, Activate and iReady are also utilized with ELL students.    
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Although our school only has an English as a New Language program, native language support is provided to some of our 
students with special needs through the assignment of bilingual paraprofessionals.  These paraprofessionals remain with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

students throughout the school day and provide native language support when necessary, in order to make lessons and 
assignments accessible to students. The Imagine Learning program offers support in the student's native language, and we also 
utilize Google translate at times. Additionally, multilingual glossaries, and dictionaries are made available to students.   As most 
students enter in the lower grades and are able to speak their home language, but neither read or write it, we do not currently 
have an extensive collection of Native language texts, however we plan on allocating a portion of the Title III Immigrant funds 
to enhance our collection of native language books, magazines and newspapers in the school Library. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

In programming, students are placed in groups with other ELLs on their grade level whenever possible.  This allows the ENL 
teacher to follow grade level curriculum, supporting content being taught in the classroom. Our whole school uses GAFE and a 
shared google drive to ensure ENL teachers have access to curriculum maps, so they can plan lessons that supplement and 
support grade level learning intentions.   Resources used include the Raz Plus ELL edition which has multilevel books many of 
which are available in Spanish, French, Polish, Ukrainian and Vietnamese, Key Reading and Foundational Reading skills 
materials.  These materials are available for each grade and with varying levels of language support.  As there are significantly 
less students who scored at the Entering or Emerging level on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL, those students may be grouped with 
other ELLs in subsequent grades during the 180 minutes of Stand Alone ENL instruction.   ELLs with special needs are placed in 
groups with students of similar age and grade levels when receiving services and resources.   Students may be grouped for ENL 
services within two continuous grades.

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We are now able to identify newly enrolled ELLs prior to the school year, with the early administration of the NYSITELL to pre-
enrolled students.  This is facilitated by the ENL teachers, Diana Puma and Daniel Castro.  Otherwise students are administered 
the NYSITELL examination within ten days of enrollment (if enrollment occurs during the school year) or within the first ten 
days of the new school year.  This exam identifies if a student is entitled to ELL services. Other than assessing students we do 
not currently have activities to assist newly enrolled ELLs before the school year.  Once the school year begins, In addition to 
the required  Parent Orientation meeting, we invite families to ENL Curriculum Conferences, where we inform them about the 
resources and services available to them, and provide insight to their child’s ENL education.  The parent coordinator, Dolores 
Galyas supports newly identified ELL students’ families by informing them of the various translation services available to them, 
and the free adult ESL classes that we offer in the school.  She also routinely keeps in touch with them via the translations 
done on school messenger, or Class Dojo.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Although parents have the option of choosing a bilingual program option for their child’s education,  and accepting a transfer 
to a school that has such a program, we do not currently offer any language electives at this time.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our teacher teams conducted a yearlong analysis of student samples, teacher evaluations using the Danielson Framework 
data, and a needs assessment completed by teachers to reflect and create our instructional focus for the 2017-2018, 2018-
2019  school years, with a focus on our English Language Learner (ELL) and Student with Disability (SWD) populations.  As a 
result, all staff at P.S. 52 will use evidence from formative assessments to monitor individual student progress towards meeting 
standards then they will understand a whole school initiative to raise student achievement by maximizing student 
engagement.  We will work to ensure that all students are intellectually engaged with challenging yet accessible content 
through well designed learning tasks and activities that require complex thinking by students.  All staff members use formative 
assessments to monitor student progress towards meeting standards to understand their students well, meet them where 
they are, and provide appropriate scaffolds to maximize student achievement.  Imbedded within our comprehensive 
professional development plan we have several ELL specific topics, geared towards teachers and staff who work with ELLs to 
support their learning and increase their English language proficiency.  We conduct ELL specific professional development 
study groups in working in our grade level impact teams we will use the Case Study Protocol.  All teachers and staff will be 
trained on the Case Study protocal by the Instructional Coach to be in line with the district wide focus. We will also continue to 
support  the school staff to utilize resources provided via the Office of English Language Learners.  Topics that follow are 
included in the PD plan for 2018-2019;  Distinguishing Language Acquisition from Learning Disabilities, Vocabulary Unpacked 
for ELLs, Academic Language for ELLs, Text Complexity for ELLs and Education/Learning Trust- Including English Learners/ 
Strategies for Academic Success. The focus of the last seminar participates explored four research based recommendations for 
engaging English learners in subject area instruction. PD is conducted on one day for two separate sessions for all the whole 
staff. Session 1-8-11:00 and 11:50-2:50.  Additionally teachers of ELLs  will attend various professional development offerings 
as they become available through the SIBFSC (Staten Island Borough Field Support Center). The professional development 
training that were attended this year were Target of Measurement, Proficiency Level Descriptions, NYSESLAT Training, 
Appropriate Evaluations/Assessments for Cultural Linguistic Needs and Representation, Nuts and Bolts:Critical ELL 
Components of Complicance, SIOP-Sheltered Intruction Observation Protocol for Teachers. For the 2018-2019 school year we 
anticipate the follow Collaborative Identfication with English Learners and Increasing Family Engagement for Academic Success 
for ELLs. Daniel Castro will also attend the Targets of Measurement PD during the summer of 2018.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 According to CR Part 154.2, fifteen percent of the total professional development hours for all teachers must be ELL 
specific.  Additionally ENL teachers will receive ELL specific professional development for fifty percent of their total pd 
hours.  We meet these requirements by scheduling and implementing professional development according to these guidelines. 
Teachers will participate in several ELL specific PD sessions during the 2018-2019 school year, topics listed above.  That 
equates to roughly twenty five percent of the total professional development. The Instructional Coach, Ann Marie Palmeri, 
retains sign in sheets and agendas for all sessions.  Furthermore, ENL teachers attend professional development offered by the 
Department of ELLs.  We will continue to ensure that all staff receive the required time of PD for the 2018-2019  school 
year.  Some workshops attended during the 2017-2018 school year included:  NYSESLAT training, Appropriate 
Evaluations/Assessments for Cultural Linguistic Needs and Representation, Nuts and Bolts:Critical ELL Components of 
Complicance, SIOP-Sheltered Intruction Observation Protocol for Teachers.  As new offerings become available, the ENL 
teachers will attend.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
     Our school coordinates annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, their child’s 
language development progress, the results of language proficiency assessments (NYSESLAT and NYSITELL), and the student’s 
language development needs in all content areas.  These meetings take place on Tuesday afternoons during parent 
engagement time.  This is in addition to the DOE scheduled parent teacher conferences and the mandated parent orientation 
meetings.  Attendees will include the child’s classroom teacher, ENL teacher, related service providers and a parent or 
guardian.  We will utilize bilingual staff members  for interpretation for Russian, Spanish, Arabic and Albanian families when 
requested.  For all interpretation in a language other than those mentioned above, we use the Department of Education’s 
Translation and Interpretation Unit’s Over-the-Phone Interpretation Services.  Parents are invited to these meetings which 
may take place either in person or over the phone, via appropriately translated letters. Parents are given several choices of 
dates and times, so that everyone can be accommodated. Copies of these letters as well as documentation of these meetings 
are maintained by the ENL teacher.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

In order to involve and engage parents in the academic success of their children we plan various activities, many which are 
specifically targeted to parents of ELLs.  Parents of ELLs are offered free adult ENL classes.  These classes are taught via a 
partnership with the Jewish Community Center of Staten island. The program is designed to help immigrants learn and 
improve their English language skills. The focus is to facilitate conversational English, reading and writing in order for parents 
to find employment, make promotional gains and increase involvement in their children’s education.  We will also engage 
parents by holding an information session to familiarize them with the home connection reports that will be sent home, once 
their child begins utilizing the Imagine Learning program. Various parent workshops are also offered to parents of ELL students, 
where literacy and language building strategies that can be used at home are shared.   We will have bilingual support staff on 
hand to facilitate discourse and assist parents in asking any questions they may have about the material 
presented.  Additionally, all families are invited to monthly parental engagement activities in the classroom where they have 
the opportunity to view their child’s work, and participate in a variety of learning activities. As part of our Title III parent 
engagement component, we hold an annual family literacy night, where ELLs and their families are invited to participate in 
literacy and art activities.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jane Mccord, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs each parent/guardian is given a 
home language survey when their child registers for P.S. 52. This survey includes questions for parents/guardians 
to indicate the language in which they prefer information to be given, and what language they prefer for oral 
communication. We utilize the RHLA (Home Language Aggregate Report) , and RAPL ((Report Adult Preferred 
Language) reports in ATS to access families’ home languages. A Language Needs Survey is given to Pre-K students 
and remains in the child's cumulative folder. Additionally , parents indicate their preferred language of 
communication in both oral and written form on the blue Student Emergency Contact Cards that are submitted at 
the beginning of every school year. Also, if parents indicate a different language preference other than English, 
they are then informed in writing (in their native language) of our schools translation and interpretation services. 
Furthermore, translated letters are sent home to families prior to the first Parent-Teacher Conference asking if 
they would like the service of an interpreter during conferences. If the parent indicates their interest, an

interpreter is found and provided either by a bilingual staff member or through the Translation and Interpretation 
unit. 

 
  

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency we would utilize School Messenger which translates into four high incidence 
languages. Additionally we would use the Translation and Interpretation over the phone translation services to reach 
other parents. Our staff also communicates with parents using Class Dojo which translates into thirty five languages. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

 
 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our school ensure that all staff is aware of the goal of CR A-663 by including a copy of the regulations to each staff 
member as part of the back to school September faculty conference notes. Additionally, we will outline the 
requirements outlined, and the resources available for us to meet these requirements, including utilizing bilingual 
staff members and the Translations and Interpretation Unit's services. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In order to fulfill Section VII of Chancellor’s Regulations A-663 regarding parental notification requirements for 
translation and interpretation services, the school's policy is to notify parents of the services that the school offers. 
We meet this requirement by making sure all parents whose primary language is not English are aware that we offer 
translation and interpretation services. When it is established that the parents have another primary language then 
they are verbally notified of the services. Also, written notification in their primary language is sent home. Additionally 
there is a posted notice in many different languages on the Parent Coordinator's bulletin board indicating which 
interpretation and translation services are available. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

To gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services provided we use the NYC School survey 
which asks questions pertaining to communication with the school staff, administration and community. We have 
adjusted to parents concerns by utilizing Class Dojo in every grade so that translations are available to parents, and 
also submitting requests for translations in a timely manner so that we may provide them with all handouts.
