Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

To love learning we need to engage the mind, body and soul. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

We believe our goal is to provide a solid educational foundation and a sense of community by engaging students in 
rich learning experiences. As a school, we strive each day to develop our students' knowledge, independence, 
confidence and character by building trust and encouraging meaningful relationships. We embrace learning by 
educating through many diverse curricula which evoke wonder and empower "the whole child". By continuing to

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

At Forest Elementary our is goal is to provide a solid educational foundation and a sense of community by engaging 
our students in rich learning experiences. As a school, we strive each day to develop our students’ knowledge, 
independence, confidence and character by building trust and encouraging meaningful relationships. We embrace 
learning by educating through many diverse curricula which evoke wonder and empower “the whole child”. By 
continuing to build community among staff, students and families, Forest Elementary opens the pathway for a 
journey of life-long learning and a clear vision for the future. 

In our school we have a shared belief that evaluations are utilized for the purposes of development. Therefore we 
have created systems and structures in which we can authentically engage and identify best practices which will have 
a substantial impact on our students’ learning. The structures of our school based teacher evaluation and 
development system are as follows: 

Observations are conducted in six weeks cycle 

Teachers are observed by a different school administrator every cycle 

Teachers receive a schedule of their observations and feedback sessions 

Teachers participate in collaborative face to face feedback sessions with their current administrator 

Student work is discussed during feedback sessions 

Built in common planning time that provides meaningful best teaching practices 

The school’s strategic assessment practices have led to teachers providing students with clear and significant 
feedback, which informs effective instructional adjustments and allows students to be reflective and understand their 
future learning needs.  

Our school has demonstrated huge progress in developing and sustaining strong family ties. Our parent association 
worked in partnership with our teachers in identifying a reading comprehension assessment, provide input on the 
teacher evaluation schedule and design and manage various parent engagement activities.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the 2017-2018 Framework for Great Schools: 

  90% of teachers of all subjects say that they had the resources to include opportunities for reading and 

writing experiences grounded in evidence from text, both literary and informational 

  88% responded positively to questions about Rigorous Instruction 
  89% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes feel challenged.  

Our school's priority need is modifying the Science and Social Studies curriculum to embed the ELA skills and 
standards.  

 

Our schools shared beliefs around teaching and learning has provided opportunities for students to be exposed to 
engaging and challenging learning experiences that require them to be reflective and critical thinkers. However, 
more strategically designed extension and enrichment tasks would further push students’ to demonstrate critical 
thinking in their work products.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all of our classes will have embedded at least 2 cognitively engaging tasks per unit in both Social Studies 
and Science that embed the ELA skills and standards. 

By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase in student proficiency rating in reading as measured by SRI.  

By June 2019, there will be an increase in student proficiency rating in math as measured by i-Ready

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our school community has created systems and structures in which our teachers have proved success developing 
teaching strategies that will meet the needs of every learner. On our quality review indicator 2.2 Assessment we 
earned a well developed because across the school, teachers and students use a myriad of assessment strategies that 
align to the school’s curricula and provide a comprehensive view of students’ strengths and next steps. However our 
families might not be aware of how to best support their child's academic career.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
Beginning October 2016 we will be providing customized parental workshops targeted on specific strategies that can be 
used at home. We will measure the impact the workshop by the results of the following formative assessments: For 
reading it will be the scholastic reading inventory and for math it will be the I-ready assessment.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Forest Elementary School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Forest Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children;

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35

sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Begin description here:            
 Based on the data analysis that was conducted using teachers observations, SRI, NYSESLAT 
speaking data and running records, we noticed that 65%of our ENL teachers needed to 
strengthen their practice pertaining to effective discussion techniques for our ENL learners.  We 
also noted that our students need to increase their academic vocabulary as 30% of our 
ENL population scored beginning readers in our SRI formative assessments.  The subgroups and 
grade levels of students to be served will be our newcomers ELLs in third, fourth and fifth 
grade.  The subgroup to be targeted are our developing ELL students. Our goal is to promote 
learning through discussion where students can make their thinking visible. While acquiring the 
English language, students’ will develop the ability to make inferences. The supplemental 
program will be scheduled every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 7:00am to 8:00am , for a 
total of 44 sessions. The program will begin the week of   December 8th   and conclude   on June 
18th  . For this supplemental program, two classes will be created. One class will consist of first 
and second grade students and the second class will consist of third to fifth grade students. Two 
ENL certified teachers will provide the instruction in English.   Our students will be conducting 
research on the immigration history of NYC and create projects in which they will create media 
presentations and implement drama skits, as well as write short novels.  
  
The materials selected are distinct from those used during our daily instruction. The program is 
“Discussion 4 Learning,” which is an oral vocabulary and language program. “Discussions 4 
Learning” introduces content rich academic vocabulary, while exposing students to images of 
cultures around the globe and across history. The program will also include an allotted time for 
students to engage in reading and writing activities (Included, but not limited to, reading of 
independent and guided lexile level texts, shared writing, shared close reading, etc).   
   
We will maintain the records ,attendance and program notifications in a binder that will be 
located in our school administrator's office.

Our school’s professional development focuses around assessment in instruction where teachers 
will use their data to inform their instruction. Teachers will use multiple data sources to develop 
their units of study as they create differentiated tasks and specific strategies for the different 
groupings of students. Once a week, for a block of two periods, teachers will meet with their

grade level teams for professional development around the instructional focus and topics stated 
above. The professional development program is as follows: Kindergarten Tuesdays, 6th and 7th 
period; 1st grade Thursdays, 6th and 7th period; 2nd grade Tuesdays, 2nd and 3rd period; 3rd 
grade Wednesdays 6th and 7th period; 4th grade Fridays,, 2nd and 3rd period; 5th grade 
Wednesdays, 3rd and 4th period. These sessions are facilitated by the grade-specific instructional 
coaches.  During the professional development time, teachers will learn effective teaching 
strategies that could be used for discussion and the engagement of students.  Teachers will 
receive professional development in designing cognitively engaging tasks specific to our ENL 
learners.   The instructional coaches are certified facilitators from the school reform initiative and 
have common branch certifications. In addition the 80 minutes on Mondays is used for teachers 
to continue this work.   During our professional development time, teachers will learn how to 
utilize the EDAT tool to guide their instruction. In addition, we will be conducting a book club 
using the second edition of Scaffolding Language and Scaffolding Learning  - Teaching English 
Language Learners in the mainstream classroom by Pauline Gibbons.

Begin description here:            
  
In addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during the ELL identification 
process, our school offers the following parent engagement activities. Every Tuesday, Cornell 
University conducts a parent nutrition workshop from 9 – 11 a.m. This series of workshops will 
run from October 21 until the end of December. Participating parents will receive a certificate of 
completion at the end of the series. The purpose of the this workshop is to create awareness of 
the alignment of healthy nutrition with academic achievement.  In addition, our families will 
engage in mathematical activities during these workshops. 
Using the newly allotted parent engagement time on Tuesdays, teachers invite parents to a 
workshop called “Critical Thinkers” to see how students are impacting the school and local 
community by becoming critical thinkers. Parental activities aligned to students becoming 
critical thinkers will continue throughout the year.  
Every month, the school hosts a “Family Movie Night” as well as a “Family 
Cultural/Celebration.” In addition, the parent coordinator hosts monthly parent workshops 
around topics such as Family Access Management, Bullying, Safety and Middle School. “Java 
with the Principal” workshops are also offered on monthly basis. These workshops are offered to 
ELL parents at two different times: 8:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. to accommodate them. “Parent 
Academy” workshops are offered to ELL, and all parents. An upcoming “Parent Academy” 
workshop around ELL teaching strategies will be conducted for our ELL parents (Date TBD). In 
conjunction with our supplemental after-school program for ELLs, trips to cultural and historical 
venues, such as the New York Historical Society and Ellis Island will occur for both students and 
their parents/guardians.  
  
Our ELL parents are notified of workshops by:

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use Running Records, Scholastic Reading Inventory (SRI) and concepts of print as assessments to determine the literacy 
skills of our ELLs. Students knowledge of letter identification and sounds, concepts of print and sight words are assessed first, 
followed by reading levels. Currently, the running record data for students’ reading levels reveal that the majority of our ELLs 
across grades K-5 are reading below grade level standards. This information helps inform our school’s instructional plan in 
many ways. Our ELLs in grades 1-5 who are in this category are placed in the Academic Intervention Services (AIS) program 
where they receive small group instruction to target their specific needs. In addition, most of these ELLs are Tier 2 RTI students 
who receive strategic small group instruction that best addresses their areas of need. Both classroom and  ELL push in and pull 
out teachers will strategically plan small group instruction, including work with guided reading. At PS 71, we also administer 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

the NYC Performance Assessment. This enables teachers to better understand the needs of their ELLs as writers and use it to 
plan for whole group, small group and one-on-one instruction.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Each grade has a common planning time in which they meet and do inquiry work.  Teachers have vertical professional 
development series at the school based level.  In addition, our instructional coach provides support in all areas. We have 
established a MOSL committee which analyzes data and looks at common trends across all grades.  At PS 71 we have created a 
blended learning model which enables students to learn across content areas using the technology component. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Currently at PS 71, we use unit pre and post assessments, I-ready, and Scholastic Reading Inventory (SRI) for grades second 
through fifth.  Kindergarten uses concepts of print and TCWRP running records. Once a student reaches a running record of 
level H, they will then begin SRI. In addition, we use NYC Performance Assessment. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

MOSL committee analyzes data and looks for trends across grades. Teacher use formative classroom assessments to plan and 
drive their instruction.  SRI and I ready data is used to form small group instruction based on students strengths and 
weaknesses. 
  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Teachers analyze both formal and informal assessments to plan small group instruction.  In addition, inquiry work is a factor in 
determining support services.Constant monitoring of progress is done using Informal Reading Inventories, SRI data, lexia data, 
I-ready and daily note taking.  Our school has two AIS positions and one coach position to look at best practices and supports 
staff to help meet the needs of individual students.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The outcome assessment data used to evaluate and inform our ELL program are, NYSESLAT, ELA, Math state assessment, NYC 
Performance Assessment, I- Ready and Lexia. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Our school has two AIS positions and one coach position to look at best practices and supports staff to help meet the needs of 
individual students.   In addition, teachers have common planning time allocated to look at student work and ways to best fit 
their needs.           

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Currently, ELL students are grouped heterogeneously and are immersed into general education classes.  Students 
receive push in and or pull out services from ENL AIS teachers. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 Instruction for ELLs is aligned with the Common Core Standards, and delivery of  ELL services is provided through a 
combination of standalone and ENL pull-out/push-in/co-teaching model. ELLs are grouped heterogeneously in classes 
according to their grade level and travel together in a group. Most classes have more than one proficiency level.  Instruction is 
delivered using the push in/ pull out model.  The  teachers use differentiated instruction along with materials. Students work in 
small groups where their areas of need are addressed. Within those groups, the ENL teacher focuses on ENL strategies and 
methodologies based on the level of the ELL students in the group. A small number of Special Education students  that are in 
various self-contained, ICT or general education classes who are eligible for ESL services, are either pulled out into a small 
group in order to adhere to the students’ IEPs regarding group size, and in order to maximize scheduling and small 
group/individualized instruction, or serviced using the push in model. 
 
 ELL students are grouped by grade level and are mostly heterogeneously placed within a freestanding ELL classroom. Scores 
on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT tests are used to determine program eligibility for each student.  Once program eligibility is 
determined, ENL/ AIS teachers will provide students with the mandated number of minutes required.  We currently have three 
out of the classroom ENL /AIS teachers who will be serving ELL learners from Kindergarten through Fifth grade. 
 As per part 154 requirements: 
•   Beginner/Entering level students receive 180 minutes standalone ENL plus 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA for a total of 
360 minutes. 
 
•   Low Intermediate/Emerging students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes 
standalone or integrated ENL or any other content area. 
 
•   Intermediate/Transitioning students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction plus 90 minutes standalone or 
integrated ENL or any other content area. 
 
•   Advanced/Expanding Students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction. 
 
•   Proficient/Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/other content area instruction. 
 
 
     Our staff is organized appropriately through proper school scheduling by the administration here at P.S. 71. There is 
communication between the administration, classroom teachers, prep teachers, other service providers, and ELL teachers 
ensuring that all programs are given their mandated amount of time and no conflicts are made. Generally, scheduling 
meetings are held at the start of each new year where all information is collected ensuring proper scheduling for all classes. 
This also ensures that classroom teachers and ELL teachers have the chance to coordinate both scheduling and instruction 
together. Teachers discuss scheduling to be sure that there are no last-minute conflicts during the time that ELL services are 
delivered. 
     We assure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program 
by carefully aligning the ENL/AIS teacher schedules with the schedules of the teachers into whose classes the teachers are 
pushing into. Scheduling conflicts are avoided through collaboration with related service providers who also work with the ELL 
student population (i.e. speech services, occupational therapy, etc.). Our program is a free standing ELL model and push in/pull 
out services, as needed, aligned with New York State Standards with a minimal amount of pull-out instruction when necessary. 
Students enjoy maximum involvement in classroom activities as well as the support they need through ESL methodologies and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

differentiated instruction. Scaffolding, differentiation, and modeling are used on a regular basis. 
 
 a.      Explicit ESL instruction is delivered in the ENL program through planning, cooperation, and communication between the 
ELL and classroom teachers. ELL classroom teachers of ELL students have 5 common prep periods per week with teachers on 
the same grade in order to compare data, share ideas and plan for instruction. Language development is encouraged by the 
ENL teachers through this collaborative planning and instruction.  Together the teachers establish a low anxiety environment 
with comprehensible input, opportunities for the ELL learner to work in cooperative groups, to interact with peers and 
awareness of the stages of language acquisition.  Small groups targeting similar needs and levels, and differentiation of 
instruction is used on a daily basis. Scaffolding activities encourage students to achieve greater language proficiency through 
modeling language, providing high interest activities and pairing with a buddy to foster language development and risk taking. 
 
     A wide variety of assessment are used to assess development across the four modalities and to drive further instruction 
within the Zone of Proximal Development through social interaction and academic content-based activities.  Assessment drives 
instruction.  Informal assessments include portfolios, teacher observation, and teacher/student conferencing.  Formal 
assessments include NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, I-Ready, SRI, Lexia, as well as State ELA and Math assessments where appropriate. 
 
Student needs are assessed and adjusted accordingly based on their performance. We engage our students in a wide variety of 
activities on a daily basis.  We support our students with strong visuals, demonstrations, and shared experiences.  Our ELL 
students listen, speak, read and write while striving for high standards and enhancing their success.  In short, P.S. 71’s teachers 
target each student’s special need and work with these students on a regular basis in order to build academic and language 
proficiency. 
 
     Instruction is developed to meet the specific needs of our ELL population. Students receive additional support through our 
differentiated instruction and small, leveled groups. There are several implications for the school’s LAP and instruction.  New 
classes need to continue to be developed to address the specific needs of our students in each grade level, as described above. 
Professional development in ESL strategies/methodologies provided to staff on a regular basis. K and 1will emphasize more 
Listening and Speaking. Grades 2, 3, 4 & 5 will continue to emphasize Reading and Writing. Content-based Vocabulary (domain 
specific) is emphasized in all grade levels. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Each content area of instruction is delivered in English. In all program models, teachers focus on aligning their lessons with the 
CCLS using instructional best practices. While delivering instruction, teachers are aware of the importance of picture supports, 
interactive word walls, as well as various ENL methodologies to support our ELL population. Books in the native language are 
encouraged for students to use, as well as word for word dictionaries in their native language in grades 3-5. In addition, 
technology is utilized through the use of the Smart Board, document cameras and computer websites. Students are also paired 
with a same language buddy. Content area dictionaries for science and social studies are available.   Moreover, our blended 
learning model enables students to learn content across all areas within the use of technology. 
 
                The content areas are delivered and made comprehensible in the program model through the use of technology 
(Smart Boards, Lap Tops), charts, pictures, diagrams, manipulatives, posters, real objects, flash cards, vocabulary, hands-on 
projects, and computer assistance (the Smart Board, Desktop, and Lap Top computers are used on a regular basis). Students 
are given hands-on experience in all content areas to help foster understanding. With the assistance of all teachers in our 
building (content-area, classroom, ENL, and any other service provider) we hold many events on a regular basis. We have an 
annual Science Fair which involves all students working in groups to make a project, a Harvest Festival which introduces new 
vocabulary and cultural activities, walking trips in the community which address real life experiences and vocabulary for social 
studies, Social Studies projects which cover a variety of skills, Art projects throughout the year, where students use math and 
measuring skills and Community worker visits. The content becomes more comprehensible for second language learners 
through all of these hands-on activities and visuals, with emphasis put on explaining vocabulary and following instructions 
delivered.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

PS 71 was able to keep two Literature through dance classes open to provide a more rich approach to literature, particularly 
for our ELL students. In addition, were were able to open a second STEM class, also to the benefit of our ELL population. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 Upon initial placement in ELL programs, Spanish speakers are given the Spanish LAB as per mandates, within the first five days 
of entry. All speakers of other languages are provided with the opportunity to have translated tests for Content Areas (Science, 
Math) where available or the assistance of approved translators for content area tests.           
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a.  In this school year, there were no students identified as SIFE on the BESIS survey at P.S. 71.; however, P.S. 71 has developed 
a plan for SIFE students, should any arrive. Leveled libraries within the SIFE students’ classrooms will range from two levels 
below to one level above the SIFE student’s identified reading level. The guidance counselor will work with each student to 
generate a profile that will include emotional and affective factors which impact on learning. SIFE students will receive 
language appropriate testing in order to screen for learning disabilities. We invite parents to the school in order to learn about 
their cultural and family backgrounds. Students will be provided with differentiated instruction, which will include grouping by 
ability and need in order to focus on developing specific targeted skills in order to maximize gains. Self-contained classes will 
be formed, if justified, by need and numbers of students. 
 
P.S. 71 also does the following: 
●             Assign the students “buddies” to help get them accustomed to the daily schedule and school environment. Students 
are encouraged to sketch as much as they can and try to label and/or explain their writing to their buddy. 
●             Activate prior knowledge; Utilize multiple entry points that will enable students to feel motivated and not frustrated. 
●             Use visuals, have students be “hands on” whenever possible; in other words, have them create their own glossaries, 
use manipulatives, have them do interactive technology assignments at the SMART board or on the laptops using programs 
such  as I- Ready, Lexia and SRI. When teaching new vocabulary, rephrase, define within the context of the word, pause and 
use intonations when necessary. 
* Foy younger grades, students use the work station model where they rotate in groups to participate in and create different 
learning experiences. 
 
b. Describe your plan for ELLs in US schools less than three years (newcomers): 
        Newcomer ELL students get differentiated instruction with a strong emphasis on methodologies to increase BICS and CALP 
vocabulary, spelling, grammar, and critical thinking skills. Newcomer ELLs receive differentiation through whole group, small 
group and one-on-one conferences on a daily basis to meet their individual needs. This may include AIS. Native language texts, 
as well as books at various grade levels are available in classrooms to support their language development. These students are 
also paired with a same language buddy for additional support. They also have access to ELL based technology. This includes a 
wide range of online websites such as I-Ready, Lexia & SRI. These students are grouped together to allow for more 
individualized attention from the teachers.  Picture support is utilized within the instruction and students begin by sketching as 
much as they can and explain in their native language what they are sketching to support the literacy instruction in the 
classroom. As students progress they may begin to label and write in English. Picture dictionaries are available in all grades and 
in grades 3-5 word to word dictionaries are also available as needed. In addition, students are acclimated to life in the USA 
when taking trips outside of the building and through developing social skills by speaking with teachers and peers. 
                Guidance Counselors are available to assist students that are having difficulty adjusting to the New York City 
educational system and the demands of participating in their new educational environment.  
                Parents are an essential ingredient to the success of all students, especially those who are new to an English language 
school system. In order to assist the parents with helping their children to succeed, P.S. 71 employs a full-time bilingual 
Spanish Parent Coordinator. The parent coordinator holds parent orientation meetings and various workshops throughout the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

year where they learn about the Common Core Curriculum, standards, assessments, and how to help their children at home. 
These workshops also provide parents/guardians with the opportunity to attend a variety of family literacy and math 
workshops, so they can better assist in the education of their children at home. Parents will also become familiar with the new 
CCLS. They will also become familiar with the ELA Performance Standards. Our staff will continuously work to involve parents 
further in their children’s academic success.  All teachers continue to work to improve communication with the families of our 
ELL students. Flyers for all parent activities are posted on our “parent’s bulletin board,” sent home in several languages and 
distributed by hand at dismissal. 
In addition, our school hosts once a month parent engagement meetings in which parents are invited to come to our school 
community and engage in theme based learning activities with their children. 
 
             P.S. 71 uses the services of translators with the ability to prepare written correspondence to go out to the parents of 
the various language groups as well as to be available to translate the written responses from the parents. We brought parents 
and students of early registered Kindergarten students in before the start of school in September for evaluation and to discuss 
our programs with parents in a one-on-one environment. Parents were able to meet relevant staff and engage in discussions 
and ask any questions. We also always encourage parents to attend ELL parent conferences offered by the Department of 
Education. 
             
c. & d. Describe your plan for ELLs receiving 4-6 years service and your plan for long-term ELLs: 
              ELLs receiving 4 to 6 years of service also have word to word dictionaries available, books in their native language and 
access to technology. Students receive differentiated instruction during classroom instruction. They may be included in RTI or 
AIS groups as well. Teachers analyze data from formal and informal assessments such as the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math State 
assessments, NYC Performance Assessment, ELL Periodic Assessment, SRI and classroom checklists to determine each 
student’s needs and use this data to plan for whole group, small group and one-on-one conferences. Technology is also 
utilized with these students through various websites and programs such as SRI, I- Ready and Lexia. These students are usually 
the ones who are given priority to attend the after school NYSESLAT program to enhance their language development and 
proficiency level. Instruction is heavily focused on writing to allow students the opportunity to elaborate upon their thoughts. 
However, all the modalities of language are also weaved into the program. 
              At this time, we do not have any long term ELLs. However, if we did we would continue to duplicate instructional 
strategies as we do for students who are here 4-6 years. A team of teachers, administration and support staff  analyze their 
data to develop a strategic plan to enhance their academic skills.  
e. Describe your plan for former ELLs: 
              Commanding students are serviced by an ENL teacher for 90 minutes a week as per the CR-Part 154.2.  They will have 
direct instruction activities to support language development. They will also be offered the opportunity to participate in the 
Title III Program for ELLs. They will be invited to partake in any of the activities offered to ELLs. Former ELLs receive extended 
time on all assessments for up to 2 years after deemed commanding on the NYSESLAT. This includes all classroom 
assessments, performance assessments, and state assessments.  Former ELLs may be placed in RTI for additional support 
services. Differentiated data driven instruction is planned to support and further the development of our ELLs in all subgroups. 
Instruction is standards based and teachers scaffold the instruction throughout the day to address the needs of the students. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers utilize the work station model for lower grades which provides students with the opportunity to have hands on 
activities across different contents areas.  Students are able to work in groups and rotate through the various 
stations.  Students also have the opportunity to create their own stations. In addition, students work in the blended learning 
model which enables them to learn through the use of technology across all content areas.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
   AT P.S. 71, ELL students with special needs receive services from a certified ENL teacher through the pull-out/push-in model. 
Programs are created in order to ensure time (and group size) mandates are met.  In this case, the group size would not 
exceed 12 students in order to fulfill the mandates of the student’s IEP.  Instruction is developed pertaining to the matters of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

grouping, teaching methodology, testing accommodations and assessment, through the information provided on the student’s 
IEP. Teachers of ELL-SWDs who receive support services such as OT, PT, SETSS, and Speech work closely with the service 
providers to discuss strategies and methods to meet individual student’s needs, as well as their IEP goals. Teachers on each 
grade level have common planning time,  as well as inquiry time, where they discuss the curriculum and strategies that 
work.  Teachers also have peer to peer feedback in which they come together to view a particular lesson, then teachers on the 
panel provide actionable feedback and next steps. ELLs with IEPs who are in ICT or self contained (12:1:1) classes receive their 
ELL services from a push-in/pull-out certified ELL teacher. 
 ELL-SWDs receive the same mandated minutes of ELL services as students in the general education environment 
•   Beginner/Entering level students receive 180 minutes standalone ELL plus 180 minutes integrated ELL/ELA a total of 360 
minutes.  
•   Low Intermediate/Emerging students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes integrated ELL/ELA and 90 minutes 
standalone or integrated ELL or any other content area. 
•   Intermediate/Transitioning students receive 90 minutes of integrated ELL/ELA instruction plus 90 minutes standalone or 
integrated ENL or any other content area. 
•   Advanced/Expanding Students receive 180 minutes of integrated ELL/ELA or other content area instruction. 
•   Proficient/Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ELL/ELA or ENL/other content area instruction. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
P.S. 71 employs many forms of intervention for students.  P.S. 71 offers Response to Intervention (RTI Services) to students in 
need.  In addition, we have  Math and ELA AIS providers, as well as three ENL/AIS providers. Also, teachers engage in  Inquiry 
Cycles every six weeks. Our teachers offer intervention services to these children throughout the year, focusing on each child’s 
specific area of need.  This is usually done throughout the school day in very small groups. There is also an after-school test 
prep program prior to the NYS exams. This may include one on one tutoring in various content areas, including Math and ELA.  
 
      Intervention Services for ELLs throughout the school year focus on each ELL’s specific areas of strengths and 
weaknesses.  The information for targeting the student’s strengths and weaknesses are found on state ELA scores, state Math 
scores, the NYSYSLAT, and in class, ongoing pre and post assessments. Teachers keep individual student portfolios with unit 
test scores, final projects, samples of student work, as well as any other form of intervention that the student has participated 
in.  This includes communication with parents and any other staff member who are involved in the students’ academic 
success.  This is accomplished, in part, during weekly Teacher Team Meetings.  Teams are comprised of teachers who teach the 
same grade and subject.  During these meetings, student work is reviewed, analyzed and evaluated.  This enables teachers to 
share scaffolds, best practices, and plan for effective ways to address students’ individual strengths, weaknesses and 
educational needs. ENL teachers also participate in these meetings to address language-related instructional issues as well as 
issues that relate to the individual needs of students receiving ENL instruction, such as classroom testing and various ways to 
scaffold and differentiate instruction.  During these meetings recommendations are made for related services for ELLs with 
IEPs. 
 
These interventions include: 
o   Small Group Instruction or conferencing 
o   Individual Conferencing 
o   Scaffolded Instruction 
o   Facilitation of extended test times during classes 
o   After School Title III programs 
o   Homework Help 
 
      The Blended Learning Model is implemented throughout the school for all students, particularly  ELL students.  This 
includes the software programs of I-Ready, Lexia, and SRI. Smart Boards are accessible in all classrooms to assist instruction 
and provide interactive learning for ELLs. 
     For all content areas: ELA, Science, Social Studies and Math, our teachers at P.S. 71 continue to assess students on a regular 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

basis, both formally and informally. Teachers keep updated data portfolios with test scores, samples of student work, as well 
as any other form of intervention that takes place. Students are provided with next steps to help them focus more closely and 
individually on the areas of need. Teachers also share good communication with parents and any staff member who is involved 
in the students’ academic success. 
     Our ELL students who have not met the performance standard in ELA  participate in small-group instruction whenever 
possible. They receive instruction from both their classroom teachers,  ENL licensed service providers and/or an AIS teachers. 
The students are grouped by reading  or NYSESLAT level and have an opportunity to participate more while in these reading 
groups. Within these groups, they use books on their specific level to work on and understand certain skills. They can ask more 
questions, they can find the answers in the text more often, and they can decode unfamiliar vocabulary words on a more 
regular basis. This small-group time also allows the teachers to assess on a more regular basis what is needed to move the 
student forward.  Students may also receive one-on-one instruction in certain cases. This may be reserved for students who 
are  below reading level even after 3 years. It may also be for students who have trouble focusing on what they reading or 
answering questions. They are engaged in shared reading, guided reading, independent reading, questioning, accountable talk 
as well as developing language experiences. Instruction is geared toward skills and strategies which will build literacy, such as 
inferring, main idea, and cause and effect.  We enhance reading development using various ELL strategies such as scaffolding, 
vocabulary building, and reading comprehension. 
     ELL students who have not met the performance standard in ELA, specifically writing, are given instruction by both the 
classroom teachers and ENL/AIS providers. These students are placed in small writing groups and are grouped by similar needs. 
For example, if three students continue to struggle with writing topic sentences, then those students would work together 
with a teacher in that small group to attack that skill. The students would have extra opportunities to participate and share 
their ideas about that skill. The teacher is also able to assess the next skill that needs to be worked on while in those smaller 
groups. In certain circumstances, a teacher may work on writing one-on-one with a student who is still struggling with basic 
writing mechanics such as sentence structure or organization of writing. All students are involved in shared writing, modeled 
writing, independent writing and interactive writing. These students receive extra instructional minutes whenever possible. 
During these minutes, the students have the opportunity for extra writing conferences and editing. Writing portfolios, next 
steps, SmartBoard technology, NYSESLAT test prep (writing portion) and other  intervention programs may also be used. 
Informal assessments include benchmark writing, running records, portfolios, teacher observation, and teacher/student 
conferencing. Conferencing is often delivered on a one-on-one basis, or in a very small group based on similar needs. Formal 
assessments include NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Ready Gen, and other standardized tests. 
     Our ELL students who require targeted intervention in Science or Social Studies participate in whole-class instruction with 
differentiation, small-group instruction, and cooperative learning groups whenever possible. The students work in small groups 
with the assistance of one content area Science teacher and social studies teacher. Students have an opportunity to participate 
more while in these cooperative groups. They can ask more questions, and they are exposed to many content area vocabulary 
words on a more regular basis. This small-group time also allows the teachers to assess on a more regular basis what is needed 
to move the student forward.  Students may also receive one-on-one instruction in certain cases. Students are given a wide 
variety of books within that content area and ELL students receive extra opportunities to participate in school-wide initiatives 
involving Science or Social Studies (e.g. Science Fair, Cultural Events, Class trips, etc).  In Science, students are involved in many 
hands-on projects, which makes the information more comprehensible to them. 
In addition, we have kept two Literature through Dance classes open in which teachers make Literature more accessible to ELL 
students. 
Also, we have opened another STEM class this year which also provides ELL students with rich Science, Technology, 
Engineering and Math opportunities.  The program enables them to have  hands- on experiences, while at the same time the 
opportunity to build and create. 
 
      ELL students who are in need of targeted intervention in Math, or have not met the performance standard in Math, are 
given differentiated instruction on a daily basis. These students participate in whole-class instruction and are then able to work 
in guided math groups based on their specific needs. Students are involved in math games, the use of many math 
manipulatives (pattern blocks, rulers, flash cards, dice, protractors, geometric shapes, etc.), the Math Problem of the Day, as 
well as instruction using small math groups using the Smart Board for a hands-on experience.  Math Word Walls and Math 
Centers are displayed in every room. These Word Walls and Centers are used interactively (e.g. students may see pictures or 
diagrams to help them visualize the math concept).  For example, if three students continue to struggle with word problems, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

then those students would work together with a teacher in that small group to attack that skill. The students would have extra 
opportunities to participate and share their strategies in using that skill. The teacher is also able to assess the next skill that 
needs to be worked on while in those smaller groups. In certain circumstances, a teacher may work on math one-on-one with 
a student. Assessments include unit tests, NYS Math exam,  math journals, teacher observation, and teacher/student 
conferencing. Conferencing is often delivered on a one-on-one basis, or in a very small group based on similar needs. Students 
in grades 3 through 5 are also invited to an after-school test prep program for Math prior to the NYS Math standardized test. 
Go Math program is being used as well as Exemplars.  Struggling students are identified and receive Math AIS services by our 
provider. 
    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on data trends, this year we will have three out of the classroom ENL teachers servicing students in grades Kindergarten 
through Fifth.  In addition, we were able to maintain two Literature through Dance classes and open an additional STEM class. 
 
  In partnership with our Parent Association, clubs are now offered on Monday through Friday afternoon after school from 
2:20-5:30. ALL students in grades PK-5 are given the opportunity to apply for their top 3 club choices. Some of the clubs 
offered are Competition Cheer leading, School Newspaper, School Yearbook, Cooking Club, Chorus, Intramural Athletics. 
 After-School programs will also be available to ELLs who have difficulty obtaining proficiency on the Reading or Writing 
portion of the NYSESLAT. ELL students will also be offered the opportunity to participate in our after-school Test Prep program 
in the two months prior to the state exams.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 All ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs. ELL students are invited to participate in any after-school 
programs offered, such as after-school Test Prep. ELL students are included in every school program, including Art, Computers 
and Music, etc. This is ensured by every class being scheduled equally on the school’s prep schedule. Every class also has the 
opportunity to participate in every school activity and special event equally. Some of these activities include a Science Fair, 
Harvest Festival, Halloween Parade, Poem in a Pocket Day, Family Movie Night, Dance/Social events, etc. 
     Students on all grade levels are provided with computer based instructional programs (I-Ready, SRI, Lexia).  These computer 
based programs are offered in both the computer lab and at computer stations found in each classroom. Headphones are 
provided for each student so they may use the program properly and without distraction. These programs establish each 
student’s strengths and weaknesses and provides individualized instruction accordingly. Students are assessed periodically and 
instruction is further revised. We also print out usage data and reports (SRI),  and extra reports which are useful for teachers to 
plan instruction for each student.  
Additionally, students learn through the blended learning model and work stations. 
     If any ELL student should require Speech, SETTS, Special Education, Occupational Therapy or Physical Therapy, the service is 
offered and provided to them as required.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our Blended Learning Model enhances learning through the use of technology across all grade levels.  Native language texts, as 
well as books at various grade levels are available in classrooms to support both their native language and their English 
language acquisition. Technology is made available through the use of listening centers, I-pads, and computers to access 
instructional websites. Picture and word to word dictionaries are available for students to use as necessary. All ELL classrooms 
are equipped with ELMO document cameras and/or Smart Boards to enhance lessons. This year we were awarded with a grant 
which provided students with new laptops to take home for additional support. 
 "NYSESLAT and Beyond" preparatory books and “Discussion 4 Learning” are used as supplemental resources within the 
afterschool NYSESLAT program.      
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Within our ELL classrooms, there are native language books, bilingual dictionaries/glossaries and websites for students to 
access to support their native language development and their English language acquisition. Picture and word to word 
dictionaries are also available for ELLs. Students are paired with a same language buddy to support their language 
development to create and develop a level of comfort especially for our newcomers and transitional students. New students 
are also paired up with a buddy that speaks their home language in order to give them social support which in turn makes 
them more comfortable academically.  Furthermore, we make connections with cognates in languages so students can use 
their native language to develop the acquired English language. Classroom libraries also have a variety of bilingual books that 
students can borrow and read. Some are also on CD for listening centers. Translated tests and translators are offered to 
students for the New York State content area exams. 
   Home language is assessed at the time when the LAB- R is administered. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
All ELLs are placed in the age appropriate grade regardless of their prior school background. Each classroom has leveled 
libraries with grade appropriate leveled books and resources, that fit the needs of their proficiency level. Picture dictionaries 
are available for ELLs at all grade levels and word to word dictionaries are available for student use in grades 3-5. ELLs in all 
grades have specific websites that support their language needs both in technology and in the classroom technology centers. I-
Ready, SRI and Lexia computer assessments (and activities) are set up by grade level. All books purchased and provided are 
appropriate for all students' age levels. When a student participates in any program, all activities are age and grade-level 
appropriate. In addition, listening centers, and workstations, are available to further enhance their language needs. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Upon registration and in the later part of the summer, eligible ELLs are interviewed by a licensed teacher prior to the start of 
the  school year. In September, before the start of school, parents of pre-registered Kindergarten children were invited to bring 
in their children for ELL assessments  and to have a brief one-on-one interview with the ENL staff. P.S. 71 also employs a full-
time Parent coordinator who organizes informative opportunities for parents. The early assessment of student skills gives us 
information about the students’ abilities and appropriate placement needs. Activities for new ELLs who enroll throughout the 
school year include an orientation to show the students around the school as well as placing the students with a buddy to help 
them acclimate to the new school environment. If the student speaks little or no English, we try to pair them up with a student 
who speaks their language.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In this school year, P.S. 71 will hold vertical professional staff development workshops geared toward teachers with ELL 
students in their classes. Staff developments will be conducted by ENL teachers, the Instructional Coach, as well as Department 
of Education staff developers. Workshop topics specifically geared toward the ENL program may include:Academic Vocabulary, 
Helpful Suggestions to the Classroom Teachers with ELL’s, Introduction to the ELL Program, Strategies to Use in Your 
Classroom, Determining  Eligibility, The NYSESLAT, and Finding More Information. We will also have workshops on the 
Common Core Curriculum and Standards. These workshops also turn-key valuable information from other sources, such as 
“Integrated Curriculum and Instruction” focusing on research. ENL teachers participate in a wide variety of staff development 
offered at our school.  All teachers, including ELL teachers, will participate in other workshops such as: technology workshops , 
SESIS Training, Respect For All (Anti-Bullying), Child Abuse, and Common Core Standards for Math and ELA. Personnel involved 
in receiving professional development are: General Education Classroom Teachers, Special Education Classroom Teachers, 
Content Area Teachers (STEM, Music, Art and PE), ELL Teachers, Assistant Principals, Paraprofessionals, Guidance Counselors, 
Psychologists, Speech Therapists, and our Parent Coordinator, among others. 
      We have two Speech Therapists, as well as two Occupational Therapists and one Physical Therapists who also provide 
assistance and staff development in a variety of strategies and areas. There are workshops offered for all staff in different 
content areas. For example, Response to Intervention, The Referral Process, Strategies to Help At-Risk Students, Strategies in 
Math and ELA, as well as Science and Social Studies Workshops as needed. There is staff development for all teachers on staff 
on Election Day, Brooklyn Queens Day, after school, during the day -  common preps, as well as outside workshops offered 
through the DOE and the UFT. We will work with all our specialists, as well as our administration to provide additional support 
for all members of our staff. P.S. 71 will also send our ENL staff to the The Office of English Language Learners (OELL) for 
various professional development/workshops they offer. These workshops provide opportunities for ELL teachers to enhance 
their knowledge in the field of teaching ELLs. This will allow our ENL teachers the opportunity to learn about different 
strategies that will support their students. ELL teachers who attend are then encouraged to turnkey this information with their 
colleagues. 
This year, all teachers will become more familiar with the New Language Arts Progressions which serve as a framework for the 
NYSESLAT. 
     
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
At P.S. 71, teachers meet weekly with their colleagues during their common planning, as well as scheduled inquiry time  to 
discuss curriculum and analysis of student work. During these meetings, ENL teachers share their knowledge of ENL 
methodologies and experiences to help support teachers who may need assistance in scaffolding instruction for their students. 
Through these sessions, all staff is provided with information focusing on ENL techniques and methodologies. This training 
exceeds the minimum hours of training for all staff.  Teachers of the ELA, Math, and NYSESLAT after school programs, as well 
as AIS/RTI, ENL teachers work collaboratively with classroom teachers to differentiate instruction and share data as needed. 
These experiences allow other staff the opportunity to better understand the needs of our ELL students and strategies and 
methodologies that may work for them.  Grade level team keep records of agendas for each session in a designated grade 
folder. Teachers who are currently maintaining their professional certification also keep a personal log of these hours for their 
own records. Records of all workshops are maintained in the form of sign-in sheets, agendas, and certificates of attendance 
given to the teachers upon request.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ELL department in collaboration with the Parent Coordinator and Language Proficiency Team (LPT) will work together to 
provide provisions for interpretations and translations, both oral and written, of all pertinent information. Individual meetings 
will be held to discuss the goals and progress of ELL students.   Last year, pairs of ENL teachers and Guidance Counselors 
conducted home visits to ELL students. Our ENL teachers and guidance counselors are fully bilingual. Also, we were able to 
provide  an Arabic para professional to accompany them to translate for our  Arabic speaking community. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Parent involvement at P.S. 71 is ongoing and conducted in cooperation with the parent coordinator. All parents, including ELL 
parents, are invited to many activities, workshops, and meetings held here at Forest Elementary. 
 
    Parents of newly enrolled Kindergartners are invited to bring their children for assessment as well as to meet with ELL staff 
to discuss our program and to have an opportunity to ask questions. Parents are given an opportunity to meet, and speak to 
the teachers at a parent orientation for all grade levels at the start of the school year. This includes meeting with all service 
providers and content area teachers who explain their programs and share information with all parents. Throughout the 
school year, we offer workshops to all parents that include many subject areas, such as: Math, Art, ELL, Reading and Writing as 
well as other topics. 
 Parents are invited to our award ceremony, ceremonies and events that take place at Forest Elementary. Our Parent 
Coordinator makes sure that all parents receive information about everything happening here at P.S. 71. Information is also 
offered and delivered in a variety of languages which greatly benefits the parents of ELLs. Parents are also invited to attend our 
monthly PA meetings, where they are given every opportunity to voice their concerns and questions.  In addition, we have a 
website where information is posted and updates.  This website translates all this information to all our families that speak 
other languages. 
    We have many social activities that involve all parents such as Family Movie Night, Family Night, Family Harvest Night, 
Family Literacy Night, Family Math Night and a variety of other social events. 
   
 
    Parents attend  school trips. Parents of ELLs also have their own trips that are set up by the parent coordinator and 
administration. At PS 71 there is an adult ESL program available to all parents. This addresses the needs of our parents because 
they are given an opportunity to learn the English language and become proficient and so they can better support their 
children academically. 
 
    Here at P.S. 71 we make every attempt to send parents information, letters, flyers, calendars, and school newsletters to 
keep them involved in the Forest Elementary family. We also support and involve our parents during parent-teacher 
conferences by offering translators and translation services offered by the DOE.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Indiana Soto, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 71 uses a variety of data to assess our schools written translation and oral interpretation needs. The Home 
Language Surveys at registration are used not only to identify possible ELLs, but also to keep track of what the 
preferred language of communication is for parents at our school. This is identified in Part III of the HLIS forms. 
We also use the Student Emergency Contact cards (blue cards) to gather this data if needed. ATS reports such as 
RPOB and Report of Preferred Languages, parent surveys and teacher surveys (collected by class) are also ways 
we collect data on parents' preferred languages. Using HLIS surveys completed upon student registration (as well 
as the Emergency Blue Cards), we identified the main language groups in P.S. 71 to include English, Cantonese, 
Spanish, Arabic, Polish and Albanian. There is also a small representation of speakers of Urdu and Chinese.  

ATS provides us with helpful data and reports in order to assess the language needs of parents. We use the RPOB 
report which helps us group languages and the numbers needed when we must distribute and send information 
home (such as flyers, letters, and notifications). The RHLA report also gives us data regarding home languages. 
Class surveys are also taken and collected before report cards are distributed in which teachers keep a list of what 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

language both report cards and information needs to be sent home. A list of request for translators for parent-
teacher meetings by parents is also kept. This data is then sent down to the main office and the pupil accounting 
secretary compiles a list for future reference.  

For Special Education students, P.S. 71 may use current IEPs as data to identify the language spoken and written 
by the parents. This is also noted by both the child's teacher and the guidance counselor. Our Parent Coordinator 
also assists with compiling data regarding the language needs of parents. 

In order to ensure that all parents are provided with appropriate and timely information in a language they can 
understand, P.S. 71 makes every effort to use any and all translation services available, both written and oral. Our 
school keeps a written list of translators available at our school in our Parent Information Case (EPIC). We 
currently have Spanish, Arabic, Polish and Albanian translators in our building. For all other languages, we use the 
Translation Unit offered by the DOE.  

Upon examination of the CEP, Home Language Surveys, and RPOB report, we then identify the presence of 
qualified written and oral translators for each of the languages in the school. Specifically, we have many 
translators for Spanish. We have 9 teachers, 4 paraprofessionals, 6 school aides, one social worke and one 
guidance counselor who can translate Spanish. For Arabic, we have one teacher who can translate for our school 
community. We have one teacher on staff who can translate Polish. We also have one teacher and one school 
aide who can translate Albanian.  

When we have no staff members who can translate the other languages, we use the Department of Education’s 
translation service hotline for parent-teacher conferences and meetings with parents (such as IEP meetings or 
behavior/academic meetings). We also use the DOE website which has a lot of information and letters translated 
into a large variety of languages. The internet is also used for written translations on a case-by-case basis. We use 
GOOGLE Translation to tranlate notices and letters for parents that we send home. We have a full-time bilingual 
(English/Spanish) parent coordinator who ensures that flyers and surveys are distributed in the appropriate home 
languages. She makes every effort to assist and guide the parents with support in their home languages. In some 
cases, we also have parent volunteers who can also help with translation services. In summary, P.S. 71 ensures 
that all parents are provided with information in a language they can understand.

In case of an emergency, we will use any on site translator available. Our parent coordinator and many of our teachers 
are fully bilingual in Spanish. We also have a Polish speaking teacher and an Arabic speaking para professional. For any 
other language whom we do not have a translator for we will use the DOE translation unit. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During staff meetings and faculty conferences, all staff members are made aware of the variety of translation services 
available to them and the parents of our students. Each member of our staff is given a memo with the phone number 
of the DOE Translation Unit that they may use at any time. During Parent-Teacher conferences the staff is informed of 
the extensions to call in order to get translation services if they need to utilize it. They receive this information during 
grade level meetings, in the form of a memo and an email. Translation information is shared and distributed often, 
and the Parent Coordinator keeps the staff updated as well. There is a Parent Notification Bulletin Board that is 
updated with a variety of notices in a variety of languages. There are also flyers and New York City information on the 
counter in our main office also available to the parents in several languages. Our two guidance counselors and school

psychologist keep parent informational flyers in any languages available. Parents are able to take these flyers home 
for reference. 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

P.S. 71 provides each parent whose primary language is a covered language, and who requires language assistance 
services with written notification of their rights regarding translation and interpretation services in the appropriate 
covered languages, and instructions on how to obtain such services. 

P.S. 71 posts in a conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance, a sign in each of the covered languages 
indicating the office/room where a copy of such written notification can be obtained. 

The P.S. 71 safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language assistance services are 
not prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers. 

If at P.S. 71, the parents of more than 10% of the children at such school speak a primary language that is neither 
English nor a covered language, we shall obtain from the Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation into such 
language of the signage and forms required pursuant to this section, and shall post and provide such forms in 
accordance with this section. 

The Department of Education’s website shall provide information in each of the covered languages concerning the 
rights of parents to translation and interpretation services and how to access such services. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school uses Parent Surveys, Polls, and discussions at PA meetings on a regular basis to gather feedback from 
parents on the quality and availability of our school's translation and parent communication services. Each school year 
parents are sent home a form and surveys to ask what their preferred method of communcation is and what language 
they would prefer that communication in. Parents at PA meetings (as well as the PA president) also give feedback to 
the administration about their satisfaction regarding translated communications and is properly noted. Many Spanish 
and Arab speaking members of our school community have expressed an interest in even more availability of 
translations in both written and oral form and we have taken steps to ensure this happens, as our Arabic community 
has grown. We have already sent home invitations and tear-off slips to parents in both Arabic and Spanish for a 
variety of Parent events (Parent Orientation, Parent Meetings, ESL Classes for Parents, etc) and use Google Translate 
to satisfy this need in some of the other lower incidence languages. In the future, we may consider forming a focus 
group of parents that represent various cultures and languages in order to gather more feedback for our school.
