Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Middle school education at IS 237 will emphasize the social, emotional, educational, and physical needs of our school 
community. It will strive to provide a safe and secure environment conducive to the exploration of each individual's 
potential. Our focus is on the journey as well as the destination. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Rachel Carson Intermediate School resides in the heart of Flushing with a program designed to meet the needs of 
students in grades 6, 7, and 8. It is a barrier free school serving a large special education population with a wide 
variety of physical, learning, and/or emotional disabilities. IS 237 is a Title I school in which 100% of its students 
receive free lunch. Our school population reflects the wide diversity of cultures, languages, and customs of the 
surrounding community.  

In the media, we often hear of the need for tolerance in our communities. Our school has embraced a higher 
standard. Acceptance and respect for the practices and beliefs of others is what we impart to youngsters. We work 
hard to promote the social/emotional growth of our students in a supportive environment which is conducive to 
learning and have been successful in this area. During the 2016-17 school year, we introduced an initiative called 
Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) to staff and students in grades 6 and 7. Due to its success, it was 
expanded to be school wide in the 2017-18 and will continue into the 2018-19 school year. Other initiatives which 
address the students' social/emotional well being include: the Teacher-Parent Home Visit Program, use of the 
Resiliency Survey, Sanford Harmony, Beautiful Me, Beyond Differences, and Citizen of the Month. While we face the 
multitude of behavioral issues commonly encountered in other middle schools in New York City and across the 
country, incidents of prejudice are not among them.  

The vision for Rachel Carson Intermediate School 237 is reflective of the key elements which drove the decision to 
provide early adolescent students a place of their own within the organizational structure of school systems during 
the 1930’s. Delivery of challenging, rigorous content area instruction is certainly crucial but not the only responsibility 
of any educational institution. At all levels, students bring age related issues with them when they enter school each 
day. From separation problems during students’ earliest years in school to career decisions in later years, schools 
must be mindful of a lot more than the curriculum. Middle schools in particular face the significant challenge of 
serving clients who are working their way through the trials and tribulations of adolescent years.  

Under Equity and Excellence, Algebra for All and College Access for All we will continue in our efforts to meet the 
needs of our school and community populations. Staff development throughout the school year will support these 
initiatives. All students are challenged by Next Generation Learning Standards delivered by highly trained teachers. 
Academic goals link standards to instruction which in turn is delivered using child centered, skill based instructional 
techniques. Rigorous content area instruction encourages development of critical thinking skills and serves as a 
vehicle to promote investigative thought. Learning in each specific subject area is broadened to take place across the 
content areas. Further, we not only want students to learn, we want them to learn how to learn. Therefore, to 
increase the likelihood of success as they face more challenging material in middle school and beyond, we, along with 
the support of parents, strive to impart organizational skills and sound study habits.  

Integrated within the delivery of cognitive materials are a host of affective skills intended to guide youngsters to 
become independent, productive citizens within our multicultural society. Toward that end we strive to teach 
students to be respectful and aware of the needs of others, accept responsibility for their own actions, be good 
listeners and effective communicators, develop decision making skills, deal with anger, set personal goals, and 
become problem solvers. As indicated above, a number of initiatives have been undertaken to support students' 
social/emotional growth. 

Central to the achievement of our goals in both the cognitive and affective domains is the underlying design of 
class/teacher programs at IS 237. The program model allows for smaller settings within the larger school community 
with teams of teachers (representing the different content areas) having common scheduled periods which facilitate 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

the sharing of best practices on a regular basis. This model is at the core of a supportive environment which fosters 
incoming 6th graders’ acclimation to secondary school and better allows teachers to address the needs of all 
students.  

Our instructional program is enhanced by a variety of planned programs and collaborations for the benefit of our 
students, parents, and community. The programs enumerated below also assist us in addressing the Framework for 
Great Schools:

at IS 237. 

In sum, the vision outlined above guides us in preparing our students for an increasingly complex world. It has been 
reduced to a succinct statement of our mission. (Middle school education at IS 237 will emphasize the social, 
emotional, educational, and physical needs of our school community. It will strive to provide a safe and secure 
environment conducive to the exploration of each individual's potential. Our focus is on the journey as well as the 
destination.)  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school has a culturally diverse student population which is microcosm of New York City. Based on Home Language 
Surveys, more than thirty (30) different languages are spoken in the homes of our students. We face a significant 
challenge in the advancement of English language skill acquisition due to the diminished dependence on English in the 
local community. Evidence of this is all around us. The preponderance of commercial signs in the downtown area 
which provide general information and advertising material are not written in English. Some establishments only offer 
written material in languages other than English. In our efforts to address these issues, we will continue to offer 
English as a New Language (ENL) program requiring changes in instruction, program, and staffing requirements. 
Therefore , language acquisition is a significant focus. 

We also have a large special education population with students having a variety of physical, emotional, and learning 
disabilities. A site supervisor oversees the administration of this program. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the past school year we have endeavored to address all Frameworks for Great Schools. The Frameworks 
transcend subject areas and are at the foundation of planning and instruction. This year we will continue in this 
manner with particular focus on the Framework addressing collaborative teachers. 

There are a number of curriculum initiatives, collaborations, and programs which have been built into the 
instructional program over the years to encourage rigorous instruction. While we view rigorous instruction as a 
common element in all lessons and are encouraged by our success in this area, we will seek to further support 
instructional goals by promoting a variety of collaborative opportunities. These include programming common 
meeting times for teachers, co-teaching models, ENL support, Teacher Inquiry Teams as well as others described 
throughout this document. We see teacher collaboration as a key element in raising the level of rigorous instruction. 
Teachers across the curriculum areas receive training and collaborate in developing sound questioning techniques and 
employing the curriculum initiative known as Written and/or Verbal Evidence (WAVE). With respect to rigorous 
instruction, there are debate and math team opportunities. In assignments and independent work students are called

upon to analyze and draw conclusions. Science classes expose students to a challenging STEM science curriculum and 
social studies teachers challenge their students within the Passport to Social Studies curriculum. In sum, rigorous 
instruction is an ongoing focus which is supported in an atmosphere of collaboration among professionals. 

In addition to the cognitive domain, we at IS 237, are very concerned with the affective domain. We have met with 
considerable success in this area. In fact, we see the challenge of addressing citizenship and the social development of 
our adolescents as a significant part of our role. When students leave IS 237, we want them to be contributors to 
society and, therefore, extend effort and resources to create and maintain a supportive environment. Toward that 
end, teacher and student programs enable them to spend most of their day in a smaller environment within the 
school. Teachers see the same set of classes. They get to know their students well, have opportunities to share best 
practices, and develop support strategies for students with their team. As indicated above, we use PBIS as a support 
system model. As a multicultural urban middle school we certainly face the normal trials and tribulations of dealing 
with more than a thousand adolescents under one roof. However, evidence of the development of a supportive 
environment is the fact that, while conflicts do occur, we have not had a single student suspension relating to any 
racial or bias issue. Students are guided beyond the standard of tolerance and develop acceptance of different 
cultures. 

Referenced above are three Frameworks in which we have made significant progress (Collaborative Teachers, 
Rigorous Instruction, and Supportive Environment). Frameworks for Great Schools also include, Effective School 
Leadership and Strong Family-Community Ties. We have and continue to work to be successful in these areas. 
Throughout the year teachers attend and/or conduct numerous staff development and training sessions. Parents are 
part of the team working toward student success. They are kept aware of academic coursework, goings on with 
students and within the school, and are invited to attend relevant workshops aligned to their needs or interests. 
Finally, this is all put together, assessed, and revised by an effective school leadership.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
There are a number of strategies which have been introduced and refined over the years which we believe are central 
to our strength of providing rigorous instruction at IS 237. Among them are an emphasis on critical thinking skills, 
sound questioning techniques, and the use of WAVE (Written and/or Verbal Evidence). Administratively, classes are 
organized in clusters so that groups of classes are seen by the same set of teachers allowing those teachers to share 
best practices in meeting the academic (as well as social/emotional) needs of students and thus support rigorous 
instruction.  

Various data sources, which are summarized below, provide evidence of our efforts in the area of rigorous instruction. 

 

In the 2015-16 Quality Review, Rigorous Instruction at IS 237 was rated well developed (1.1 and 2.2) and 
proficient (1.2) with the average metric score of 4.49. 

  On the 2017 ELA exam 50% of all students attained level 3 or 4 which compares favorably by 3% to the 

previous year but unfavorably to the district where the rate of students achieving at a level of 3 or 4 was 55%. 
Nevertheless, given that more than 20% our student population are English Language Learners, we were 
encouraged by the results. Significant subgroups fared well with the subgroup Students with Disabilities 
seeing an increase in the percent of students attaining levels 3 or 4 (16% in 2017 vs 14% in 2016) and the 
subgroup English Language Learners scoring at a low level but about the same year to year. 

  On the 2017 NYS Math Test, 61% of all students attained a performance level 3 or 4. This compares favorably 

to the district but represented a decrease of 3% from the previous year. With respect to the subgroups 
Students with Disabilities and English Language Learners, the percent of students attaining level 3 or 4 were 
respectively 24% and 44% in 2017 compared to 23% and 49% in 2016. 
Students performing at a level 3 or 4 on the 2017 NYS Science Test was 64% in 2017 compared to 66% in 
2016. The two aforementioned subgroups also experienced a decrease in the percent of students attaining 
level 3 or 4. 

 

  Regarding NYS Accountability in the area of English Language Arts, all groups with the exception of Limited 

English Proficient students made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP). In the area of math, all groups made AYP. In 
the area of science, all groups with the exception of Hispanic or Latino made AYP. 

Based on analysis of the data and observations of the professional staff, the School Leadership Team has determined 
that mathematics should continue as a major focus and that resources should be allocated accordingly.

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students will demonstrate improved proficiency in mathematics by embarking on the Algebra for All 
element of the DOE’s Equity and Excellence for All initiative and employing ambitious intellectual practices consistent 
with rigorous instructional techniques intended to deepen students’ conceptual understanding and problem solving 
skills as evidenced by an increase of 5% in the number of students successfully attaining proficiency on the NYS Algebra I 
Regents examination.

Our efforts in this area are to seek parent involvement consistent with The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). 
Parents are seen as partners in the instructional program and the accomplishment of our goals. There are any number 
of venues in which administrators and teachers have opportunities to enhance or clarify parents' understanding of the 
rigorous instructional program. Some provide information on a monthly basis from September 2018 through June 
2019 while others are scheduled periodically throughout the school year. These include workshops, regular PTA 
meetings, School Leadership Team (SLT) meetings, orientations, parent teacher conferences, and individually 
scheduled meetings. Further, regular quarterly publications are planned: The Rachel Carson Newsletter, Science 
Matters, Special EDition, and bulletins will serve to provide information to parents about instructional as well as 
administrative matters. 

The key personnel are administrators, guidance counselors, and teachers. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
RESOURCES 

• Appropriate funding sources made available to Mrs. Friedman will be used for administrators, special education site 
supervisor, teachers, paraprofessionals, parent coordinator, outside service providers, and network support 
specialists to implement this plan from the beginning of the school year to the point at which success will be assessed 
in June 2019. 

• Curriculum related materials 

• Administration to monitor progress in implementing Action Plan items. 

• Teachers employ Action Plan items to work toward gaol. 

• Administrators, guidance counselors, teachers engage outside service providers (including Field Support Center 
personnel), initiatives, and programs along with any associated training and professional development. 

• Engage a bilingual guidance counselor to address adolescent issues which add to the challenges ENL students face.  

• Translation services provided to support ELL students and families.  

• Hardware, software, tech support 

SCHEDULING SUPPORT 

• Implement a programming model to facilitate rigorous instruction consistent with the establishment and 
maintenance of a supportive learning environment. The design of the IS 237 program creates a small setting within 
the school making for a more personal experience for students and teachers. Teachers have an opportunity to meet 
and share best practices and successful approaches with individual students. 

• Programming of special education classes to provide opportunities to share best practices in content area 
instruction. 

• Provide support instruction/services (guidance, AIS). Before and after school programs provide opportunities for 
special education or general education core subject teachers to address ELA skills and test taking techniques.

• Teacher teams assess needs and develop strategies to support instruction during small group and ENL classes.  

• Create push in and pull out (leveled) ENL classes.  

• Classes to be organized for ENL students which employ a collaborative team teaching model to fortify instruction 
with additional classroom teacher resources. Such classes will benefit from services from both an experienced 
language arts and ENL teachers.  

• After school programs led by ENL or general education core subject teachers to address ELA skills, test taking 
techniques, and provide assistance with homework in small group settings. 

• Provide professional development for teachers to advance strategies which address content area instructional 
techniques for ENL students by principal, AP’s, teachers, and outside resources.  

• Students identified and provided with AIS services. Students assigned to small groups for targeted assistance in 
math skills appearing on the NYS Math assessment .

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We have met with much success in creating an atmosphere that is safe and conducive to learning. Providing a 
supportive environment in which rigorous instructional techniques can be successfully delivered is crucial to a sound 
educational program. At the root of our success in this area is that we remain mindful of the role envisioned when the 
middle school model, intended to address the unique needs of the adolescent along with his/her social/emotional 
well-being, was introduced almost ninety (90) years ago. While there are a number of things we are proud of in this 
area, there is always the need to remain vigilant in maintaining a supportive environment. As indicated in the 
Overview section of this CEP, the school and the community are culturally diverse. At IS 237, a standard greater than 
tolerance of others has been taught. We seek and have been successful in promoting respect for one another. 
Although we face the many behavioral issues encountered in other middle schools incidents of prejudice are not 
among them as evidenced by the fact that not one suspension had that as a cause. 

Indicated below are data which have been used to focus our direction in the direction of providing a supportive 
environment. 

  On the 2015-16 Quality Review (3.4) IS 237 was rated Well Developed 
  According to the 2016-17 NYC School Quality Guide, students’ responses indicated the following perceptions:  

o  72% had positive views regarding safety, 
o  59% responded positively about personal attention and support 

  The 2016-17 School Quality Guide indicates the percentage of students with 90%+ attendance was 89%. 
  The average number of suspensions per month in 2017-18 was 3. 

Based on this analysis and internal discussions, the School Leadership Team has determined that resources should be 
allocated to maintain and improve upon our efforts to provide a supportive environment for all students seeing 
improved attendance as a reflection of these efforts. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, support will be generated so as to enhance a school culture where students feel safe and supported as 
evidenced by a decrease of 8% in the number of reported occurrences of lateness to AM homeroom during the school 
year based on the 2018-19 Attendance and Lateness Data report. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          21 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Our efforts in this area are to seek parent involvement consistent with The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). 
Parents are seen as partners in the instructional program and the accomplishment of our goals. Parents will sense our 
efforts in maintaining a supportive environment as we communicate with them about matters relating to the 
instructional program. Some information is passed along on a monthly basis from September 2018 through June 2019 
while other information is communicated periodically throughout the school year. Venues include workshops, regular 
PTA meetings, School Leadership Team (SLT) meetings, orientations, parent teacher conferences, and individually 
scheduled meetings. Further, regular quarterly publications are planned: The Rachel Carson Newsletter, Science 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24 

 

Matters, Special EDition, and bulletins will serve to provide information to parents about instructional as well as 
administrative matters. 

The key personnel are administrators, guidance counselors, and teachers. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
RESOURCES : 
 • Administrators to monitor progress in implementing, data gathering, and assessing Action Plan items. 

• Teachers to employ multiple entry point strategies, scaffolding, and emphasize literary experiences in planning and 
instruction. 

• Administrators, guidance counselors, and teachers communicate with outside partnerships 

enumerated in Part 3a above 

• Guidance counselors very much involved the initiatives outlined in the Action Plan to assist in providing a supportive 
environment.  

• Principal, APs, teachers and outside resources (including Field Support Center personnel) to plan and conduct 
professional development relating top Action Plan items 

• Engage a bilingual guidance counselor to address adolescent issues which add to the challenges ENL students face.  

• Translation services provided to support ELL students and families.  

SCHEDULING SUPPORT 

• Implement a programming model conducive to building and maintaining a supportive environment. The design of 
the IS 237 program enhances teacher interaction by including common meeting times to evaluate data, not only to 
make decisions regarding instruction, and develop strategies to promote critical thinking skills but to also provide an 
environment which support teachers and students.  

- Embark on a Teacher-Parent Home Visit Program 

- Bring programs to IS 237 which support the social/emotional growth of our adolescent students (See Action Plan). 

• Programming of special education classes to provide opportunities to share best practices in content area 
instruction and, as a result build a supportive network for disabled youngsters. 

• Provide support instruction/services (guidance, AIS). Before and after school programs provide opportunities for 
special education or general education core subject teachers to address ELA skills and test taking techniques.  

• Create an ENL instructional program geared to the five English proficiency levels. Students at each level will be 
provided with different models and amounts of instruction based on their identified Proficiency level.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          25 

 

• Classes to be organized based on our ENL model which employs a collaborative team teaching model to fortify 
instruction with additional classroom teacher resources. Such classes will benefit from services from both 
experienced language arts and ENL teachers.  

• After school programs led by ENL or general education core subject teachers to address ELA skills, test taking 
techniques, and provide assistance with homework in small group settings.  

• Students identified and provided with AIS services. Students assigned to small groups for targeted assistance in 
language arts and skills appearing on the NYS ELA assessment.  

• Provide professional development for teachers to advance strategies which address content area instructional 
techniques for ENL and special needs students by principal, AP’s, teachers, and outside resources

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Collaboration among teachers is an important part of the educational process and program at IS 237. Evidence of the 
formal aspects of this commitment are indicated below. Additionally, teachers collaborate on an informal basis 
(facilitated by teachers’ programs). We view our commitment to promoting collaboration among teachers as a 
significant strength of our instructional program. Among established policies and initiatives which promote 
collaboration are the following: 

 

IS 237 has made a commitment to participate in Algebra for All. This involves teacher training followed by 
trained teachers sharing the appropriate content and techniques with their colleagues. 

  Teacher programs are constructed in such a way that groups of the various subject area teachers teach the 

same classes. Common preparation time is provided so as to allow collaboration regarding best practices, 
specific needs of individual students, timing of units, interdisciplinary endeavors, etc. 
Inquiry Teams are formed  
Interdisciplinary Teams are formed 

 
 

Notwithstanding the items indicated above highlighting what we have done to demonstrate our commitment to the 
benefits of collaboration on the instructional program, the data below will serve to guide us as we move forward: 

  The 2015-16 School Quality Snapshot indicates that 76% of teachers responded positively to questions 

regarding their perceptions in the area of Collaborative Teachers. This compares unfavorably to the district 
(84%) and the city (84%). These results are about the same as the previous year. 

  67% of teachers at IS 237 responded that they have opportunities to work productively with colleagues as 

indicated on the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot. This compares unfavorably 87% citywide. 

  The most recent Quality Review, in the area of teacher teams and leadership development (4.2) was rated 

proficient. 

  ELA results in 2017 compared unfavorably to the district with respect to the percent of students scoring at a 

performance level of 3 or 4 (50% vs 55%). 

Based on this analysis the School Leadership Team has determined that resources will be allocated to step up 
opportunities to promote and enhance teacher collaboration in order to improve language arts skill levels and thus 
improve ELA scores on the NYS Assessment. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          27 

 

By June 2019, with the support of additional collaboration opportunities, greater success will be achieved in teachers’ 
classrooms as evidenced by an increase of 5% in the number of students achieving a performance level of 3 or 4 on the 
NYS ELA Assessment.A Assessment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Several positive aspects/strengths of the instructional program as well as the elements directed at nurturing the 
growth and development of our middle school students have been outlined in the sections addressing the Framework 
elements relating to rigorous instruction, a supportive environment, and collaboration. None of those occur without a 
strong school leader. Given the many successes we have achieved, the School Leadership Team lists our current 
administration under the guidance of Mrs. Friedman to be one of our very significant strengths. 

An analysis of the data relating Effective School Leadership reveals the following: 

  More than 90% of parents responded positively to questions about Effective School Leadership. 
  Approximately 56% of teachers responded that their perception is that they have a great deal of influence 
over such things as selecting/developing instructional materials, or school policies relating to standards of 
student behavior. 

  78% of teachers agreed that the principal makes expectations clear with respect to instructional goals and 

communicates a clear vision for the school. 

  Overall, 78% of parents and teachers responded positively to questions about effective school leadership. This 

compares unfavorably to both the district (86%) and the city (87%). 

  Under the current administration the passing rate for the four (4) core subject areas is 95%. 

The foregoing analysis has led the School Leadership Team to focus on the overall perceptions of parents and teachers 
with respect to their responses on the Learning Environment Survey. We will, therefore, allocate resources intended 
to promote effectiveness in school leadership in order to accomplish the goal indicated below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, systems and structures will be implemented to support and improve perceptions among teachers, 
paraprofessionals, and parents regarding Effective School Leadership as evidenced by a 3% increase in positive 
responses on the Learning Environment Survey (School Quality Snapshot).

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How  will  your  school  engage  parents/families  and  support  their  understanding  of  Effective  School  Leadership  and 
strategies  to  promote  parent  leadership  and  engagement  in  order  to  support  their  children  at  home?  Include  the 
timeline and identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
All connections with parents are the result of efforts taken by the principal to include them as partners in the process 
of educating their children. Our efforts in this area are to seek parent involvement consistent The Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA). The methods and venues which facilitate parent/family engagement are a window to witnessing 
and understanding effective school leadership. Ways in which parents connect with the school are enumerated in the 
Action Plans provided in Sections 5A-5C. More specifically, these include workshops, regular PTA meetings, School 
Leadership Team (SLT) meetings, orientations, parent teacher conferences, and individually scheduled meetings. 
Further, regular quarterly publications are planned: The Rachel Carson Newsletter, Science Matters, Special EDition, 
and bulletins will serve to provide information to parents about instructional as well as administrative matters. 

The key personnel involved are administrators, guidance counselors, and teachers. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc.

A strong connection to parents and the community has been a long term commitment at IS 237. As a result, quite a 
number of well received initiatives have been introduced over the years many of which are ongoing. Parents are seen 
as partners in the instructional program and the accomplishment of our goals. The school leadership endeavors to 
engage parents as partners in the instructional program by designing and offering interaction between the school and 
families. The narrative offered in Section 4 offers contextual information about our school and the surrounding 
community outlining some of the challenges we face and work hard to overcome.  

As mentioned throughout this report, a variety of endeavors have been introduced to spur increased parent 
involvement in academics and activities. The following interventions are central to the success we have enjoyed in our 
desire to include parents as our partners in the educational process. They include parent workshops on a variety of 
topics, periodic publications (The Rachel Carson Newsletter, Science Matters, Special EDition), Saturday ENL 
instruction for parents, arts programs for parents, translation services, orientation programs, and a new program 
known as the Teacher-Parent Home Visit Program. 

The 2016-17 NYC School Quality Snapshot revealed that 80% responded positively to questions about Strong Family-
Community Ties. This compares favorably to the 2015-16 positive response rate of 77% on the Learning Environment 
Survey but unfavorably to the positive response rates in this area for the district (85%) and the city (88%). Therefore, 
our successes to date notwithstanding, the School Leadership Team has decided we should continue to allocate time, 
personnel, and resources to plan, in consultation with the Parent Coordinator and PTA representatives, parent 
engagement activities. 

In order to address the Goal below, the School Leadership Team will allocate resources to maintain and further 
develop relationships between members of the school and local communities.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, school leaders will allocate resources to enhance Strong Family and Community Ties by engaging with 
parents in the community to support district and school goals as well as promote the social/emotional well-being of 
students as evidenced by monitoring individual progress among students whose parent(s) have participated in the 
Teacher-Parent Home Visit Program and observing an increase in the average report card grades in core subjects over 
the school year.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers participate in decision making processes working collaboratively to constantly improve the instructional 
program by examining various curricula, discussing assessments (test formats, outputs, alignments with standards, 
data provided, report formats) and deciding which assessments meet our needs. For example, teacher Inquiry Teams 
explore ways to inform change for the purpose of improving assessment and instruction 

Teacher participation in the decision making process is supported by professional development which is employed in 
a variety of formats: administrator-teacher, teacher-teacher, outside source-teacher and in a variety of areas: 
instructional initiatives, assessment, curriculum initiatives (ie Algebra for All), social/emotional well being. One 
example of the teacher decision making process resulted in the introduction of the iReady Assessment system which 
offers a standards based program that includes a diagnostic assessment to obtain baseline data relative to meeting

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. IS 237, in compliance with The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is responsible 
for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by 
actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

IS 237 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

●  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement

o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.

We will conduct a Saturday academy for three classes of ELLs. The total period of instruction 
for each class is three hours. Classes will be held on Saturdays beginning October 2018 through 
May 2019, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM, for a total of twenty-two sessions: October 6, 13, 20, 
27      November 3, 10, 17     December  1, 8, 15         January  5, 12, 26          February  2, 
9,             March 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 
April 6, 13 
Class size will be kept at a maximum of twenty students per teacher. 
The assistant principal and participating teachers will maintain accurate attendance records via 
Google Spreadsheets and contact the parents of absentee students. 
 
The Saturday academy will select Newcomer ELL students as well as all ELL students that 
received a level 1 or 2 on their NYS English Language Arts exam. We will use data from the 
EDAT tool, 2018 NYSESLAT results and NYSITELL results to target specific areas of need and 
to create flexible groupings based on students' areas of improvement.  Students will be 
administered a pre-assessment, benchmark assessment and a post assessment mirroring the 
NYSESLAT exam to monitor students' progress.   
Classes will be taught by certified ESL, English, and math teachers. Students will be broken into 
three class groups: grade 6, grade 7 and grade 8.  Each class will be rotated every 60 minutes 
between the three teachers.  A certified ESL teacher will provide ENL instruction focusing on 
listening and speaking activities, as well as building self-esteem, while a certified English 
teacher will provide instruction on improving reading and writing skills.  A certified math 
teacher will provide instruction with a focus on academic language.  The workbook, "Math" 
from Glencoe/McGraw-Hill and iReady will be purchased to help prepare students for the 2019 
NYS Math Exam.  The workbook, "Finish Line - NY ELLs", which reflects changes in the 
NYSESLAT,  will be purchased to help prepare students who will be taking the  NYSESLAT 
exam.   ESL, English and math teachers will rotate among groups every sixty minutes. They will 
focus on the four modalities of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Achieve3000 will be 
used to monitor student growth and grammar books will be used in conjunction with writing 
activities. Home language support will be provided through use of glossaries, multi-lingual word 
banks and texts, and translation via oral and technological.  General instructional supplies 
including bilingual dictionaries, charts, markers, notebooks, post-its and pencils will be 
purchased to support the Saturday Academy program for ELLs. 
Additionally, we will conduct morning classes for Newcomers twice a week for 30 minutes each 
day. Grade 7 and 8 Newcomer students (students that are new this school year) will be targeted 
for this morning program. Group size will be maintained at a maximum of twenty 
students.  Classes will be  held from October 2018 through April 2019 from 7:25-7:55 AM for a 
total of 50 sessions (25 weeks) as follows:

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
A certified ESL teacher will provide instruction in ENL, literacy through the content areas, and 
develop activities to promote reading comprehension. This morning program is designed to teach 
pre-reading comprehension that will help students improve in all content classes.   The 
Achieve3000 and i-Ready reading programs will be used support student growth. The programs 
provide web-based individual instruction from which data will be analyzed and used to group 
students according to their academic and linguistic needs. Achieve 3000 and I-Ready are 
research based and have been proven to improve reading comprehension.  They also will help 
prepare students for the 2019 NYSESLAT exam.

 All ESL, English and math teachers will receive ongoing professional development in the uses 
and applications of  Achieve 3000 and iReady,  programs already used with both our general and 
ELL populations.   The focus of ongoing professional development is for teachers to become 
informed about new functions the programs offer, to collaborate with other members in the 
department to analyze and focus on looking at the summative data and reflect on how  students 
progressed.  Together, teachers will look at what resources they can use to focus 
intervention.   Throughout the course of the year, teachers will monitor progress using 
Achieve3000 and iReady reports to ensure that students are meeting the target of completing the 
target of two Activities per week with a  first-try score of 75% or higher. Teachers will also 
analyze usage and performance reports to monitor students' progress.  Data from these reports 
will be used to monitor college and career readiness, Lexile Growth, and performance on 
standards.  Additionally, data from these reports will be used to target instruction for individual 
needs to positively impact the progress of ELL students. A minimum of four full day Achieve 
3000 professional development sessions will take place over the course of the school 
year. (Actual dates to be determined jointly by the school and Achieve 3000 staff developers as 
the year progresses.)   Professional development sessions will focus on enhanced applications of 
the program and on improved data tracking tools to help teachers better assess students' 
progress.  Similarly, iReady training will occur a minimum of four times during the school year 
(dates to be determined). Together, Achieve 3000 and iReady professional development will 
advance teachers' understanding of and ability to obtain and use data, which in turn will help 
them customize instruction to meet the needs of individuals and groups of students. Both 
programs also will provide teachers  with a broad range of pedagogical approaches aligned with 
Common Core Standards, that address the needs of ELLs and provide them access to content 
area learning.  
During teacher team meetings, ESL teachers inform content area teachers about effective 
strategies that may be implemented in subject classes and share best practices with 
colleagues.   Teachers also receive SMART Board, Skedula and other training in the use of 
technology. 
The ESL supervisor, ESL, English and math teachers will attend District 25 sponsored 
workshops conducted by Maryann Cucchiara around strategies for deconstructing complex texts

Begin description here:            
Parent engagement activities include daytime and evening workshops conducted by bilingual 
guidance counselors in such areas as the high school application process and issues related to the 
New York State Testing Program (10/2, 11/6, 12/4.)  Parents will be invited to attend Saturday 
Academy Classes and learn side-by-side with their children on 10/27, 11/17, 12/15, 1/12, 3/9. 
Parents will be notified of upcoming workshops and activities through translated flyers and oral 
translation during the identification process for Newcomer ELL students. Our ELL Coordinator 
and Parent Coordinator welcome incoming parents and conduct the orientation, and meet with 
each new student and his/her family.  Throughout the school year, translated monthly calendars 
are sent home as well as  quarterly newsletters to inform parents of important dates for Parent-
Teacher Conferences and workshops. Skedula workshops and informational meetings facilitated 
by I.S. 237 administration, parent coordinator,  and staff serve as a way for parents of ELL 
students to ask questions, engage in discussion, and share their child's progress.  Through 
Skedula, parents receive individual student data, progress reports, and homework assignments 
that can be translated into various languages.  In addition, our school has teachers, 
paraprofessionals,  and support staff that are fluent in Mandarin, Spanish, Cantonese and other 
languages.  When a parent who speaks one of these languages calls or visits the school, we are 
able to communicate with them in the home language through these native speakers.  For oral 
translation for a language that is not available, we use the Translation and Interpretation 
Unit.  During all school events, translators are hired to provide parents support in their native 
languages.   
During weekly DOE designated parent engagement time, (2:20-3:00 PM every Tuesday), 
bilingual staff members, including paraprofessionals, will conduct outreach activities (telephone 
calls, emails, online contact) to keep parents of ELLs informed about their child's progress. Each 
staff member involved will memorialize outreach efforts through the use of a contact log which 
will be maintained by the ENL/Bilingual teachers. Our parent coordinator will work closely 
with  District 25 parent engagement staff and with community based liaisons to arrange 
workshops and learning opportunities for families new to our school community.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  Teachers regularly have an assessment at the beginning and end of each unit. We use assessment programs that are aligned 
to the NYS Next Generation Learning Standards. Teachers then use this data to guide differentiated instruction and planning 
for ENLs. We also use the results of the NYS ELA, math, science, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to guide our instructional planning for 
ENLs as we look at which modality the students are strongest or weakest in from the NYSESLAT. We do this by analyzing the 
EDAT report and use this data to make instructional decisions, such as groupings.In addition, we create teacher diagnostic 
tests and use the Achieve3000.com pre, interim and post tests to monitor student growth. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

 
We have many structures in place to support this effort.  In our Teams (which meet on Mondays and Tuesdays), we sit, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

share,  and analyze all the data collected from various reports (EDAT, NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data.) In addition, teachers bring 
student work samples to look at as a group and plan what other assessments and instruction might be valuable to our 
students. We have team discussions on what instructional practices that work best for different levels of ENL students. We 
analyze and use the results of these assessments to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the students.  All assessment 
data is collected and entered into  Google Docs. Our data analyst keeps this data updated on a regular basis and shares it with 
the staff after every unit. We then use the results and data to drive instruction and form groups of students that have similar 
areas of need. They are also good predictors of student performance in upcoming state exams as well as in the classroom. 
These results are used to differentiate and scaffold lessons in order to enhance teaching practices.  They are a primer 
for planning and preparation of lessons to meet each student’s individual learning needs.  They are also used for grouping 
within content areas and as a baseline for monitoring the progress of the students' educational gains throughout the school 
year.    
We run and analyze the EDAT report periodically (as well as looking at informal data collected from our teachers – examples: 
writing samples, Level Set from Achieve3000) reveals that ENLs generally have more difficulty with reading and writing 
components. ENL students’  listening and speaking skills are stronger overall (and seem to show the most growth at a faster 
pace), especially with ENLs who have been enrolled in school for more than one year.  We use this, and all data, to drive 
instruction. Teachers keep conference notes on the data for reference and grouping purposes. We analyze this data to see 
what areas we must focus on to help our ENL students. Our Data Specialist continues to collect all the information from the 
teachers and creates charts and graphs for continued reference. 
We also look at other factors, such as the students' attendance records and work together with our Pupil Accounting 
Secretary, attendance teacher, deans and guidance counselors to check on attendance, and holdover information. The ENL 
team meets with administrators and co-teachers to formulate a list of actions, small group instruction, and other 
interventions. We implement all strategies and modify, based on student needs.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The baseline/benchmark assessments that our school uses to identify progress and areas of need (listening, speaking, reading 
and writing) for our ENLs are: NYSITELL (baseline and areas of need), NYSESLAT (progress and areas of need), Achieve3000 
Level Set, pre, interim and post exams to check Lexile level growth and progress in reading. Also, we use the teachers’ 
classroom unit assessments. Teachers will then continue to use this data to guide instruction and planning for ENLs. 
Based on this data, we have identified the greatest area of need as being oral language. We have adjusted our instructional 
focus to include more learning tasks that provide opportunities for students to engage in class discussion on the content being 
taught. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The structures we have in place in order to address the interventions once the summative data has been gathered is that 
students are checked for progress and growth after each unit of instruction in order to see what the next plan of action should 
be. The teachers use the results and data to determine the progress ENL students have made and where students need to 
make more progress. We do this by reviewing the results of all assessments and analyze which sections the students seem to 
have the most difficulty with. Each child may have different results, so this is taken into consideration.  Once areas of concern 
have been identified, strategies are implemented to target specific areas of student need. 
As previously stated, we stay updated on students attendance records. We stay updated on potential long-term ENLs, referrals 
to special education, new special education placements, and NYSESLAT, ELA and math results. We discuss all of this within our 
ENL Team and continue to share any data collected. The ENL team meets with co-teachers to formulate a plan of action, such 
as small group Instruction. We implement all strategies and modify instruction based on student needs. Teachers are provided 
with Professional Development on data collecting and data analysis.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data from the NYSESLAT, NYS ELA and math exams are always used to evaluate and inform our ENL Programs.  We may 
use the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) which combines information from three ATS reports and creates information for us to 
analyze and use to make plans for our ENL programs. We also use the RLAT from ATS on a very regular and consistent 
basis.  We use it to analyze and evaluate all patterns across NYSESLAT modalities each year, and use the results to make 
instructional decisions (such as grouping). The results for the NYSESLAT modalities show that students are reaching high levels 
on the tests in the listening and speaking modalities and that in most cases their scores are being lowered by the results in the 
reading and writing modalities.  This demonstrates that the students are being successful at BICS and are ready to achieve 
comparable success in CALP.  Since more than 50 percent of our ENL students have 0 to 3 years of English language exposure, 
this is in line with the stages of language development. Teachers also analyze ELA  data to discover the particular needs of the 
students. 
Teachers model and apply various research-based practices which help ENL students extract meaning from reading so they are 
more able to write successfully. Teachers use many various ENL Methodologies such as W.A.V.E. (written and verbal 
instruction — this is an I.S. 237 initiative), differentiation, home language support, visuals, small group instruction, 
partnerships, scaffolding, color-coding information, technology, leveled questioning, and strong vocabulary support. Long 
sentences with difficult vocabulary, which are called "juicy sentences" are broken down using the “Deconstruct - Reconstruct 
Strategy”, mapping meaning to a text. Students are taught to break down and understand these sentences.  Word walls and 
personal word lists are kept for words which can be used for both comprehensions and in vocabulary development for 
writing.  Leveled word lists and leveled transitional phrases are also used for differentiation of writing instruction. Visuals are 
often used for lower level ENLs. Identifying language patterns and figurative expressions in writing samples give students the 
tools to understand what they read and to develop their vocabulary to improve their writing.  These strategies help students 
make the difficult transition from BICS to CALP and achieve greater success in their reading and writing.  This should greatly 
address the disparity between the results of ENL students in the listening and speaking, and reading and writing modalities. 
Students on all grade levels are provided with the Achieve3000 computer-based instructional program (for reading and 
writing), which establishes each student’s strengths and weaknesses and provides individualized instruction 
accordingly.  Students are assessed periodically and instruction is further revised.  Achieve3000 provides graphic organizers 
and worksheets which are useful for teachers to plan instruction for each student.  ENL teachers provide classroom teachers 
with assistance in planning to meet the needs of ELL students and also turnkey strategies from workshops. 
 Students receive test preparation for the ELA and NYSESLAT from the ENL and classroom teachers using teacher-developed 
materials and the practice questions provided by New York State. We provide instruction on different levels reflecting the 
question types on the new and different bands of the NYSESLAT. We also refer to the English as a Second Language Arts 
Standards from Engage NY as guidance for what is expected of our ENL students. 
Language development is encouraged by the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher through collaborative planning and 
instruction.  Together the teachers establish a low anxiety environment with comprehensible input, opportunities for the ENL 
learner to interact with peers and awareness of the stages of language acquisition.  Scaffolding activities and differentiated 
instruction encourage students to achieve greater language proficiency through modeling language, providing high-interest 
activities and partnerships foster development and risk-taking.   Students are also grouped at tables with native speakers of 
English in order to provide maximum exposure to English modeled by their peers.  (When possible.) A wide variety of 
assessments are used to gauge development across the four modalities and to drive further instruction within the Zone of 
Proximal Development through social interaction and academic content-based activities. Instruction is developed to meet the 
specific needs of our ENL population. Students receive additional support through differentiated instruction, as well as 
differentiated activities.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 At IS 237, we make every effort to ensure that a child's second language development is considered in all instructional 
decisions. We do this by working in teams. We have an ENL Team that consists of ENL teachers, classroom teachers with ENL 
students in their class, and our technology teacher and data specialist. This team collaborates with the administration and 
includes all teachers who work with ENLs. We have discussions about approaches to target the most critical needs of our ENL 
students while keeping language development as a key focus of all instructional decisions. Generally, we try to focus on one 
area of need at a time and create a plan together. Our ENL Team shares important data collected by other teams. As

previously stated, The ENL team meets with administrators and co-teachers to formulate a list of actions such as possible small 
group instruction or additional pre-teaching using the flipped classroom strategy via Google classroom. We implement all 
strategies and modify based on student needs. All teams are provided with Professional Development on data collecting and 
data analysis and implementation in order to make adjustments to programs as needed. 
Classroom teachers use research-based instruction that is differentiated and scaffolded for ENLs, collect data, monitor ongoing 
progress, and work with colleagues in making instructional decisions based on the data. Teachers share their findings of 
student performance in the classroom, as well as their expertise in the classroom content and grade-level skills. We maximize 
student potential by sharing insights about the student’s home life, family background, and interests. 
Our ENL teachers have expertise about language development, and how to use assessment tools and techniques, as well as 
how to use effective instructional practices for ENLs. As a result, we assure that the ENL teachers are included in the 
instructional decision-making process. Because of this knowledge, their roles include:  clarifying needs associated with second 
language acquisition, providing evidence for differences between learning differences and disabilities and modeling 
instructional strategies for classroom teachers, as well as assisting with assessments.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

All instruction for ENLs is delivered based on mandated minutes as per CR Part 154.2.  Instruction for ENLs has been 
aligned with the NYS Next Generation Learning Standards, and delivery of  ENL services is provided through a 
combination of standalone minutes and integrated minutes, We mostly use the push-in/co-teaching model, but also 
use pull-out ENL classes as necessary. All of this instruction is delivered in accordance with CR Part 154.2 and all 
mandates are followed. ENLs are grouped in classes according to their grade level and travel together in a group. 
Most ENL classes have more than one proficiency level, although occasionally we form a class of all Expanding or 
Commanding students in order to maximize scheduling.  Instruction is delivered using the Push-In/Co-Teaching model 
for the large majority of ENL students, especially students with Integrated minutes only.  Instruction is given mainly 
through the Reader's and Writer's workshop model following the NYS Next Generation Learning Standards and the 
curriculum. The classroom teacher and a licensed ENL teacher co-teach the mini lesson, using differentiated 
instruction and materials, and then students work in small groups where their areas of need are addressed. Within 
those groups, the ENL teacher focuses on ENL strategies and methodologies based on the level of the ENL students in 
the group. Integrated and Standalone minutes can be delivered within the classroom. A small number of Special 
Education students that are in various self-contained classes who are eligible for ENL services are pulled out into a 
small group in order to adhere to the students’ IEPs regarding group size and in order to maximize scheduling and 
small group/individualized instruction. The ENL special ed that is in either ICT or SETSS are placed into a pull-out ENL 
class in order to receive services. All service providers are licensed appropriately in order to provide and meet all 
mandates as necessary. We attempt to schedule our students correctly, following all mandates and using the ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide (updated in August 2018) as guidance. 
ENL students are grouped by grade level and are mostly homogeneously placed within the classroom. Scores on the 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT tests are used to determine program eligibility for each student.  Once program eligibility is 
determined, students are placed into designated classes on each grade level in order to facilitate the delivery of ENL 
services through various scheduling models.  Since there is a large number of ENL students on each grade level, more 
than one class on each grade has been designated as an ENL class.  There are four licensed/certified teachers serving 
the classes with the push-in model, four classroom teachers hold ESL certification that assists with meeting our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

mandates, and there is a minimal amount of pull-out instruction (only when necessary) for Entering/Emerging and 
some Special Education ENL  students.    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Based on parent requests on the HLIS, for the 2018-2019 school year,  I.S. 237 has opened two bilingual programs for 
grade 6 and grade 7.  
As per Part 154.2  the bilingual teachers will attend professional development that supports the education of 
ENL/Bilingual students, including co-teaching strategies and the integration of language and content area instruction. 
A minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers prescribed by CR Part 80 will be 
dedicated to language acquisition including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating 
language and content instruction for ENLs/Bilingual students and 50% of professional development will be given to 
Bilingual and ENL teachers. 
Ms. Huang, the Bilingual teacher will be teaching social studies in English and Mandarin to one class in grade 6 and 
one class in grade 7.  She will also be teaching Home Language Arts to both classes as well as English language arts 
and stand-alone ENL classes will be taught in English. Ms. Yeh, the math teacher with a Bilingual extension, will be 
teaching math in English and Mandarin to one class in grade 6 and one class in grade 7. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Our classes are scheduled by the administration. There is communication between the administration and ENL teachers 
ensuring that all programs are given their mandated amount of time.  This information is put into STARS by the school 
programmer who is to ensure that no conflicts have been made. 
 The administration assures that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels in 
each program by carefully aligning the teacher schedules with the schedules. Scheduling conflicts are avoided through 
collaboration with related service providers who also work with the ENL student population (i.e. speech services, occupational 
therapy, etc.). Our programs are push-in/co-teach, pull-out models and sixth-grade TBE are aligned with NYS Next Generation 
Standards with the required standalone minutes when necessary. Students enjoy maximum involvement in classroom 
activities as well as the support they need through ENL methodologies and differentiated instruction. Scaffolding, 
differentiation, and modeling are used on a regular basis. 
In the upcoming and current school year, all grades that are placed in the ENL and TBE programs are serviced as per part 154 
requirements: 
•   Entering students receive 180 minutes standalone ENL plus 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA for a total of 360 minutes. 
  •   Emerging students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes standalone or 
integrated ENL or any other content area. 
•   Transitional students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction plus 90 minutes standalone or integrated ENL or 
any other content area. 
•   Expanding Students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction. 
•   Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/other content area instruction. 
 
a. How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 below)? 
 Explicit ENL is delivered in the ENL program through collaborative planning and communication between the ENL and 
classroom teachers. ENL and classroom teachers of ENL students compare data, share ideas and plan for instruction. Reading 
and writing instruction is provided using the workshop model. Language development is encouraged by the classroom teacher 
and the ENL teacher through collaborative planning and instruction.  Together the co-teachers establish a low anxiety 
environment with comprehensible input, opportunities for the ENL learner to work in cooperative groups, to interact with 
peers and awareness of the stages of language acquisition.  Small groups targeting similar needs and levels, and differentiation 
of instruction is used on a daily basis. Scaffolding activities encourage students to achieve greater language proficiency 
through modeling language, providing high-interest activities and partnerships to foster language development and risk taking. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 A wide variety of assessment is used to assess development across the four modalities and to drive further instruction within 
the Zone of Proximal Development through social interaction and academic content-based activities.  Assessment drives 
instruction.  Informal assessments include portfolios, teacher observation, and teacher/student conferencing/next 
steps.  Formal assessments include NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, Achieve3000 as well as NYS ELA and math assessments where 
appropriate. Student needs are assessed and adjusted accordingly based on their performance. We engage our students in a 
wide variety of activities.  We support our students with visuals, demonstrations, and shared experiences.  Our ENL students 
listen, speak, read and write to enhance their success. Teachers target each student’s special needs and work with these 
students on a regular basis in order to build academic and language proficiency. 
Instruction is developed to meet the specific needs of our ENL population. Students receive additional support through our 
differentiated instruction and small, leveled groups. There are several implications for the school’s LAP and instruction.  New 
classes need to continue to be developed to address the specific needs of our students in each grade level, as described above. 
Professional development in ENL strategies/methodologies is provided to staff on a regular basis. All teachers will continue to 
emphasize reading and writing while incorporating our WAVE initiative. Content-based Vocabulary (domain specific) is 
emphasized on all grade levels. We sometimes add centers or stations that contain word games, vocabulary games, activity 
cards, picture dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries, as well as other language-related items. 
HLA is delivered in the TBE program by Ms. Huang in Mandarin for 180 minutes using bilingual books supplied by China Sprout. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
When ENL teachers push into a classroom during a content area lesson, the ENL teacher ensures that ENL students receive the 
same content area instruction through the use of ENL methodologies as described below.  The content area topic, materials, 
books, supplies, many visuals, an assistance of technology, and assignments are incorporated and adapted according to the 
students' levels of English language development (content-based). Bilingual dictionaries and many visuals are available, use of 
technology for home language support (such as Google translate or apps on Smartphones), bilingual glossaries with visuals and 
activities by subject area (such as ones provided on the DOE website) are also used by the students. Content area input is 
made comprehensible in a variety of ways, and students are allowed flexibility in producing a response to the material, thus 
demonstrating the students' comprehension of the lesson. Mini-assessments and observations are done on a regular basis in 
order to help monitor progress and understanding of the content area in ENL students.  Reading and writing checklists are 
used and next steps are also given to students on a regular basis. At times for the Entering and/or Emerging students, we 
provide prompts, sentence starters, feedback and checklists in the students’ native language when applicable. 
A DESCRIPTION OF HOME LANGUAGE SUPPORT FOR CONTENT AREA IN THE ENL PROGRAM: Bilingual picture dictionaries, as 
well as bilingual glossaries are offered to students for science, social studies and Math to help newcomers with vocabulary 
comprehension. ENL teachers and classroom teachers also incorporate flexible grouping which provides ENL students the 
opportunity to work with all peers. Students can be paired up with another student who speaks their home language. The 
language of instruction is English,  however, home language may be used occasionally if possible to explain certain things and 
directions to support the students through the use of Smartphones with the Google translate App in each ENL class. 
The content areas are delivered and made comprehensible in the program model through the use of technology (Smart 
Boards, Laptops, Smartphones with translations), charts, pictures, diagrams, “hands-on manipulatives”, posters, real objects, 
flash cards, vocabulary, hands-on projects, and technology. Students are given hands-on experience in all content areas to help 
foster understanding. Teachers have been offered training and workshops at school on a regular basis. We also have 
purchased Reading, Writing, programs that are aligned with the Common Core. Assessments are all aligned with the NYS Next 
Generation Learning Standards. All ENL teachers have been provided with the Common Core Standards for reference and 
assistance in knowing what is expected of our ENL students.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Upon initial identification through the Home Language Surveys and NYSITELL results, Spanish speakers are given the Spanish 
LAB as per mandates. All speakers of other languages are provided with the opportunity to have translated NYS tests when 
available, and bilingual glossaries and well as home language support through technology (Smartphones, laptops, tablets) for 
Content Areas (Science, Math) when available.  We utilize the assistance of the Translation Unit for home communication 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

when necessary.    
Students in the TBE program will be evaluated through written and oral assessments in Mandarin and English language. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. Describe your plan for SIFE students: 
In this school year, there were no students identified as SIFE. However, we have developed a plan for SIFE students should any 
arrive. We would follow and refer to the “SIFE Resources” on the Intranet on the “Instructional and Compliance” page. There is 
an informational SIFE video for reference. Leveled libraries in the classrooms range from two levels below to one level above 
the SIFE student’s identified reading level. SIFE students would receive language appropriate testing in order to screen for 
learning disabilities. We would invite parents to the school in order to learn about their cultural and family backgrounds. 
Students would be provided with differentiated instruction, which would include grouping by ability and need in order to focus 
on developing specific targeted skills to maximize gains. 
Also, the following: 
●             Assign the students a partner to help get them get accustomed to the daily schedule and school environment. 
●             Activate prior knowledge; see where a good starting point for the students can be. Try to make connections to what 
they already know so teachers can create a starting point and the students will feel motivated and not frustrated. 
●             Use visuals, have students be “hands on” whenever possible, have them create their own glossaries, use 
manipulatives, have them do interactive technology assignments at the SMART board or on the laptops. When teaching new 
vocabulary, rephrasing, define within the context of the word, pause and use intonations when necessary. 
 
b. Describe your plan for ELLs in US schools less than three years (newcomers): 
 In order to meet the needs of newcomers, I.S. 237Q has taken a series of actions.  
 ENL students who are considered to be newcomers get differentiated instruction with an emphasis on methodologies and 
content-based vocabulary to increase BICS and CALP vocabulary usage, spelling, grammar, questioning and critical thinking 
skills.  They also have access to ENL-based technology.  This includes a wide range of online websites such as Duolingo, Starfall, 
English4Everyone, Achieve3000, BrainPop and Youtube.  These students are grouped together to allow for more attention 
from the teachers.  
Both the classroom teacher and ENL teacher work collaboratively to incorporate as much language as possible into the 
classroom environment. Vocabulary, word walls, and charts are used within lessons. Technology is infused within lessons in 
order to assist students even further. Students work in small groups, especially during reading and writing to ensure their 
areas of need are met. ENL teachers provide extra assistance using graphic organizers and specialized differentiated 
worksheets to target specific skills. There is test prep given using Ready NYS practice books to model and scaffold testing 
strategies. There is also a technology component to these practice books as well.  All ENL students have an opportunity to 
attend an after-school program for ELA and math prior to the standardized testing. In the three months prior to state testing, 
all students are offered to attend a Saturday Test Prep Academy which are given by our teachers. These classes use Getting 
Ready for the NYSESLAT by Attanasio & Associates, Inc. and Finish Line New York ENLs Bilingual Common Core by Continental 
which helps the ENL students greatly. At times, the ENL teachers may also work with small groups within the classroom in 
order to teach or model a language skill of particular difficulty. 
I.S. 237 Guidance Counselor is available to assist students having difficulty adjusting to the New York City educational system 
and the demands of participating in their new educational environment and culture.  
Parents are an essential ingredient in the success of all students, especially those who are new to an English language school 
system.  In order to assist the parents with helping their children succeed, I.S. 237 employs a full-time Parent Coordinator, 
Shirley Bryant. Our parent coordinator holds parent orientation meetings and various workshops throughout the year where 
they may learn about their rights as parents: such as “Know Your Rights of Immigrant Parents”, the NYS Curriculum, State 
assessments, and how to help their children at home. These workshops provide parents and guardians with the opportunity to 
attend a variety of family literacy and math workshops, so they can better assist in the education of their children at home. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

Parents will also become familiar with the new NYS Next Generation Learning Standards and the NYSESLAT.  They will also 
become familiar with the ELA Performance Standards.  Our staff will continue work to involve parents further in their 
children’s academic success.  All teachers continue to work to improve communication with the families of our ENL students. 
I.S.237 uses the Translation Unit to correspond with parents. 
As previously stated, within the classroom, teachers will be employing many different ENL methodologies with all ENL students 
on various levels.  For newly arrived students, teachers can pair the student with a partner who speaks the student’s first 
language in order to provide assistance as needed.  Teachers also provide any native language support available through books 
or technology. Newcomer groups may be formed to provide basic vocabulary, cultural and communication skills.  Since the 
educational environment and individual situation for each student is different it is helpful to gather as much information as 
possible about the educational level of new students through formal and informal assessments to determine the educational 
level and to see if any new student could also be SIFE. 
Picture dictionaries, bilingual picture dictionaries, content-area bilingual glossaries, along with picture collections/cards 
provide basic vocabulary development for our newcomers.  I.S. 237 has computers available to all classrooms and a variety of 
interactive language development programs available for different levels of English language proficiency, including the 
Achieve3000 program which is used every day. Many new books and supplies have been purchased for our classrooms. 
c. Describe your plan for ENLs receiving 4-6 years service and your plan for developing ENLs: 
I.S. 237 provides all ENLs with more than four years interventions when available. Our school continues to use a variety of 
instructional strategies to make concepts more comprehensible to students.  We enhance language development using 
various ENL strategies such as pre-teaching to scaffold prior knowledge of a specific content area, modeling, the use of 
manipulative, differentiated graphic organizers, multi-leveled books on the computer, guided reading books in a variety of 
levels, vocabulary building, and reading comprehension. Small group remediation may also be used within the classroom 
during the school day. Instruction is geared toward strategies that build skills, such as persuasive or argument writing, 
annotating texts, citing text evidence, inferring, main idea, and cause and effect, etc. The program provides level set activities 
aligned with the individual needs of each student. These lessons help students become more proficient in math and better 
readers.  Lessons are based on the NYS Learning Standards. ENL students are invited to participate in all academic 
interventions available in our school, such as AIS, small group instruction, after-school programs, and homework help.  Our 
school continues to use a variety of instructional strategies to make concepts more comprehensible to students. ENL students 
are invited to participate in any academic interventions available in our school, in any subject area of need. 
 
d. Describe your plan for ENLs receiving 4-6 years service and your plan for Long-term ENLs: 
 
As stated above, I.S. 237 provides all ENLs with more than four years interventions when available. Our school continues to use 
a variety of instructional strategies to make concepts more comprehensible to students.  We enhance language development 
using various ENL strategies such as pre-teaching to scaffold prior knowledge of a specific content area, modeling, the use of 
manipulative, differentiated graphic organizers, multi-leveled books on the computer, guided reading books in a variety of 
levels, vocabulary building, and reading comprehension. Small group remediation may also be used within the classroom 
during the school day. Instruction is geared toward strategies that build skills, such as persuasive or argument writing, 
annotating texts, citing text evidence, inferring, main idea, and cause and effect, etc. The program provides level set activities 
aligned with the individual needs of each student. These lessons help students become more proficient in math and better 
readers.  Lessons are based on the NYS Learning Standards. ENL students are invited to participate in all academic 
interventions available in our school, such as AIS, small group instruction, after-school programs, and homework help.  Our 
school continues to use a variety of instructional strategies to make concepts more comprehensible to students. ENL students 
are invited to participate in any academic interventions available in our school, in any subject area of need. 
 
e. Describe your plan for former ENLs: 
 Commanding students are serviced by ENL teachers for 90 minutes a week as per the recently revised CR-Part 154.2.  They 
have direct instruction activities to support language development. They are offered the opportunity to participate in the Title 
III Program for ENLs. They are invited to partake in any of the activities offered to ENLs. All former ENLs who achieved a level 
of proficiency within the last two years receive the same testing modifications as ENLs. We ensure that all former ENLs receive 
all ELL testing accommodations for two years after they exit the program. Former ENLs participate in the ENL programs. These 
students remain in the ENL supported classes for up to two years. NYSESLAT scores are shared with the classroom teachers in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

order to enable them to tailor instruction to the needs of former ENL students.  Staff development and ENL instructional 
strategies are shared with all teachers on each grade level, not just teachers with ENL students.  This approach ensures that all 
teachers who have former ENL students in their classes are versed in the approaches which are successful with students from 
other than English language backgrounds. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL students with disabilities whose IEP recommends ENL, or a language para, are provided with the appropriate instructional 
strategies and setting as per the IEP recommendations and goals. These students are part of small-group instruction on a daily 
basis which helps them to focus more easily. Because of their learning disabilities, these students require a small group. This 
small group setting allows these students more “talk-time” and “question-time.” This also allows the teachers to assess if the 
students are completing their “next steps” on a regular basis. Leveled classroom libraries, varied computer programs such as 
Achieve3000, Brain Pop, and Starfall, which focus on all four modalities: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. 
 Students are also provided with all grade-level books for all content based subjects (Science, Social Studies, and Math). Many 
language-based activities are done within the school and within the classroom. All these activities, plus the differentiated 
instruction help to accelerate English language development. 
SWD ELLs receive all services are per mandates:    
•   Entering level SWD students receive 180 minutes standalone ENL plus 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA for a total of 360 
minutes.  
•   Emerging SWD students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes standalone or 
integrated ENL or any other content area. 
•   Transitioning SWD students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction plus 90 minutes standalone or integrated 
ENL or any other content area. 
•   Expanding SWD Students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction. 
•   Commanding SWD students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/other content area instruction. 
   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
I.S. 237Q has ENL students with special needs in self-contained 12:1:1 classes and in I.C.T/SETSS (Integrated Co-teaching) 
settings.  We attempt to make students succeed and feel welcome as well as ensure that all instruction is culturally relevant 
and connected to the students lives in some way. Flexible programming at our school ensures that ELL-SWDs experience 
maximum time spent with peers. All students participate in school- wide events together and common grades attend class 
trips together.  All students heterogeneously participate in extra-curricular activities and perform in shows together, such as 
School Musical Performances, ceremonies, contests, as well as any other school-wide events. 
●             ELL-SWDs receive the same mandated minutes of ENL services as students in the general education environment as 
follows: 
•   Entering level students receive 180 minutes standalone ENL plus 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA for a total of 360 
minutes.  
•   Emerging students receive 90 minutes standalone ENL, 180 minutes integrated ENL/ELA and 90 minutes standalone or 
integrated ENL or any other content area. 
•   Transitioning students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA instruction plus 90 minutes standalone or integrated ENL 
or any other content area. 
•   Expanding Students receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or other content area instruction. 
•   Commanding students receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA or ENL/other content area instruction. 
 Currently, ELL students with special needs are serviced through a pull-out model.  Programs are created in order to ensure 
time (and group size) mandates are met.  In this case, the group size would not exceed 12 students in order to fulfill the 
mandates of the student’s IEP.  Instruction is developed pertaining to the matters of grouping, teaching methodology, testing 
accommodations and assessment, through the information provided on the student’s IEP. 
As said previously, flexible programming at our school ensures that ELL-SWDs experience maximum time spent with peers. All 
students participate in school-wide events together, common grades attend class trips together, and school-wide initiatives to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

ensure all students' equal participation. All students heterogeneously participate in extra-curricular activities and perform in 
shows together, such as winter and spring School Performances.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
I.S 237’s targeted intervention programs for ENLs in ELA, Math and other Core Content areas are as follows: Students in need 
are given Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in an after-school program, Magic Box, Achieve 3000, Saturday Academy, 
collaborative team teaching, arts-oriented programs (Roundabout) and Queens Child Guidance (OST). 
They are given additional supportive instruction in small groups targeting their areas of need.  This is done during their 
regularly scheduled classes. In addition, ENL teachers push-in to content area classes to provide strategies and scaffolds for 
ENL students. For example, some teachers provide vocabulary support, differentiated reading, work centers and station 
activities.We also use Achieve 3000, Brain Pop, duo lingo and Google Classroom.  
These interventions are made available to all students in our school.  This includes ENL students and students with IEP reports.  
For our ENL population, we have bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, some bilingual libraries, and the support of the 
Translation Unit. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Some of the programs that may be considered for the upcoming school year (depending on Title III budget) are: an After-
School program to target emerging and transitioning ENLs who have difficulty obtaining proficiency on the Reading or Writing 
portion of the NYSESLAT and those who made minimal gains on the ELA We will do this by analyzing all four modalities of the 
NYSESLAT, as well as the scores of the State ELA, math, and science exam.  In addition, we are planning to open a Mandarin 
bilingual program in the sixth grade.  This decision was based on parent responses on the HLIS forms.  Lastly, we will also 
consider adding more hours to our morning program for newcomers to enrich their foundational English skills. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ENL students are afforded equal access to all school programs. ENL students are invited to participate in any and all 
previously mentioned after-school programs offered. Invitations and permission slips to all school events and programs are 
sent home with students. The forms are sent home in a variety of languages if available. Our Parent Coordinator often helps 
with the distribution and connection to parents. She is also available to all parents for questions and answers. Every class also 
has the opportunity to participate in every school activity and special event equally. Some of these activities include carnivals, 
movies, trips to Philadelphia, Washington, museums, special assemblies sporting events to name a few.  Our ENLs, and ALL our 
students are a regular part of the school and all students are 100% equally invited and included in everything. 
 Students on all grade levels are provided with computer-based instructional programs (Achieve 3000, Brain Pop, duo-lingo, IXL 
and Google classrooms). These computer-based programs are offered in both the computer lab and in the regularly scheduled 
classes.  Headphones are provided for each student so they may use the program properly and without distraction.  These 
programs establish each student’s strengths and weaknesses and provide individualized instruction accordingly.  Students in 
need are given Academic Intervention Services (AIS) in an after-school program, a before school program, Magic Box, Saturday 
Academy, collaborative team teaching, arts-oriented programs (Roundabout) and Queens Child Guidance (OST).  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ENL and Bilingual students at I.S. 237Q participate in interactive computer-based instructional programs using both the 
Smart Boards in their classrooms, as well as brand-new laptop computers. They can access Brain Pop, Achieve3000, IXL, Google 
Classroom, as well as research information and view informational videos on the Internet. Some of these programs perform 
diagnostic assessments and design individualized instruction to meet the needs of each student.  Student progress is tracked 
and the program adjusts instruction according to student strengths and weaknesses. 
IS 237Q has purchased the iReady content based computer program which will be rolled out during the 2017-2018 school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

 

I.S. 237Q has also purchased Ready New York Common Core Learning Standards series of test prep books. These books provide 
specific instruction, by grade-level, designed to prepare students for the ELA and math exams. These books include lessons for 
listening, reading and writing. By previewing with students, the structure, and type of questions on the ELA state exam, we will 
ensure that students are well prepared for the test.  Each of the lessons contains an ENL component and an ENL focus point 
based on the learning standards. ENL teachers and classroom teachers can use these activities for instruction targeting 
ENLs and Bilingual students. 
For students who need help in writing, we provide instruction by following the Writer’s Workshop model using the Next 
Generation Learning Standards, and technology such as the Smart Board, desktops or laptops, whenever possible. ENL 
students have the visuals of the Smart Board to help them understand topics and concepts further. Small group instruction is 
sometimes used with the Smart Board or laptop computers which allow the students more opportunity to interact in the 
writing process and to be a part of more modeled writing. It also provides focus and interest to struggling students. These 
students may also receive extra instructional minutes whenever possible, as previously stated. During these minutes, the 
students have the opportunity for extra writing conferences to target areas that those students continue to struggle. Students 
are also given individual "Next Steps" to help guide them with what they need to work on.  Informal assessments include 
running records, portfolios, teacher observation, and teacher/student conferencing.  Formal assessments include NYSITELL, 
NYSESLAT, Achieve3000 and other Standardized tests such as Math, ELA and Science. 
 In reading, ENL’s participate in the Reader’s Workshop Model using technology such as the Smart Board whenever 
possible.  Students are involved in modeled reading and interactive reading while using the Smart Board in conjunction with 
the teacher. ENL and Bilingual students have the visuals of the Smart Board to help them understand topics and concepts 
further. Group instruction is used with the Smart Board which allows the students more opportunity to interact in the reading 
process. It also provides focus and interest to struggling students. The students are engaged in shared reading, guided reading, 
independent reading, accountable talk as well as developing language experiences.  Instruction is geared toward skills and 
strategies which will build literacy, such as inferring, the main idea, and cause and effect.  We enhance reading development 
using various ENL strategies such as scaffolding, vocabulary building, and reading comprehension. Small group remediation 
may also be used.  
I.S. 237 uses the NYS Next Generation Learning Standards and Reader’s and Writer’s workshop model using genuine literature. 
Teacher-generated materials such as charts and graphs provide a print-rich classroom environment.  Leveled classroom 
libraries help all students. The mini-lesson focus points provide feedback, introduce elements and address student needs.  In 
writer’s workshop, students use journals, sourcebooks, note taking charts and post-it notes for note-taking and generating 
researched based reports. Students produce writing pieces and edit their stories through the writing process.   
Beginning in mid-October 2017, ENL and Bilingual students will have the opportunity to participate in an after-school program 
focusing on modalities that support students in learning English.  Additionally, there will be a Saturday ENL/Bilingual Academy 
for students to attend.  This program will focus on preparing students for the NYSESLAT exam. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is provided through the ENL program model through the use classroom bilingual library books, 
bilingual dictionaries/glossaries and websites offered through our computers, such as Duo-lingo. Students are also able to use 
the bilingual support service (Google Translate) on any computer program available, which gives directions and vocabulary to 
the students in both English and in their home language (as much as possible).  Translated tests and oral translators are 
offered to students for the New York State content area exams. New students are also paired up with a partner that speaks 
their home language to give them social support, which in turn makes them more comfortable academically. Also, teachers 
were supplied with iPads that contain translation apps for usage within the classroom with ENLs. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services support, and all resources correspond to ENLs’ ages and grade levels appropriately. All Achieve3000 
computer assessments (and activities) are set up by grade level. All books purchased and provided are appropriate for all 
students' grade levels. When a student participates in any program, all activities are grade-level appropriate. All library books 
used in the classroom for all subject areas are grade appropriate for all ENL students.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 

 

I.S. 237 shares a building with East West School of International Studies (25Q281).  Mainly, two separate resources are used for 
each school.  We do have shared spaces, such as library in which books that meet the needs of ENLs are shared. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
When new ENL students enroll prior to the start of the school year, the Guidance Counselor, AP and Parent Coordinator assist 
new ENLs who enroll. This assistance includes an orientation to show the students around the school as well as placing 
students with a partner to help them acclimate to the new school environment. Students who speak little or no English are 
paired with those who are able to speak their language.  We continue to provide all students with strong visuals for more 
support and understanding. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  
Some ELLs are offered Spanish as an elective. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In this school year, I.S. 237 will hold professional staff development workshops for teachers with ELL students in their 
classes.  Workshop topics specifically for the ENL teachers may include: Strategies to Use in Your Classroom, Co-Teaching in the 
Content Area and Station Learning.  ENL teachers participate in a wide variety of staff development offered at our school.  All 
teachers, including ENL teachers, will participate in other workshops such as: technology workshops (including Smart Board, 
Google Classrooms, PBIS, and child abuse. Personnel involved in receiving professional development are: general education 
classroom teachers, special education classroom teachers, content area teachers, ENL teachers, assistant principals, 
paraprofessionals, guidance counselors, psychologists, speech therapists, and our  Parent Coordinator, just to name a few. 
There are workshops offered for all staff in different content areas. For example, Strategies to Help At-Risk Students, Strategies 
in Math and ELA, as well as Science and Social Studies Workshops as needed. There is staff development for all teachers on 
Election Day, Brooklyn Queens Day, after school, during the day - common preps, as well as outside workshops offered 
through the DOE and the UFT.  This year we plan to implement professional development for all teachers to address more ENL 
strategies and methodologies.  We will also focus on more technology-based workshops. We will work with all our specialists, 
as well as our administration to provide additional support for all members of our staff. 
As stated by the CR Part 80, a minimum of 15% of professional hours will be dedicated to language acquisition, co-teaching and 
integrated language in the content areas for ENLs. Bilingual and new language teachers will have a minimum of 50% of 
professional hours focused on language acquisition, best-practices, and co-teaching strategies. 
The dates and sources of this professional development is yet to be determined by the administration. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
In this school year, I.S. 237 will hold professional staff development workshops geared toward teachers with ENL students in 
their classes.  Workshop topics specifically geared toward the ENL program may include: Strategies to Use in Your Classroom, 
Co-Teaching in the Content Area and Station Learning.  ENL teachers participate in a wide variety of staff development offered 
at our school.  All teachers, including ENL teachers, will participate in other workshops such as: technology workshops

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL department in collaboration with the Parent Coordinator, and Language Proficiency Team (LPT) will work together to 
provide provisions for interpretations and translations, both oral and written, of all pertinent information. 
Individual meetings will be held to discuss the goals and progress of ENL students.  ENL teachers will utilize Tuesday afternoons 
and Team Teacher Meetings to contact parents.    The meetings will include the student's ENL teacher and their content 
teachers.  The team of teacher's will keep records of these meetings in individual logs. They will include date, time, and 
information discussed.  Translators will be used as necessary.  These include teachers who are fluent in the students’ home 
languages, guidance counselors, paraprofessionals, and operators from the translation and interpretation unit via phone.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parent involvement at I.S.237 is ongoing. Parents are included and invited to many activities, workshops, and meetings held 
here at I.S. 237.  This, of course, includes the parents of ENLs. 
 Parents are given an opportunity to "Meet and Greet" the teachers at a parent orientation for all grade levels at the start of 
the school year. This includes meeting with all service providers and content teachers who explain their programs and share 
information with all parents. We also have “Breakfast with the Principal”. Our Parent Coordinator makes sure that all parents 
receive information about everything happening here at I.S. 237. Information is also offered and delivered in Spanish and 
Chinese by the guidance counselors which greatly benefits the parents of ENLs. Parents are also invited to attend our monthly 
PTA meetings, where they are given every opportunity to voice their concerns and questions. All meetings have translation 
services available to the parents. 
 
Here at I.S. 237 we make every attempt to send parents information via translated letters, flyers, calendars, and school 
newsletters to keep them involved in the I.S. 237 school family. We also support and involve our parents during parent-teacher 
conferences by offering translators and translation services offered by the DOE, as well as using Google Translate and Smart 
Phones for translations. 
The administration, staff and parent coordinator at I.S. 237Q evaluate the needs of parents through many channels. Parents 
participate in filling out the NYC Parent Surveys. We also address concerns at PTA meetings and SLT meetings. We provide 
translation services at these meetings if needed. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

 

Our Parent Coordinator, Shirley Bryant, ensures that all parents are included and involved in all school activities and that all 
parents receive information and notifications in a wide variety of languages. She is also available for meetings to support and 
evaluate the needs of all parents, including the parents of ENLs, as well as maintains a parent information board where flyers 
and information is posted and updated for all parents. Our Parent Coordinator also assists with collecting and analyzing the 
Parent Surveys, which also helps greatly in evaluating the needs of parents. 
The workshops, orientations, after-school center and Parent/Teacher Conferences provided or arranged for by the Parent 
Coordinator at I.S. 237Q are directly aligned with the parents needs as per their requests both verbally and through data from 
the surveys. The parental involvement activities address the needs of the parents in many ways. First, by involving parents in 
all school activities make it possible for our parents to see the success and growth of their children on a regular basis. Parents 
can proudly recognize the achievements of their child/children. Parents stay in touch with the daily lives of their children, thus 
fostering a stronger communication bond both socially and academically. Several parents are also members of the PTA.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Judith Friedman, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

I.S. 237 uses a variety of ATS reports, such as the School Level Adult Preferred Language Report (RAPL) and the 
and the School Level Emergency Contact Student List (RCON) as well as the Home Language Identification Survey 
(HLIS) to identify and access the language preferences of the parents in our school community. Using this data, we 
have identified Cantonese Chinese, Mandarin Chinese, Fucanese Chinese, Spanish, Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, 
Gujarati, and Urdu as the main language groups in I.S. 237. In additon to collecting data reports from ATS, blue 
emergency cards, and HLIS, we also conduct individual interiews with ELL eligible students that first enter our 
school building to identify and assess language preferences of the parents in our school community.  

Once this data is collected, a list is created and shared with school staff and faculty as a reference so that all 
forms, documents, newsletters, report cards, progress reports, school and testing calendars, and letters are sent 
home in English and parents' preferred language to increase parent engagement. In addition, I.S. 237 utilized the

I.S. 237 makes every effort to communicate with parents in their preferred language, using in-house translators, 
and the NYC Department of Education Translation and Interpretation Unit. Throughout the schooI year, our ELL 
cordinator regulary generates and reviews up-to-date ATS reports which indicate preferred languages for parents 
in our school community.  

I.S. 237 uses the methodologies described above to try and communicate with parents in every way possible. We 
are always working on ways to improve communications with all of our parents in our school community.
