Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality

Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify 

the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content 
standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 
 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

The school was founded on the principles espoused by Antonia Pantoja, the person for whom the school was named. 
The school’s mission focuses on empowering students with a purposeful education and appropriate skills that allow 
APPA graduates to successfully navigate a society that is increasingly diverse, technological, and multicultural. In order 
to prepare students for such a reality, the academic priorities are supported with integrated service learning. Through 
the school’s curriculum and service learning experiences, the goal is to foster students who value citizenship, 
scholarship, and integrity, the core values of the school. 

 
2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including 

a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented. 

School Context 

Antonia Pantoja Preparatory Academy (APPA) is located in the Soundview section of the Bronx and is co-located on 
the Adlai Stevenson Campus. APPA serves approximately 440 students in grades 6-12, with about 210 students on 
register for middle school and about 230 students on register for high school. APPA is currently in its 8th year and will 
graduate its sixth middle school cohort and its second high school cohort at the end of this school year.  

The demographic information for our current students is as follows:  

● 49% males and 51% females 

● 5.8% Asian or Pacific Islander 

● 68% Hispanic 

● 24% Black 

● 1% American Indian or Alaskan Native 

● .2% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander 

● 1% White 

● 27% Special Education  

● 13.5% English Language Learners 

 

The 6-12 model affords the school more time to nurture students to meet the expectations of the school mission. The 
school has been working on creating a cohesive 7-year plan through innovative programming, strong partnerships, 
and creative service learning opportunities.  

APPA’s innovative programming decisions center around the following:  

 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          11

APPA also continues to foster strong partnerships to address the social-emotional needs of our students.  

● The Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) has been the school’s main Community Based  

Organization (CBO) since 2010. The organization serves approximately 100 students and provides them 

with homework help and extracurricular activities. The YMCA also runs the Y Scholars program where YMCA 
employees assist teachers in their classes throughout the regular school day.  

● New York University School of Social Work Step Up Program provides individual and group counseling to support 
students’ academic and/ or social emotional needs. 

● Good Shepherd Services Ernst and Young Mentoring Program matches students with mentors from the company to 
develop positive one-on-one, career focused relationships with students.

Our population includes students that need support with cognitive processing, and emotional growth and 
development. Their learning needs are below the standard level of expectation in core subject areas and instruction is 
modified and designed specifically to meet their learning needs and styles. Some students require intervention of 
special education teachers through direct SETSS either push-in or pull-out in groups of no more than eight. Special 
Education teachers are able to provide this small group support by identifying the needs of the students in 
collaboration with the core content teachers and provide academic intervention to build student skill levels. In the the 
integrated co teaching environment students are provided with core content teachers and special education teachers 
who provides academic intervention and support based on the dictates of their IEPs. 

Some students are provided with 12:1 instruction in a self contained environment.  

 

Students for whom English is a new language are tested to determine their level of proficiency in the English 
language. Based on that data students are provided with language services and supports that will make the proficient 
and commanding in reading and writing. Depending on their level they are provided a varying amount of instructional 
minutes per week for both pull out and push in services.  

 

The population is comprised of 27% Special Education and 13.5% English Language Learners. 

 
4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the 

past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As we refer to the elements of Framework for Great Schools, the school has made the most progress in: 

 

Supportive Environment 

Based on the feedback from the 2016-2017 School Quality Review, one of the areas where the school demonstrated 
growth was in School Culture ( QR indicator 1.4 and 3.4 ). We are in our third cycle of Restorative Justice 
implementation. We work in partnership with The Leadership Program. They provide our campus with a 
representative who works in tandem with our activities coordinator to provide staff professional develop and assists 
with the facilitation of our new Peace Ambassadors Institute to train students to be peer mediators. The 
implementation of RJ has helped support us in our efforts to build community and to move from being a punitive, 
reactive community to a more restorative, proactive community. In addition, our school has incorporated a new 
ladder of referral by adopting an A.P.P.A (Aware of our Emotions, Productive in our Efforts, Peacemakers of our 
School, Accountable for our Actions) Pledge that outlines the steps to provide our students with restorative approach 
to addressing inappropriate behaviors and serves as a guide to incorporate relationship building between staff and 
students.  

 

In addition, we have thematic monthly Town Halls to promote community building, celebrate student success, and 
recognize other elements. 

 

Strong Family-Community Ties 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          15 

 

The progress has is also attributed to the strong partnerships within the school such as YMCA. This is a longstanding 
partnership that provides both the academic and social-emotional supports that students need The YMCA does not 
only provide support after school, but the addition of the Y Scholar Program allows the Y staff to truly be part of the 
APPA community as they assist teachers and students during the school day within classes.  

 

 

Effective Leadership 

Based on the feedback from the 2016-2017 School Quality Review, one of the areas where the school demonstrated 
growth was in Systems for Improvement indicator (QR Indicator 1.3 and 3.1). The Principal has made strategic 
organizational decisions to support the school’s instructional goals and meet student learning needs, as evidenced by 
the comprehensive Academic Intervention program and the Extended Regents Prep program. In addition, she has 
established a coherent vision of school improvement that is reflected in a short list of focused, data-based goals that 
are tracked for progress and are understood and supported by the entire school community. The list includes 
providing a year long professional development calendar that includes cycles of Teacher Team Inquiry, Emotional 
Intelligence foundations, and Mastery Connect Data collection and analysis Workshops.  

 

The key areas of that we will focus on are: 

 

Collaborative Teachers and Rigorous Instruction 

Based on the feedback from the 2016-2017 School Quality Review, one of the areas where the school demonstrated a 
need for development was in Instructional Core ( QR Indicators 1.1, 1.2, and 2.2). The faculty and staff continually 
work to build their capacity to work in teacher teams, to teach in 90 minute blocks for ELA, Math, and Science classes, 
and to provide multiple entry points for all students. However, the transition has been inconsistent among different 
departments. Therefore, we are working to develop teacher pedagogy that incorporates a school-wide coherent set 
of beliefs about how students learn best that is informed by the instructional shifts, Danielson's Framework for 
Teaching, and meets the needs of all learners. We are leveraging Monday Professional Development time and our 
Tuesday Other Professional work to collaboratively, refine, and revise curriculum so that unit and lesson plans 
culminate in rigorous performance tasks. 

 

In addition, teacher programs have been created to allow for subject teachers and support teachers (Special 
Education and ENL teachers) to consistently meet for common planning to create unit and lesson plans, to collect and 
analyze data, and determine next steps for instructional modification. Our instructional focus for this year is  

Goal 1: Use data and cycles of inquiry to create multiple entry points to meet all student needs, including ENLs and 
SWDs. 
Goal 2: Use success criteria aligned to the components of ELA State standards to annotate, and cite text based 
evidence to encourage a passion for writing. 
Goal 3: Implement backwards design to provide immediate and purposeful feedback, aligned to student goals.  

 

5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the 

instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards; 
provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Tenet 3: Rigorous Instruction  

1) Based on the feedback from the 2016-2017 School Quality Review, one of the areas where the school demonstrated a 
need for development was in Instructional Core. Teachers need support in building their capacity in aligning curriculum 
to the CCLS, creating engaging curriculum that meets the needs of all learners (i.e., SWDs and ELLs). Therefore, we need 
to continue our work in developing teacher teams that are able to refine and revise curriculum so that unit and lesson 
plans culminate in rigorous performance tasks, whose rubrics enable students to see how their work meets the 
demands of the common core learning standards(CCLS). 

2) The school needs to leverage the Monday professional development plan to focus on providing teachers with support 
around designing coherent instruction aligned to CCLS and the school’s instructional focus. Teachers will continue to 
engage in working within their department and grade teams to look at lesson plans and student work, specifically 
looking to see evidence of higher order thinking as defined by Depth of Knowledge and Hess’s Cognitive Matrix.  

3) Teachers need to meet in Professional Learning Communities(PLC) (both vertical and horizontal) and focus on aligning 
CCLS across grades 6-12. To support all learners, special education and ELL teachers will continue to provide 
differentiation strategies during these meetings as teachers discuss units of study and lesson plans.

4) The school needs to have systems and structures around assessment, such as a school wide assessment calendar. 
Teachers will need to administer and analyze pre-assessments and post-assessments that align to rigorous performance 
tasks.  

5) Teachers need to create opportunities (such as the use of portfolio's) for students to reflect on their work and keep 
track of their learning to promote a sense of ownership.  

6) Provide series of workshops to parents on the Core subject to support their understanding of the common core 
standards and the instructional shifts enabling them to support their children. These workshops will be held on Tuesdays 
during parent involvement time and hosted by subject teachers.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, our teacher teams will continue to work together to increase the rigor, coherence, and vertical alignment 
in ELA and Math, through the use of data driven inquiry cycles to track student mastery of CCLS and the instructional 
shifts which will result in a 5% increase of students on the State Assessments by June 2019 as tracked through Skedula.

back to PLCs to further review lesson plans and tasks. 

Teachers 

Programming decisions provide students and teachers with support 
around Common Core shifts. For examples, 90-minute classes in ELA 
and math provide students with more time on task to meet the 
Common Core instructional shifts. Additionally, the co-teaching 
model inclusive of ICT classes as well as 2 general education 
teachers in classes whenever possible, allows teachers to work 
collaboratively and share their knowledge.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 

1) The Alternate QR indicates that the school needs to continue to find innovative ways to engender buy-in amongst 
students, through programs such as PBIS, so that all members of the school community are a part of a deliberate system 
that reinforces positive academic and personal behaviors for all students.  

2) The school needs to strengthen partnerships with programs such as the YMCA and Step Up to provide socio-
emotional supports. Additionally, the school needs to develop a Case Management Team where a group of individuals 
discuss students who are at risk and implement a plan of action to support them.  

3) The school needs to assess the School Learning Environment Survey as well as perform a mid-year assessment around 
the environment and culture and use that data to address the social and emotional needs of students. This is a practice 
that has not been consistent at the school.  

4) Implement restorative justice discipline.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          25 

 

The school also needs to find innovative ways to bridge the MS and HS so that there is cohesion within the 6-12 model. 
Part of this work involves creating opportunities for strategic and purposeful interactions and activities between 
students in the MS and HS, such as school wide assemblies and mentoring programs.  

The school will implement an integrated youth development approach to address the welfare of the whole child.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools –Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, our school will embed Restorative Practices within a PBIS Framework to support student success which 
will result in a 5% decrease in suspension and incidents, as identified by the school’s data as measured by the OORS data 
and Skedula anecdotals.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-need 
student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

In order to address the social emotional needs of our students, we 
have partnered with YMCA to work with our students both during 
the day and after school. During the day, YMCA staff members work 
with teachers in the classrooms to help students remain on task and 
provide a secondary instructional resource. 

Students 

Step Up works closely with our high school students to monitor their 
academic and social progress. Their goal is to “connect young people 
with mental health clinical supports, positive young adult role 
models, supported internships, employment opportunities and non-
stigmatizing family-level interventions. The ultimate goal of STEP-UP 
is to offer intensive programming for young people within their 
natural contexts (home, school and community) in order to organize 
supports geared towards high school graduation, college 
preparedness and eventual employment success.” 

Rather than suspend students for low level infractions, we ask that 
they work within the school community to enrich the environment 
and provide additional support. Tasks include creating bulletin board 
displays in and out of the classroom, answering telephones, 
delivering messages, and preparing for school events. We hope this 
will foster a vested interest from the student while giving staff 
members the opportunity to determine preventive strategies to 
avoid future infractions. 

Students 

School counselors work closely with all students to set academic 
expectations and monitor progress towards reaching those goals, 
teach strategies towards positive behavior modification.

4) According to the Alternate Quality Review, schools needs to continue to refine teacher practice so that teachers 
stimulate student thinking by asking questions through the use of adaptive CCLS instructive materials that contain high 
levels of text and content complexity so that all student can access rigorous and engaging content. 

5) Teachers need strong PD around how to implement the curricula such as iReady, Balance Literacy and Engage NY. 
They need a better understanding of the curriculum so that they know how to implement and refine it for the needs of 
their students.  

6)Teachers need Professional development around how to create, analyze, and use assessment data to inform 
instructional decisions. While the school has implemented a school wide assessment calendar, teachers need support 
around how to use student data to strategically group students, monitor progress, and differentiate instruction.  

7)The school needs a cohesive system of classroom routines around daily formative assessments to monitor student 
progress to inform instructional decisions. 

8) To ensure rigorous lesson across the curriculum, teachers will be engaged in curriculum mapping project.

During one-on-one observation feedback, the alignment of what 
students are learning goes back to the question of how it is aligned 
to the school’s instructional focus and providing differentiation to 
students based on their individual needs. 

Teachers 

The Monday Professional Development will be geared towards the 
alignment of what teachers are doing and what students are 
learning to the school’s instructional focus. 

Teachers 

Teachers will be given the opportunity to observe their colleagues 
using the Danielson framework to gain a better understanding of the 
rubric and supporting evidence for each component.

Inter-visitations will be used to clarify the roles of each teacher in 
the co-teaching model. They will also be used as professional 
learning where teachers better understand the school-wide 
instructional practices and observe the school’s strengths and areas 
for improvement.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1) The school leader has engaged in the process of sharing the state of the school with the School Leadership Team. The 
SLT has discussed the previous year’s SCEP and multiple points of data to develop the goals for 2018-2019 

2) The school leader analyzes multiple points of data such as attendance, scholarship, state assessments, classroom 
observation, and credit accumulation to examine and improve individual and school-wide practices. The school leader 
has also engaged in data analysis during professional development with the school faculty.  

3) The school leader has a clear observation calendar and a system of analyzing teacher progress. One of the areas of 
improvement is to provide teachers with timely written feedback and have systems for holding teachers accountable. 

4) Informed by multiple sets of data, the school leader has made strategic decisions based on the needs of students. The 
school leader has been challenged with the limited amount of time to assess the state of the school and so has had to 
make decisions based on limited knowledge.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
There are several strategies that APPA utilizes to support that staff is highly qualified: 

1) Experienced teachers who received a rating of Effective or Highly Effective mentor 1st and 2nd year teachers. 
Mentoring includes providing feedback on classroom observations and looking at lesson plans and student work 
together.  

2) First year teachers meet with the principal at least 2 times per month and get support around instruction and 
concerns and issues they may have.  

3) All teachers receive professional development on Mondays and 90 minutes and 2 periods per week to engage in 
PLCs and common planning time. PLCs provide teachers with an opportunity to engage in collaborative work with 
colleagues.  

4) All teachers are also provided with opportunities to attend outside the building PD. These PDs include those 
provided by the DOE, the Network, and College Board. 

5) All teachers also receive one-on-one feedback on classroom observations that is timely and actionable 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
School administrators provide professional learning throughout the year for all staff. APPA is currently has hired litlife 
and NTN to provide ongoing professional development in ELA and math to the teachers. In addition to the support for 
teachers, Leadership is also provided support through Generation Ready. Lead teachers will also be provided 
professional development through Office of Teaching and Learning As part of the I3 model, the principal and assistant 
principal receive coaching from a NYCLA coach.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The assessment calendar speaks to the need of pre-assessments and summative assessments. The rationale behind 
this cycle is to determine what students already know and what they still need to know in order to make instructional 
decisions around the planning of the unit and the lessons within the unit. Additionally, the pre-assessment and 
summative assessment allows students and teachers to know the extent to which students mastered the standards 
within the unit and students growth over time. T he coherence of midterms and finals allows teachers to understand 
more holistically the gaps that students across the grades have, which should then inform their decisions around 
curricula revisions.  

The appropriate classroom assessments are determined by teachers. Professional development is provided around 
designing assessments that align with the CCLS to yield the desired learning outcomes. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 08X376 Antonia Pantoja Preparatory Academy: A College Board School, in 
compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for 
creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by 
actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Antonia Pantoja Preparatory Academy will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

APPA’s CBO is the YMCA. Our Community School Director Amber Phillips, has already begun to support integrating 
the work of APPA and YMCA. This summer is spent planning for the 2018/2019 year ahead, implementation of the 
program from inception of school in September and the expectations throughout the year. We will plan all activities,

including college trips, etc. ahead of time to ensure that our activities and events are successful. We plan to meet on 
a regular basis to maintain open communication. Amber is also leading in the support of My Brothers Keeping, our 
attendance initiative. I also have an open-door policy and Amber has made use of this. We touch base on a regular 
basis. She has really become a part of our organization.  

 

We have partnered with Children’s Village through a Hilton grant, to provide 6 to 7 MSW interns, along with a fulltime 
Social worker to support the social and emotional aspects of our work. They will be working with our guidance 
counselors and the after-school program, to ensure our students are supported. This will also build the relationship 
and strengthen our partnership. 

 

YMCA will operate as an extension of our regular day schedule, ensuring students’ needs are met as well as to really 
show that unity. YMCA is an extension of APPA and needs to be such. It allows the students the consistency they need 
to be successful.

o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”

ESL/ELA and Content Learning Standards and the Core Curriculum. Through the primary use of 
the NYSESLAT Preparation Book, the program will promote literacy development and 
refinement; language functions and structures will be taught within the context of the lesson. 
Teachers will model the use of language in ways in which students will be expected to 
participate, and instructional strategies and activities will reflect scientific-based research, used 
as a guide for the development of flexible learning environments that can accommodate 
individual learning different.   
In this program, students will read short stories, analyze picture books, listen to audio and media 
presentations, read documents and retell what they read, write letters and critique each other's 
writing, listen and discuss literature of the various genres, make predictions and inferences, oral 
presentations and evaluate them. The quantitative data to be used is the NYSESLAT, running 
records, state ELA and Regents scores combined with the teacher conferencing notes.

This full-day training will help the ENL providers identify and filter key information to better 
design programs for ELLs and make data-driven decisions that accelerate achievement for the 
ELLs they serve by using the EDAT.  
The information will be turn-key to the ENL Bilingual High School provider by Middle School 
ENL provider. Both ENL Providers in building will then ensure that they plan with ELA  and 
Math content teachers working in the Tittle III programs to use ELL’s data to drive their lesson 
planning to thus accelerate the achievements of ELL’s. 
It will be a one day training Monday, October 31, 2016. At 8:30 am to 2:30pm. 
The title III programs for ELL students’ records will be maintained in the ENL office room 250, 
along with agendas, attendance sheets and any invitations to parents in their preferred language.  
 
PD Activity 3:

Learning A-Z provides a wide array of resources and tools that support English language learners 
(ELLs) and English as a second language (ESL) programs. It provides differentiated materials 
and tools that support the development of English.  ELLs will be supported with tools, resources, 
and research-based strategies that help them achieve success with social and academic English. 
Reading, listening, speaking, and writing resources integrated with grammar and vocabulary 
support are delivered at varying grade and language proficiency levels.  Learning A-Z also 
support educators with resources and tools specifically designed to support ELL and ESL 
instruction. ELL and ESL resources make it easy for teachers to provide reading and listening, 
writing and speaking, grammar, and assessment support for students at all learning levels. 
The information will be turn-key to the ENL Bilingual High School provider by Middle School 
ENL provider. Both ENL Providers in building will then ensure that they plan with ELA content 
teachers working in the Title III programs to use chrome notebooks to guide ENL students in 
logging in to Learning A-Z to work on Reading, Writing, Listening and or speaking 
activities.  Also, teachers will be able to collect ELL’s quantitative data from the use of this 
Learning A-Z which will also accelerate the achievements of ELL’s. 
It will be continues training throughout the school year 2016-2017. First workshop: Wednesday, 
September 28, 2016. At 9:00 am to 3:00pm. There will also be continues training online

provide multiple means for students to show us what they know and can do. We’ll start with 
what participants already have in their schools and then learn new tools. Not only will we 
explore the tools and inquire in our own classrooms about what they can (and cannot) do, we will 
learn an integrated design approach for technological decision-making and develop expertise at 
making thoughtful pedagogical decisions based on what works best for our students’ learning. 
Overall, participants will learn ways to integrate technological tools in sustainable and inclusive 
ways. Teachers in this group will create digital representations of their work to be published in 
the spring. 
The information will be turn-key to the ENL Bilingual High School provider by Middle School 
ENL provider. Both ENL Providers in building will then ensure that they plan with ELA and 
Math content teacher working in the Tittle III programs to copulate ENL’s student work 
successfully completed with the new technological tools to add to digital representation to 
submit as work to be published in the spring.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school uses Leveled Libraries, 100 Book Challenge, and Baseline assessment materials to assess the early literacy skills of 
our ELLs. The data demonstrates that our ELL students need support in developing comprehension in reading and listening 
skills. In addition, instruction needs to focus on developing their vovabulary skills in order to help them develop the strategies 
needed to reinforce their language development. Furthermore, we have found that their greatest deficiency is in writing. Our 
school needs to focus on instruction that is comprehensible to all learners. The instruction should facilitate language learning 
in the content area in particular scaffolding student language development. Moreover, the instruction should provide 
opportunities for ELLs to engage in meaningful, content rich discussions in order to enhance and support their language skills. 
The NYSESLAT total score for grades 6th through 12th demonstrates that fourteen, 14, ELL students achieved profficiency in 
the four modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

Teacher teams, common planning time, reviewing student work, reading program, 100 book challenge,  10 period of ELA, 8 
period of math in the MS.    
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Periodic monitoring by school leaders through formal and informal assessments provides our teachers with insight as to the 
progress and/or setbacks our students are experiencing in the four modalities as well as in the content areas.  In addition, 
teacher observations provide teachers with insights to their instructional practice in terms of what is working and what needs 
to be re-visited.  . 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teacher teams will use mastery connect to guide instruction.  Through looking at student work and assessment data, 
intervention for students will be customized to address their needs.   There is also the MSQI initiative where students are 
testing using the DRP.  This exam is done 3 times for the year and students are placed in small groups for instruction in Just 
Words or Wilson, depending on their levels.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The patterns across profficiency levels and grades on the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT have revealed that our ELLs greatest area of 
need is the writing modality; however, the data in regards to the reading, listening and speaking modalities also demonstrate 
that we need to continue support in these areas as well. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Through teacher teams, data will be addressed and adjustments will be made to instruction to meet the needs of students.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Entering and emerging students participate in a pull-out program.  These studentshave been programmed to meet 
with the ENL 
 teacher the mandated minutes. These groups are ungraded and heterogeneous. 
The transitioning, expanding and commanding students participate in a push-in program where the ENL teacher 
travels to the 
 English/ELA, or History class to provide mandated minutes of service. These groups are upgraded and hetergeneous. 
 The organizational model is the push-in and pull-out model. An ENL teacher works with ELLs during ELA instruction in  
 collaboration with the content teacher to provide English language acquisition and vocabulary support while 
retaining content 
 instructional time.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Entering and emerging students participate in a pull-out program.  These studentshave been programmed to meet with 
the ENL 
 teacher the mandated minutes. These groups are ungraded and heterogeneous.  The transitioning, expanding and 
commanding students participate in a push-in program where the ENL teacher travels to the   English/ELA, or History class to 
provide mandated minutes of service. These groups are upgraded and hetergeneous.  In middle school,  entering and 
emerging ELL students receive a total of 360 minutes per week of ENL instruction, transitioning and expanding ELL students 
receive 180 minutes per week of ENL instruction and comanding ELL students receive 90 minutesper week of ENL instruction. 
In high schoolthe entering and emerging students participate in a  pull out program where the receive 540 minute and 360 
minutes respectively, per week.  Transitioning and expanding receive 180 minutes per week and commanding students receive 
90 minutes for week.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All core content classes are delivered in English.  The content teacher in collaboration with the ENL teacher use Universal 
Design for Learning practices and Depth of Knowledge Leveled Activities to make content comprehensible to foster language 
and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards. Our students receive instruction in English. During the ELA 
and/or  Social Studies/History period our ENL certified teachers use ESL strategies such as scaffolding.  Some examples of 
scaffolding are text representation, bridging, modeling,and making connections to related topics of information. During the 
school year, all content area teachers will be receiving professional development on best practices in ENL. Our teachers follow 
the New York State Common Core Standards in ELA, Social Studies/History and ENL.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   The home language survey is done by the ENL teacher and administrator.  For ELLs of languages other than Spanish the 
central office translation unit is utilized as needed.  In addition, translation of all state exams are utilized in their native 
language with the exeption of the NYS ELA and English Regents.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE students form part of our ENL instructional program and are assessed using a variety of assessment tools such as the 
ELL 
  periodic assessment and Fountas and Pinnell to determine their areas of needs improvement. The NYSESLAT result is also 
utilized to 
 determine  English proficiency level in order to differentiate instruction accordingly. 
 b. Newcomer ELL students who have been in the U.S. less than three years receive support in the native language through 
thematic 
 units of study  in the content areas, classroom libraries and glossaries. The NYSESLAT results is also utilized to determine their 
 English level of  proficiency in order to differentiate instruction. Furthermore, teachers focus on strategies that support 
listening and

 speaking skills during the ENL instruction. Additionally, students are grouped according to their level of proficiency and 
provided 
 small and guided  group instruction. 
 c. Developing ELL students who have been receiving services 4 to 6 years are provided services with a greater emphasis on  
reading and writing  however, their listening and speaking skills are still supported through strategies such as accountable talk 
.  
The reading instruction focuses on the development of the academic language and the writing focuses on developing skills 
analyzing 
 and sythesizing informational text.  
 d. Long term ELLs receive greater support on the development of reading and writing skills. The instructional focus is on 
enhancing  
 academic language and expanding content area vocabulary, particularly in preparing them to be 'college ready'. Long term 
ELLs 
 are also given priority for supplemental programs, such as afterschool or Saturday school. 
 e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status instruction is differentiated using a variety of tools and strategies that 
 supports and provides enrichment for their continued progress in listening, speaking, reading and writing. Small group 
instruction 
 provides them with the opportunity to receive targeted, guided instruction and writing. Former ELLs are also given priority for  
enrichment programs delivered afterschool or on Saturday. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Our ELL-SWD students receive support through thematic units of study in the content areas supported by resources 
throughout the 
 classroom environment such as the library, visual technology, glossaries, dictionaries and graphic organizers. Instruction 
focuses on 
 strategies to develop their reading and writing skills since data demonstrates a lack of progression in these two categories;  
however, listening and speaking continues to be supported through strategies like 'accountable talk'. A variety of data is 
utilized 
 such as the NYSESLAT results to determine their English level of proficiency in order to differentiate instruction. Students are 
 grouped according to their level of proficiency and provided targeted small group instruction. Moreover, the student's 
Individual 
 Educational Plan is reviewed in order to differentiate instruction using a variety of tools and strategies that supports their 
specific needs for development and growth in all modalities: listening, speaking, reading and writing.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The vast majaroty of ELLs are in ICT classes and are mainstreamed with the general education population.  Students currently 
in our 
 12:1 self contained environment are assessed periodically in order to determine if they are ready to be mainstreamed into the 
 general education instructional population.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 ELLs reaching proficiency on the NYSESLAT continue to receive additional support in all modalities through our content based 
curriculum that is aligned to the common core standard.  They continued to be provided with support in small group 
instruction. Furthermore, they continue to participate in various field trips exposing them to the city’s cultural diversity 
affording them the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussion that continues to support their language development skills 
particularly in listening and speaking. Our school is affiliated with the College Board Readiness Program. Through this affiliation 
our ELLs are exposed to a rigorous curriculum that will prepare all students for high school graduation and college admission.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          72

We will be reviewing our school budget to determine how to increase additional support to our ELL population. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No programs will be discontinued 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELLs students are provided with the opportunity to participate in all academic and extra-curricular activities as the general 
education population. The YMCA is our after school program which affords ELLs and general education students the 
opportunity to engage in extra-curricular activities as well as provide them with academic support through the YScholar 
program.      
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Our ELLs are supported through the use of technology to reinforce the ENL/ELA strategies learned during the regular day. In 
addition, they participate in balanced literacy instruction with the use of classroom libraries that are geared to their levels of 
reading readiness. Our classroom libraries have various books in the different content areas such as math, science, and social 
studies, as well as books in Spanish.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 All Spanish speaking ELLs receive a minimum of 100 minutes a week of native language instruction. Students receive native 
language support through the variety of books in our classroom libraries. Classroom libraries have books in the different 
content areas such as math, science, and social Studies, as well as books in Spanish.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services support and resources correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Our ELLs are supported through the use of technology to reinforce the ENL/ELA strategies learned during the regular day. In 
addition, they participate in balanced literacy instruction with the use of classroom libraries that are geared to their levels of 
reading readiness. Our classroom libraries have various books in the different content areas such as math, science, and social 
studies, as well as books in Spanish.    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We  invite our new arrivals and newly enrolled students to participate in various activities during the first week of August. 
These activities are cultural and instructional in order to prepare them for our school’s academic goals, while at the same time 
familiarizing them with the New York City culture.    
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is the language elective offered to our students.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Nalini Singh, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
