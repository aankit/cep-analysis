Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is to help all students, regardless of background, become independent and productive members of our 
community to the greatest extent possible. In 2017-2018, our stakeholders collaborated to craft our mission, vision 
and core values. Through this collaboration, we established that the two words that describe the 721Q community 
are: "WE CARE". This acronym represents: W-Welcome (Welcome families, students and staff), E-Empathy 
(Understand other people’s feelings and opinions), C-Community (Work together to achieve independence in school 
and the community), A-Advocacy (Advocate for access and equity for our students), R-Respect (Trust and treat each 
other with respect and dignity) and E-Excellence (Commit to educate and perform every task with excellence). The 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

core values that drive our work daily are: Compassion, Dedication, Diversity, Independence, Recognition, Safety, and 
Teamwork. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Our school currently serves 500 high school age students (14-21), who have a broad range of abilities and challenges, 
which may include but are not limited to students on the autism spectrum, students with severe to profound 
cognitive challenges, and students with multiple disabilities. The school is comprised of a self-contained main site, 
which houses thirty-five (35) classes inclusive of Spanish-Bilingual, English as a New Language (ENL), and in-school and 
community based work-study classes. There are three (3) co-located satellite sites at Info Tech High School, Maspeth 
High School, and Queens College. Info Tech serves seven (7) classes including two community based work study 
classes and two inclusion classes. The Maspeth Campus serves eight (8) classes and the Queens College Campus has 
two (2) classes of students who participate in inclusive education and work study both on and off campus.  

Students attending the John F. Kennedy Jr. School/P 721Q receive the opportunity to participate in all content areas 
receiving rigorous academic education that gives them access to the general education curriculum. Students are also 
offered opportunities to participate in vocational and Career Development and Occupational Standards (CDOS) 
courses both in and outside of the school, where students learn work related skills in the areas of maintenance, food 
service, retail and clerical work. Among our CTE (Career Technical Education) clusters classes we offer carpentry, retail 
store, library services, publishing, PAES (Practical Assessment Exploration System), culinary arts and a coffee shop.  

The variety of academic courses and vocational experiences offered at the John F. Kennedy Jr. HS/P721Q prepare 
students for the transition from school to post-secondary life as mandated by their Individual Education Transition 
Programs. It should be noted that post-21 placement and services have become exponentially more difficult for 
parents to obtain since the enactment of the new “front door” protocol. Agencies are now more likely to pick 
students with work-study experience as candidates over those students without previous exposure to work 
environments. To address this need, JFK Jr. students from 16-21 are involved in community based instruction and 
work-study experiences in-school and/or out in the community. 

Given the preponderance of students in our school who struggle to communicate, the 721Q community decided that 
student-to-student communication should be our instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year. Population based 
rubrics were developed by our professional learning communities to assess progress toward achieving the 
instructional focus and to establish individualized next steps. We have also increase our knowledge and awareness of 
the use of communication systems to give every student a voice, regardless if it is with the use of communication 
devices or verbally. 

During the 2017-2018 school year, we started a collaboration with AHRC, Project Search and New York Presbyterian 
Hospital in Queens to provide internships at the NY Presbyterian Hospital for students in their last year of school. 
Through Project Search the selected 12 students participated in three individual rotations as interns working with 
department mentors and a job coach. Having our first Project Search class gave us the opportunity to reflect on our 
own practices regarding transition. In order to better support and prepare our students for the next stage of their 
lives, we organized our classes into tiers in a "Continuum of Student Supports". This new organizational structure 
gives us clear guidelines for expectations and skills to be teach at each level. It also creates consistency by having all 
stakeholders on the same page when articulating students and planning their future. Through the implementation of 
our "Tiered Workstudy Program" we will challenge each and every learner giving them the rigorous instruction 
needed for IEP goals to be mastered and make them as independent as possible. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Populations: 12:1:1, 8:1:1, 6:1:1, 9:1:3 and 12:1:4. Specific classifications: students with intellectual delays, students 
with autism, students with emotional disturbance and students with multiple disabilities and other health 
impairments. Needs: social emotional support, differentiated instruction to provide access to the general education 
curriculum, related services, instruction of daily living skills, community based instruction, vocational experiences, 
medical care. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our area of greatest progress is Rigorous Instruction. Specifically, implementing a "Continuum of Student Supports"- 
our workstudy tiered system to better prepare our students for transition. In order to bring 721Q’s instructional 
practices into alignment with District 75’s focus on academic rigor for students with special needs, we have developed 
a vocational assessment aligned to the New York State's Level 3 Vocational Assessments and Exit Summaries for 
Alternate Assessment students. 

Our area of focus is Strong Family and Community Ties - our PA and Parent Workshop attendance dropped during the 
2017-18 school year. We are going to focus on strategies for increasing family participation such as establishing bi-
monthly night events such as "Movie Nights" and "School Dances" to give our families a chance to attend workshops 
and social groups while students enjoy recreational activities with their peers.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P721Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P721Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P721Q , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

OVERVIEW OF SCHOOL-DAY PROGRAM AND SERVICES FOR ELLS AT 721Q, THE 
JOHN F KENNEDY SCHOOL 
The John F. Kennedy Jr. school, P721Q is part of the District 75 citywide programs for students 
with significant disabilities. 721Q is a school for students ages 14.5 to 21 with moderate to 
severe disabilities in grades 8 through 12. There are 489 students in our school organization. 
Thirteen (13) BIS-mandated ELLs have alternate placement paraprofessionals. The languages of 
the alternate placement paraprofessionals are: Bengali, Chinese, Haitian-Creole, Polish, Punjabi, 
and Spanish. 
All ELLs who were on our register last Spring participated in the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT. It is 
important to note that all ELLs at 721Q have significant cognitive disabilities and have an 
alternative assessment mandate in their IEPs.  The NYSESLAT is not an appropriate tool for 
measuring language proficiency for ELLs with an alternate assessment mandate. 
DESCRIPTION OF THE DIRECT SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM: 
Type of Program/activities: Title III Saturday Instructional, Professional Development, and 
Parental Involvement Program entitled “The Amazing Race: Building English Language Skills 
Through Multi-Cultural Music, Dance, Games/Sports, and Food” 
For school year 2018 - 2019, P721Q will provide Saturday supplemental Title III  language 
instruction to 46 ELLs as follows: Sixteen (16) ELLs will receive instruction in two 8:1:1 class 
ratios. Two bilingual paraprofessionals will provide support to the program.  Twenty four (24) 
ELLs will receive instruction in two 12:1:1 class ratios.  Two bilingual paraprofessional will 
provide support to those students.  Six (6) ELLs will receive instruction in a 6:1:1 class 
ratio.  One bilingual paraprofessional will provide support to those students. In addition to the 
representation of Spanish-speaking parents in all class ratios, we enjoyed increased participation 
by Bengali-speaking, Haitian-Creole-speaking, and Chinese-speaking parents in our Title III 
program.  As we did last year, this year we will continue to employ two additional bilingual 
paraprofessionals (Spanish and Chinese) as  "floaters" to interpret for Chinese-speaking or 
Spanish-speaking parents in the mixed language classes. These floaters will also assist students 
who need toileting or behavioral support. Based on the language needs of students and parents 
during previous Title III programs at our school, the languages of the paraprofessionals, at a 
minimum, shall be as follows: Bengali, Chinese, Haitian-Creole, and Spanish. 
P721Q’s 2018-2019 Title III Saturday supplemental language instruction program for English 
language learners with an alternative assessment IEP mandate will been entitled "The Amazing 
Race: Building English Language Skills through Multicultural Music, Dance, Games/Sports and 
Food." 
The program will focus on supporting students’ acquisition of listening, speaking, reading, and 
writing skills in English, integrating technology and in reinforcing students’ language skills 
through: 1) participation in music, dance, games/sports, and culinary activities from cultures 
around the world, 2) research of music, dance, games/sports, and foods from various cultures, 
and 3) application of safe practices and choices in their daily lives. Parents work and learn along-
side their youngsters throughout the program, engaging in multicultural music, dance, 
games/sports, and culinary arts and project-based activities, conducting research using the

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Internet, creating international genre posters, a multicultural calendar of the program's theme 
(i.e., music, dance, games/sports, culinary arts) and cultural activities that students can engage in 
with their peers and/or parents. Parents, staff, and students will use hand-held tech devices (e.g., 
iPad mini, digital cameras) to record and research their music, dance, games/sports, and culinary 
arts activities.  Using ENL methodologies and scaffolds, teachers will help students explore 
theme-based activities practiced in various cultures around the world and how instruments, 
games, music, and foods are played and made. Lessons will include a spotlight on the language, 
vocabulary, social expressions, and communicative etiquette, materials and practices needed to 
ensure safe participation in the program's themed activities. 
Instruction during this Saturday program is in English using ENL methodologies and some 
native language support. Research supports the use of the native language in ENL settings (O 
Garcia & L Wei, 2014). Native language support will not merely include oral interpretation, 
written translations, and/or code-switching. It will include flexible language use (e.g., 
Translanguaging) that encourages students to use their complete language repertoire to:  make 
themselves understood, express creativity and critically (Wei, 2011), make certain that they've 
understood, contrast and compare different language singularities, and mix languages according 
to circumstances, need, and situation (Gunnarsson, 2015).  
Concepts and skills will also be reinforced with the assistance of bilingual (Spanish/English, 
Chinese/English, Bengali/English, Haitian-Creole/English, and other language(s), as necessary, 
paraprofessionals. Tasks performed by students during this Title III Saturday instructional 
program are aligned to the New York State Common Core ELA and mathematics standards via 
the NYSAA DLM Essential Elements (EEs), to the NYSAA social studies Alternate Grade level 
indicators (AGLIs), and to the NYS Home Language Arts Progressions (replaced the old ESL 
standards), and to the technology standards.  
Five classes will be formed to serve the forty-six (46) ELL students as follows: 
Two  classes of 12 students and two class of 8 students, and one class of 6:1:1 will participate in 
the Title III program. All 46 ELL students work with the certified bilingual and/or certified ESL 
teachers building their listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in English. 
A school administrator is needed to ensure that all compliance and instructional components are 
met. Three paraprofessionals (Bengali, Chinese, and Spanish) will translate instructional 
materials and materials for parents. Bilingual teachers and bilingual paraprofessionals will 
provide oral interpretation for parents during activities. 
Six certified bilingual and/or ENL teachers will ensure that all forty-six students receive direct 
instruction through ENL methodologies from a certified bilingual teacher. 
Two class of 8 students and one class of 6 ELLs students from a variety of 
language backgrounds  (e.g., Chinese, Bengali, Spanish, etc.) will be instructed in 8:1:1 and 
6:1:1 student-to-staff ration by 3 certified bilingual or certified ENL teachers.  Three bilingual 
paraprofessionals will work with theses 8:1:1 and 6:1:1 classes.  
Two classes of 12 students per class will be instructed as follows: The first class will be 
comprised of 12 ELL students and their parents. A Spanish-speaking paraprofessional will 
accompany that group to serve as interpreter for parents and to provide native language 
instructional support, as needed, to students.  Two  bilingual (e.g., Bengali/English, Haitian-
Creole/English) paraprofessional "floaters" will provide additional language and other support 
and rotate among the two classes of students and parents.  It should be noted that some ELLs are 
instructed in a 12:1:4 ratio during the school day. The additional bilingual paraprofessionals will 
facilitate instruction in group with these students, should such students attend the program this 
year. Moreover, most students at 721Q are not independent travelers and require bussing. The 
District does not provide funds for bussing students at 721Q  after school or on the weekend. 
Participation of parents alongside their youngsters in the program not only provides a way for 
our students to access the Title III supplemental instructional program, since parents take their 
children to the program, but also provides an opportunity for parents to be directly involved in

2008).  Therefore, we will provide Metrocards for parents and students. 
RATIONALE for 721Q Saturday program with students and parents with ENL focus: 
•             Research underscores the benefits of integrating culinary arts into the 
curriculum.   According to Henderson, “[t]he incorporation of culinary arts as a project-based 
learning activity is an excellent way to increase student knowledge and engagement.” Overall, 
students' content-knowledge, long-term memory of content, and their joy and appreciation of the 
art itself is also enhanced.  (S. Henderson, 2014) 
In her blog, Rebekah Stathakis (2016) calls attention to the following benefits of using games in 
the classroom: 
"•           Students learn through the process of playing games (e.g., be able to understand a new 
concept or idea, take on a different perspective, or experiment with different options or 
variables.) 
•             Games provide a context for engaging practice (e.g., repeated meaningful practice to 
internalize important vocabulary and structures). 
•             Through games, students can learn a variety of important skills. (e.g., critical thinking 
skills, creativity, teamwork, and good sportsmanship.) 
•             While playing games, students develop a variety of connections with the content and 
can form positive memories of learning. (e.g., A positive emotional connection can facilitate 
learning, many games feature a variety of different stimuli; some students might remember the 
vocabulary words from acting them out, others remember reading the clues, and other students 
remember hearing classmates call out answers. Games can provide a variety of sensory 
experiences for students.) 
•             Games grab students’ attention and actively engage them. (e.g., After a fire drill 
students sometimes have trouble settling down and returning to class. A game allows students to 
quickly engage and transition back to the content we were working on.)"  (Education World, 
2013) 
•             Communication and Socialization are the greatest areas of deficit for students with 
severe disabilities: (Reichle, J. & Wacker, D.P., 1993) (Jackson, R.M., 2011) The “Makes Me 
Happy: Music Around the World: Building English Language Skills through Music and Dance” 
program will provide learning experiences for our ELLs and EP students in our DL program to 
practice and generalize communication and socialization skills in a natural, motivating, 
functionally/culturally-relevant, and practical manner. Research supports the use of technology 
to help improve student achievement (J. Cummins, 2003), (D. Tater and M. Robinson, 2003), 
(EducationWorld, 2011). 
SUBGROUP AND GRADE LEVELS OF STUDENTS TO BE SERVED:

 RATIONALE  PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: 
 
Research supports: 
•             the use of transdisciplinary teaming for working with students with significant 
disabilities (Pugach, M. C. & Johnson, L. J. (1995), Orelove and Sobsey, 1996); 
•             lessons for ELLs and students with disabilities that incorporate hands-on, functional 
activities (Bredderman, 1982), 
•             peer-facilitated professional development (Galbraith and Anstrom, 1995), and 
•             the importance of parent participation in the education of ELLs (R. Waterman & B. 
Harry, 2008). 
These features form the basis of our Title III program. 
 
PROGRAMS FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS WORKING TOGETHER: (also see 
transportation issues under instructional rationale) 
Our Saturday Instructional Program involves Parents and Students working together. Teachers 
need support in gaining, building, and utilizing knowledge re: working with culturally and 
linguistically diverse families, culture, language, and disabilities, in order to provide effective 
instruction to ELLs with disabilities (Harry, B., 2008) (Colorin Colorado, 2007) 
PD FACILITATED BY SUPERVISOR & ROTATING TEACHERS 
PD FOCUS ON TEAM-BUILDING, LESSON PLANNING, AND PARENTAL 
INVOLVEMENT:  (Also see research support & rationale under instructional rationale section.) 
•             Home-school collaboration and transdisciplinary, collaborative teaming for instruction 
and assessment are essential components of effective instructional programs for students with 
severe disabilities (Ford, A., Schnoor, R., Meyer, L.,Davern, L., Black, J., & Dempsey, 
P.,  2003) (Rainforth, B., York, J. M. & MacDonald, C., 1992) and for working with ELLs with 
disabilities (Baca, L.M. & Cervantes, H.T., 2004). 
•             NYSED’s recommended thematic unit format for instructing ELLs (i.e., the Learning 
Experience) (NYSED “The Teaching of English Language Arts to English Language Learners: 
A Resource Guide for All Teachers” (2000). 
•             Content of PD will cover lesson-planning, cross-cultural issues, multicultural etiquette, 
interpretation and translation, confidentiality, and using the Learning Experience format as a 
vehicle for teaching ELLs through themes-the importance of including these issues in training 
for teachers of ELLs is supported by research (Zehr, M.A., 2011) and law (BRYCS, 2012).

Chinese, Spanish, Bengali, Haitian-Creole, etc.),  and an administrator will participate in a five 
week PD Institute. Teachers & paras will participate from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM (to be held one 
day a week for 5 weeks, on a weekday) 
SCHEDULE AND DURATION: PD will be on-going and sustained and will run one day a 
week, 3 hours per day, for five weeks, after school for teachers and paraprofessionals. 
Administrator's official hours are from 7:30 am to 3:30 pm. 
TOPICS TO BE COVERED:  The GOAL of our professional development academy is: 
 1) to explore strategies for teaching ELLs with significant cognitive disabilities, using "The 
Amazing Race" as a theme, 
2) to explore issues that impact on teaching and learning as they relate to ELLs with disabilities, 
and 
3) to create materials to be used with students and parents (e.g., written materials, multisensory 
materials and symbols and pictures to use in communication). 
Topics to be covered include: Effective Instructional Approaches and Strategies for Working 
with ELLs with Significant Disabilities, Data Collection and Assessment, Working with 
Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Parents, Creating age-appropriate, culturally relevant 
activities and materials to be used with students and parents.

RATIONALE FOR JOINT PARENT/STUDENT TITLE III  SATURDAY PROGRAM: 
PARENTS  WILL PARTICIPATE WITH THEIR YOUNGSTERS: Parent participation is vital 
for the successful instruction of ELLs with disabilities (NCLB, Title III) (also see research & 
rationale in instructional and PD sections).  Parent participation impacts immediate and post 
school outcomes for minority, culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD), and disabled 
youngsters (Baca, L., 1991), (Pleet, A, 2000). Arias and Morillo note that “Logistics is an area 
that limits ELL parent presence in schools. ELL parents often have labor-intensive work 
schedules, which limit their ability to attend events and "transportation needs may affect the 
ability of students to stay after school for tutoring or extra-curricular activities” (Arias, M.B. and 
Morillo-Campbell, M., 2008). For these reasons, it is important to provide both traditional 
(Epstein, J.L., 1992) and non-traditional (Arias, M.B. and Morillo-Campbell, M., 2008) ways for 
culturally and linguistically diverse parents of ELLs to participate in their children’s education. 
Therefore, parent participation is important in this Title III program for ELLs with significant 
cognitive disabilities at the high school level. Moreover, “Research and practice have both 
demonstrated that parent involvement is central to academic achievement: Schools that support 
meaningful parent involvement have higher levels of student achievement, improved school 
attendance, higher graduation rates, larger enrollment in post-secondary education and students 
with positive attitudes about school." (e.g., August & Hakuta, 1997; Henderson & Berla, 1994). 
"Parent involvement can also help students be more engaged with school and motivated to work

hard" (López, 2001). All ELL students in the 721Q Title III program, except for one independent 
traveler, require transportation via the school bus during the school day. Students are not travel-
trained and bussing is not available for non-school-day hours (i.e., before/after school and 
weekends).  Therefore parents must escort their youngsters to and from the Title III Saturday 
instructional program. The 721Q Title III program has been set up to accommodate participants 
by integrating parents into the instructional program with their youngsters (e.g., Parents will 
participate with their youngsters in music, dance, sports/games, and culinary arts activities and 
will also create digital folios of their work and activities with their youngsters.). 
SCHEDULE AND DURATION: Parents will attend the Saturday Title III “Amazing Race” 
program alongside their youngsters. Parents will attend the Saturday Title III program with their 
youngsters that will run for 7 Saturdays, 4 hours each Saturday. 
TOPICS TO BE COVERED: Parents are fully integrated into the 721Q Title III Saturday 
program. Parents will work alongside their youngsters each day of the Saturday program, with 
the assistance of teachers who will observe student/parent interactions and model effective 
strategies for engaging their youngsters and promoting communicative interaction among parents 
and students. The parents will join students and staff to participate in integrated communication 
and socialization-focused recreational activities (playing music, creating recipes, games, 
songs/music, posters,  instruments and playing cards, etc.) and to learn of follow-up activities 
that they can do at home and in the community to help reinforce and provide practice and 
generalization for concepts that their youngsters worked on in the instructional program.  
Parents will participate in the morning themes routine (e.g., “What Music Do I Listen To?”) with 
their youngsters (from 8:00 AM to 10:15 AM). Following the warm-up, they will accompany 
their youngsters to their (“concurrent”) classes. (Parents remain with their youngsters in the 
concurrent classes throughout the day Parents will rotate from class-to-class during the first two 
hours of the concurrent class sessions, assisting parents in working with their children during 
instruction, modeling interactions, and suggesting modifications. 
HOW PARENTS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THESE ACTIVITIES: 
Parents will receive the Title III parent notification letter (from the NYCDOE website) in their 
preferred languages.  The letter will be modified by 721Q staff to provide specific information 
regarding our “The Amazing Race: Building Language Skills through Multicultural Music, 
Dance, Games/Sports, and Foods ” Saturday supplemental Title III program. We anticipate that a 
minimum of 20 parents will participate.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
All English language learners (ELLs) in our school organization are between the ages of 14.9 and 21, have severe cognitive 
disabilities, and are mandated to participate in alternate assessments.  New York State has not yet created an alternate 
assessment for its English Language Proficiency (ELP) tests (i.e., NYSITELL, NYSESLAT), as mandated by the U.S. Department of 
Education, for our students. Assessment tools that 721Q uses to assess early literacy skills are developed for students with 
severe cognitive, sensory, and other disabilities (e.g., deaf/hard of hearing, speech impairment, visual impairment, physical 
disability, etc.) who are also ELLs. These assessment tools include teacher-made assessments, a State assessment, and 
commercial assessments as follows:  
 
• Teacher-created rubric-based assessments that include a look at whether or not: 
a) a student communicates with intent and purpose and engages in student-to student-communication 
b) a student is able to generalize skills across settings, in a variety of social interactions, and with a variety of conversation 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

partners (e.g., in re-telling a story, in sharing information about author’s purpose of different texts) and print, and 
c) whether or not a student requires cues, prompts, and/or scaffolds (including the duration of these supports and how they 
may be faded to reduce the strength of the cues and/or prompts).  
 
•  Our students access the Common Core Learning Standards, including the literacy standards via the New York State Alternate 
Assessment (NYSAA) in ELA (English Language Arts). The NYSAA assesses mastery of all four modalities (speaking, listening, 
reading and writing). Currently, the NYSAA is a computer-based and datafolio-type assessment that includes student work, 
videos, photographs, and/or data collection sheets that document the student’s accuracy in performing tasks that are aligned 
to content standards, via Alternate Grade Level Indicators  to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) in the following 
areas: Science and Social Studies; and Essential Elements for ELA and Math; Reading Standards for Literature (RL.11.2), 
Reading Standards for Informational Text (RL.11.1), Writing (Text Types and Purposes) (W.11.1), Speaking and Listening 
(Presentation of Knowledge and Ideas) (SL.11.4), and Language (Conventions of Standard English) (L.11.2).   
•    Mastery of annual IEP goals related to language and literacy is assessed via the Student Annual Needs Determination 
Inventory (SANDI). 
•    The BRIGANCE (Brigance Diagnostic of Basic Skills – Spanish) (“Evaluación de Habilidades de Lenguaje y Aprendizaje Basico” 
is used to assess language and math skills of ELLs in the Spanish TBE program.  
•   The English and Spanish versions of the Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills – Revised (ABLLS-R) (Assessment 
of Basic Language and Learning Skills – Revised/Evaluación de habilidades de lenguaje y aprendizaje básico ) are administered 
in Spanish and English.  Assessments such as EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, etc. are neither age-appropriate nor 
cognitively appropriate for our high-school-aged ELLs who have severe disabilities. Students who have a dual classification of 
English Language Learner (ELL) and disability classification of intellectual disability face significant challenges in acquiring and 
building their language/communication skills.  At 721Q, informal assessments, and rubric-based assessments are conducted in 
English and the native language(s).  The data from these assessments reflect the findings in research that state that students 
with disabilities require additional time and multiple and varied opportunities to practice using skills across environments, in 
order to master these skills. Our students do better when literacy-based materials contain culturally-relevant and functionally 
applicable content (materials that provide them with natural connections to new content).  Assessments must be modified for 
these students. Assessments for students in our Dual Language program will also be conducted in Spanish and English. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

A structure in place to support our ENL teachers are PLN (Professional Learning Networks).  These are periods where teachers 
can get together to discuss and learn from each other on best practices to work with our ELL students. Another structure in 
place to support this effort is ENL workshops, which allows teachers to ‘turn-key’ (teach) information to their colleagues. The 
school’s ENL Coach will host  Professional Development to teach teachers new strategies to work with students will ENL 
classification and dual classification of ELL and disability classification. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use the results of their performance on the ELA NYSAA, SANDI Assessment, weekly IEP data collection, and on mastery of 
their annual IEP goals related to language and mathematics.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Students are given various prompt levels to achieve their IEP goals, they are given class work and homework that target 
a  specific area they need to develop on,  are placed in classes that work best with their needs as indicated by an annual 
evaluation of student progress in their IEP.  During PLNs, teachers analyze and discuss IEP data collection, share best practices 
through intervisitation which address student needs and interventions.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A  We are a high school for students with severe disabilities. All of our students are ages 14.9 to 21, have disabilities and are 
instructed according to their IEP mandates and their progress towards meeting content-area standards (CCLS) is assessed via 
the NYSAA.     

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
(202 students) Who were on our attendance register in the Spring of 2016 were administered the Spring 2016 NYSESLAT. 
However, only 146 students received a reportable score as follows: 40 Entering (beginners), 85 Emerging (low intermediate), 
18 Transitioning (intermediate), and 03 Expanding (advanced). Fifty-five (56) students did not receive a score presumably 
because "A student must receive a valid score on all four modalities in order to receive a proficiency level" (NYSED August 
2015 memorandum from Steven E. Katz). Moreover, and more importantly, the results of the Spring 2016 New York State 
English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) scores for our students are inconclusive and invalid. Our ELLs all 
have disabilities and are instructed according to their IEP mandates. None of our ELLs should take standardized assessments as 
they are all mandated to take alternate assessments. However, because New York State has not complied with the federal 
mandate to create an alternate assessment to the English Language Proficiency exams (i.e., NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT), our 
students are mandated to take these standardized exams that are invalid instruments for assessing language proficiency for 
students with significant cognitive disabilities. An analysis of data patterns across performance levels under these 
circumstances would be inappropriate and purposeless.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Some structures we have in place to disseminate these findings are that we have a data coordinator, ENL coach, scoring teams 
and administration who share information regarding the ELL population who need to take the NYSESLAT exam as well as their 
scores on this exam. This information is shared via paper and electronic means (through google docs and excel spreadsheets.) 
Teachers also share information regarding ELL students with parents, related service providers and paraprofessionals when 
applicable or necessary. Our school’s ENL coach also uses compliance documents 2, 3,  and 4 in which ENL, Bilingual and dual 
language teachers input their schedules and how many ELL students are enrolled in their class. This provides accuracy for the 
amount of teachers of ELLs and ELL students and teachers are able to make changes to their schedule and amount of ELLs 
enrolled when necessary. This information is shared with the ENL coach, teachers of ELLs and the school administration and 
can be shared with other faculty members whenever deemed necessary or appropriate.  

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], 

homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

All classes at 721Q are ungraded. Students are grouped according to the student-to-staff ratio mandated in their IEPs and they are never grouped in greater than a three year age span (in accordance with the Regulations of the Commissioner of education section 200). ENL and TBE classes are homogeneous, since most 
students are at the Entering level of second language acquisition.  Semi-self-contained means students remain with their ENL teacher for their mandated minutes of ENL services (i.e., 540 minutes/12 periods per week). All ENL classes (classes following a block schedule) are grouped heterogeneously. Instruction is centered on 
teaching students the skills needed to master the New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP) standards, content area standards, CDOS standards, and IEP goals. This is accomplished, in part, by providing students with opportunities to demonstrate accurate and independent performance of tasks linked to the CCLS via Essential 
Elements to the ELA NYSAA at the high school level.  721Q has ten (10) “semi-self-contained” (ENL-only classes) in three different service categories (student-to-staff ratios of 12:1:1, 8:1:1, and 6:1:1). These classes follow a block schedule and receive ENL instruction via an integrated model. Certified ESOL teachers provides the 
540 minutes of ENL instruction (360 minutes of free-standing ENL and 180 minutes of integrated ENL in the content areas) as follows:•  360 minutes (8 periods) of  free-standing ENL•  90 minutes (2 periods) of ENL through mathematics•  45 minutes (1 period) of ENL through science•  45 minutes (1 period) of ENL through 
social studies 
In this manner, the certified ESOL teachers in the "V" bridge provides 56 ELLs in 12:1:1 student-to-staff ratio with 540 minutes of ENL instruction per week. The certified ESOL teachers in the "X" bridge provides 22 ELLs in 8:1:1 student-to-staff ratio with 540 minutes of ENL      per week. The certified ESOL teachers in the "Y" 
bridge provides 22 ELLs in 6:1:1 student-to-staff ratio with 540 minutes of ENL per week. In addition, English instruction for students in all service categories (12:1:1, 12:1:4, 6:1:1, 8:1:1, and work-study) who do not attend a semi-self contained freestanding ENL class,  is delivered via a stand-alone model. All classes are at the 
high school level. The number of students who participate in the stand-alone model varies (e.g., depending on when they enter our school after September and according to their physical placement –e.g., at our Queens College site). The stand-alone model also provides ENL services for those ENL-Only mandated students who 
have  alternate placement paraprofessionals who are not in a semi-self-contained ENL class. Students in our free standing semi-self-contained ENL classes travel together as a group.  For the remaining periods, students in semi-self-contained ENL classes participate in other classes such as culinary arts, music, dance, industrial 
arts, crafts, physical education/APE, and computers, which are conducted in English by certified special education teachers, all of whom have received 10 hours Jose P. training provided by the District 75 OELL, and some of whom also have TESOL Master's degrees (but do not hold ESOL (English to Speakers of other Languages) 
certification.  In the stand-alone model, the certified ESOL teachers help students by facilitating small groups in guided reading which is a component of the balanced literacy program. Students mandated for free-standing ENL services attend one of the following class ratios:5 semi-self-contained free standing ENL 12:1:1 
classes3 semi-self-contained free standing ENL 6:1:1 classes2 semi-self-contained free standing ENL 8:1:1 classes1 Pull-Out Free-Standing ENL library and literacy instruction provided by our teacher certified in special education, ESOL, and library services1 certified ESOL Teacher is the dean at one of our off-sites. 
All ENL classes also offer home language support such as access to bilingual dictionaries, bilingual glossaries, bilingual illustrated texts, bilingual literary texts, bilingual informational text, bilingual e-books, bilingual software programs/APPs, bilingual alternate placement paraprofessionals, scaffolding and prompting.

        Currently, there are  two Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) classes at 721Q. Certified bilingual special education teachers in one 12:1:1 TBE Spanish class and one 8:1:1 TBE class for students with autism provide home language instruction and ENL instruction to our ELL students with intellectual disabilities (SWD) at the 
high school level. Most students (47%) in all of our TBE classes are at the Entering level (beginner level) of second language acquisition while 21% are at the Emerging Level, 21% of the students received a no score and two students were admitted after the NYSESLAT was administered, therefore they do not have a score 
(10%).  All students receive a minimum of 12 periods/540 minutes of ENL instruction per week.   Language is allocated at a 60/40 percent split (60% in English, 40% in L1).  Grouping is heterogeneous, students are instructed together in a no-greater- than 3 year age span. Teachers are certified bilingual with an ESOL Extension 
or with an ESOL certification. Should a bilingual teacher not possess an ESOL extension or certificate, one of the ESOL certified teachers will teach that bilingual teacher's students during the 12 periods (540 minutes of ENL instruction). Paraprofessionals in our TBE programs are bilingual in the languages of the students. 
Instruction in the TBE program is aligned to the CCLS via NYSAA Essential Elements in ELA and mathematics. Home Language Arts Progressions (HLAP) standards and New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP) standards are addressed using NYSAA Essential Elements and assessment tasks. Science and social studies instruction is 
aligned to the NYS Common Core in those areas and to their corresponding alternate grade level indicators (AGLIs). Bilingual students who participate in work study programs or in service categories where no bilingual class is available (i.e. Spanish 12:1:4), will be served. These students will be provided with an alternate 
placement paraprofessional fluent in their native language and will  receive 540 minutes of ENL stand-alone or integrated services from a certified ESOL teacher. Students also receive bilingual related services such as bilingual speech services and bilingual counseling, if mandated on their IEPs.           721Q ELL staff recognize 
the importance of the student’s native language in teaching and learning. Therefore, we ensure that materials are prepared and available for our ELL students with disabilities (ELL SWD) in the student’s native language.  Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, computer software, and other materials are 
available for students in the TBE program in their L1 and in L2. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We were awarded a Dual Language Planning Grant in May, 2015 and  opened two Dual Language (Spanish) 12:1:1 classes during the  2015-2016 school year. Our DL program is aligned to the CCLS and address HLAPs, NLAPs , content area, and CDOS standards, using Essential Elements from the NYSAA at the high school 
level.  The 22 students in our DL program follow a block schedule (10 students are in the first class (V50) with an ENL teacher and the second group of 12 students is with the bilingual (Spanish) special education teacher in class (V51).  Each of these 2 groups of students travel together: 1 EP and 9 ELL students from the first 
class (V50) spend part of the day with the ENL teacher and then travel to receive instruction from the bilingual (Spanish) special education teacher. Each group , 5 EP and 7 ELL students from the second class (V51) travel together and receive HLA/Spanish instruction from the bilingual special education teacher.  All classes are 
ungraded and students are grouped heterogeneously, most ELLs are at the Emerging level of English language proficiency, according to their NYSESLAT scores.  

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 below)? 

   
    721Q ensures that the mandated minutes of ENL and home language instruction are provided for our English language learner (ELL)    students with disabilities (SWD) in each program model as follows:1. Our ENL Coach, SBST school psychologist, and our Data Coordinator collaborate to review the language mandates of our ELLs and 
for new students entering our school.  If changes need to be made in SESIS to reflect student’s ELL language needs, this is done via the IEP process (e.g., Requested Review, Annual Review, or Triennial).2. The ENL Coach uses information from the RLAT to generate a list of ELLs that includes their proficiency levels, based on the latest 
available NYSESLAT scores. At the end of the school year or during an Educational Planning Conference (EPC) (e.g., during annual review, triennial, requested review), ENL teachers make recommendations for future placement based on their students’ performance. 3. Administrators assign ELLs to Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE), 
Dual Language (DL), or Stand-alone ENL (ENL-Only/Free-Standing) classes based on information received from the ENL Coach regarding student’s ELL-status mandate recorded on ATS, NYSESLAT scores, and based on information received from the certified ESOL (English to Speakers of other Languages) teacher or certified bilingual 
teacher regarding student’s present level of performance, strengths and needs, student-to-staff  ratio mandate, language needs, annual goals, and other mandated services agreed upon by parent, teacher, and other service providers during EPCs, as recorded in student’s IEP. 4. In Our TBE and DL Classes: Each teacher reviews his/her 
ELL SWD’s IEP and uses the District 75 OELL compliance documents to list, organize, and create a schedule that reflects the minimum units of ENL and home language usage and supports mandated by C.R. Part 154. 5. Each certified ESOL and certified bilingual teacher dedicates twelve (12) periods per week (540 minutes) to delivery of 
direct, explicit ENL instruction that is aligned to the New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP) standards and to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) via the ELA NYSAA Essential Elements to the CCLS. This instruction is conducted via a stand-alone model. Certified bilingual teachers in our TBE program (and our certified bilingual 
and certified ESOL teachers who teach in the Dual Language program that was opened during the 2015-2016 school year,  also dedicate a minimum of 4 periods per week (180 minutes) to delivery of direct, explicit home language instruction that is aligned to the Home Language Arts Progressions (HLAP) standards and to the Common 
Core Learning Standards (CCLS) via the ELA NYSAA Extensions to the CCLS. Tasks are taken from the ELA NYSAA but students perform them in the native language for L1 (first language) instructional purposes but not for NYSAA ELA instruction and assessment. In addition, students in the TBE program receive 4 periods (180 minutes) of 
content area instruction delivered in the home language (e.g., 1 period of science delivered in the first language, 1 period of mathematics delivered in the L1 , 1 period of social studies delivered in the first language, and 1 period of language arts delivered in the first language). For the remainder of the day, students are instructed with 
non-ELLs by certified special education teachers in classes such as physical education/adaptive physical education (APE), music, art, dance, culinary arts, computer lab, and industrial arts. The chart below is a sample schedule of how this 60/40 model (60% in English/40% in L1) is delivered at 721Q:

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards.  

 
Teachers in all ENL programs at 721Q (i.e., TBE, Free-Standing ENL, DL since September 2015) follow our school's curriculum which is aligned to the CCLS and addresses students' second language acquisition needs, IEP goals, and Career Development/Occupational Studies (CDOS) standards. To make content comprehensible and to 
foster language development, instruction is delivered in both English and in the home language in bilingual programs; and home language supports (e.g., bilingual books, illustrations, audio, bilingual support staff) are provided for students in free-standing ENL programs who need these supports. Curriculum and instruction for ELLs in 
all of our programs follow Universal Design for Learning (UDL) guidelines (e.g., provide multiple means of engagement, provide multiple means of representation, provide multiple means of action and expression) and principles of backwards design (e.g., We begin with the standards: What must our students know and be able to do ; 
We include overarching goals such as developing purposeful, motivated learners, resourceful, knowledgeable learners, and strategic, goal-directed learners linked to UDL principles [Wiggins and McTighe, 1997] [Rose, D.H. & Gravel, J.W., 210]). Technology is infused into instruction. Students read and attend to/listen to web-based and 
hard-copy books in the home language and in English. Instruction in all ENL programs is differentiated.           Technology is integrated throughout our programs for our ELL SWD and instructional materials include high/low tech augmentative/alternative communication (AAC) systems, multi-sensory, multi-cultural universally designed 
and age-appropriate materials (e.g. single loop speech output devices, pre-programmed in Spanish/ English and gender appropriate with pictures symbols and words). Objects and materials that support second language acquisition are made available to our ELL SWD.  Opportunities for developing and increasing work skills in our in-
house work program with native language supports, and in our publication room work site are also present. These programs and materials reinforce students' acquisition and improvement of language skills.         Methodologies, such as Total Physical Response (TPR), the Language Experience Approach (LEA),  and the Natural Approach 
(NA) are employed to foster language development and to make content comprehensible to our ELL SWD.  To help students meet the demands of the grade-specific CCLS and their ELA NYSAA Essential Elements, for example, strategies such as cooperative learning and thinking maps are used to provide an opportunity for students to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

help one another understand the concepts, ideas, issues, and values in a particular text (e.g., while working on a task involving: identifying the central idea of a literary text; creating an objective summary of a literary text; recognizing an explicit or an inferred claim in an informational text; or citing a fact or an inference in an 
informational text to determine an area for further exploration). QTEL Scaffolding techniques such as modeling, bridging, schema building, contextualizing, text re-presentation, and meta cognitive development, are also used to support instruction. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Throughout the school year, teachers evaluate student's listening, speaking, reading and writing skills in their home language, using tasks at the high school level from the NYSAA ELA Essential Elements.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

   SIFE, Newcomers, Developing ELLs, Long Term ELLs, and former ELLs are provided with additional supports including AIS, Title III, CHAMPS, After School Program, and the English departmental model (authentic learning in pre-vocational activities with language supports). Students in our 6:1:1, 8:1:1, and 12:1:4 classes also participate 
in the Get Ready to Learn (GRTL) yoga program, "which provides a daily therapeutic classroom routine designed to address problems with self regulation, attention, motor planning, auditory processing and motor performance" (Anne Buckley-Reen, creator of the GRTL program). 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development?  

       
        The following are some of the strategies used in our ENL programs for ELL SWD that provide access to learning and support for ELL SWD at varying levels of language acquisition:•               Total Physical Response, •               Language Experience Approach, •               QTEL Scaffolding Techniques,  
•               Thinking Maps, 
•               Role plays,   
•               Videos, 
•               Visuals, 
•               Use of Home Language for Instruction, 
•               Small Group Activities,•               Natural Approach         The aforementioned strategies are used in conjunction with programs that provide structured learning environments for students with developmental disabilities. These programs include:•               the TEACCH method•               Get Ready to Learn•               Discrete 
Trial         Supports are given through the use of the SmartBoard or Promethean Board, internet, videos, music, and teacher-created materials. In addition, communication strategies such as Aided Language Stimulation (ALS) and the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) are also employed with our students in order to engage 
and build their receptive and expressive skills. Communication devices, as mandated by the IEP which foster students’ academic and language performance, are also used.  Teachers and supporting staff adapt materials using visuals, realia, tablets, and computer devices to ensure that ELL SWD are able to engage in listening, speaking, 
reading, and writing. Teachers use SMART and Promethean Boards, as well as software programs such as MS Powerpoint and Boardmaker to modify and adapt materials, to create multisensory, age-appropriate, and culturally diverse materials for students. In addition, our school library is headed by a certified ESOL teacher who 
teaches library and literacy skills to our ELLs; all ENL classrooms contain libraries with multi-language books and computers. Each teacher was provided with an iPad to use with students (e.g., for audio recording, filming, photographing, engaging students in motivating turn-taking activities, etc.). ELL SWD utilize technology centers that 
are equipped with computers and software that include Boardmaker and Writing with Symbols in Spanish and English. Teachers use laminators and color printers to create age-appropriate, ethnically diverse posters and supplemental materials in languages other-than-English (e.g., Spanish) and textbooks that are bilingual. Web-based 
books and related materials are used from Capstone and Attainment Company.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

All students at 721Q have disabilities, are mandated for participation in alternate assessments, and are instructed in accordance with their IEP mandates. Scheduling flexibility is employed, for example, in our semi-self-contained ENL model in which an ENL teacher in a 12:1:1 program provides 12 periods of ENL per week to group A 
during the various times of the day (e.g., periods 1 & 8 M-F and period 2 on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), and provides 12 periods of ENL per week to Group B during the remaining time (e.g., periods 5 & 7 M-F and period 2 on Tuesday and Thursday). Instructional and curricular flexibility is seen in the variety of strategies, 
approaches, materials, and deployment of support staff (paraprofessionals, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech teachers, counselors). Our four (4) certified bilingual and eleven (11) certified ESOL teachers provide our ELLs with the minimum number of minutes of ENL and HLA mandated by CR Part 154. Teachers follow 
the Attainment Company Curriculum with a pacing calendar developed by our school that addresses the CCLS, ELL SWD language acquisition needs, their IEP goals, and the Career Development Occupational Studies (CDOS) standards. The needs of our ELL SWD were taken into consideration when the curriculum was developed and 
ENL staff were a part of the curriculum committee (certified ESOL, certified bilingual). In addition, our ENL teachers meet weekly during a common prep (ENL Professional learning Network - PLN meeting) to turnkey professional development knowledge and to collaborate, consult, and plan instruction for their ELL SWD.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which they are offered. 

All students at 721Q have intellectual disabilities and are mandated for alternate assessment. Disability-related issues impact on student's language learning. There are no commercially available intervention programs in ELA and/or math for ELL students with severe cognitive disabilities (Find What Works Clearinghouse find what 
works.aspx). Behavior and communication ability is impaired by disabilities (e.g., many of our students must learn to communicate with intent and purpose. Other students who have limited verbal ability need to learn socially acceptable ways to express their needs and wants). These issues are tied to an ELL student with disabilities’ 
(SWD) ability to demonstrate skills and knowledge in ELA, HLA, mathematics, and other content areas. Therefore, at 721Q, we use a variety of approaches and interventions (e.g., social stories, teacher-created worksheets, materials from the Attainment Curriculum, and rubrics tied to the NYSAA ELA and mathematics Essential 
Elements, behavior plans based on results of the Motivation Assessment Scale, targeting prioritized skill-based language objectives and learning targets, etc.) to address the language and content-area learning needs of our ELL SWD. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming 2017-2018 school year, we plan to continue Academic Intervention Services (AIS) program for our SIFE students with intensive, rigorous instruction focused on building students' literacy skills, which are below grade level. During the 2016-2017 school year, the school implemented the instructional focus of daily peer-
to-peer communication (with rubrics including teacher and student self-assessments) in order to promote and increase in their communication, social and metacognitive skills.  We will be continuing with this instructional focus. For the 2016-2017 school year, we piloted a weekly IEP data collection system to track the progress of 
student goals and we are now (2017-2018) going to implement cycles of inquiry with emphasis on planning and preparation. During the 2016-2017 school year, we also implemented a thinking maps program to help enhance student learning across the content areas and foster cognitive thinking processes.  This upcoming school year 
2017-2018 we will expand the implementation of the thinking maps to some of the 6:1:1 and 8:1:1 classes. We will also use learning targets based on students' needs and align them the the Essential Elements.

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in your building. 

All ELLs participate in one or more of our school's programs such as: computer lab, culinary arts, music, dance, drama, adapted physical education (APE), crafts, woodshop, library, work-study program, Friday Clubs, Row New York, Summer Youth Employment, Student Talent Show, School Holiday Show, Spring Show, School Fair,  12-
month school year. Beyond the school day, our students have access to afterschool programs, such as: Project Read and CHAMPS. The Title III Program on Saturdays allows students and their families to receive additional instruction in world geography, cultures, customs, dance, and art throughout the world.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

Content-area books in Spanish and English (lined to the CCLS and to the science and social studies standards), ebooks, iPads, laptops, computer lab, videos, hands-on activities, games, web-based multilingual libraries (e.g., Capstone, Attainment), AAC devices, software programs (e.g., Lexia Reading, Boardmaker). Instruction and 
activities are implemented using interactive whiteboards, such as SMARTBoard and Promethean Board.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students participate in listening, speaking, reading, and writing activities in the home language (e.g., through skits, songs, debates, writing campaigns, etc.) Students have access to reference materials (web-based and hard copies) in the home language and in English. TBE classrooms have bilingual informational texts and bilingual 
literary texts. TBE, Freestanding, and DL program  have access to the school's bilingual library. Students access native materials and information in the native language via the computer.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The school's curriculum committee participants (which included the certified ESOL librarian, certified bilingual and ESOL teachers, and certified special education teachers), select books and other resources that are aligned to the curriculum, to the CCLS, to the HLAP, the NLAP, and to the CDOS standards. The educational resources and 
materials are age appropriate. Moreover, teachers create lesson materials and modify other instructional tools using visuals and symbols that are representative of the students’ population. In addition, this group of educators also translated books into  Spanish using innovative technology to offer students more accessibility to 
reading, writing, and listening skills. These books are selected being mindful of the concepts that students need to learn according to their grade level and they are also aligned to the CCLS to  be used with the curriculum. Computer  software and programs are used in order to adapt books by simplifying language, emphasizing new 
vocabulary, incorporating sounds, voice device to have books read, adding pictures and symbols to cultivate reading comprehension, and incorporating interactive elements for students to practice their reading skills.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

Our school is comprised of one main site and three off site locations, ENL teachers will provide instruction in all of the sites. Students have access to content-area books in Spanish and English (aligned to the CCLS and to the science and social studies standards), ebooks, iPads, laptops, computer lab, web-based multilingual libraries 
(e.g., Capstone, Attainment, Pebbles), AAC devices, software programs (e.g., Lexia Reading, Boardmaker).  
Professional Learning Network meetings among the ENL Dept, provide support across the entire school community. ENL teachers regularly receive feedback from supervisors and the ENL coach to ensure students needs are being met.  
At 721Q, our staff collaborate with the ENL General Education teachers to ensure students in our inclusion classes are fully integrated and served.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, parent coordinator).  

721Q is a District 75 school in which students attend a 12 month school year program.  New ELLs are invited to attend Chapter 683 prior to the beginning of the regular school year. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

none 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day (percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same time (simultaneous)? 

a. Twenty-two (22) students participate in our DL program which follows a side by side model. Six  students are English proficient (EP) and 16 are English language learners (ELLs). Specifically, our DL program consists of two 12:1:1 classes as follows: 1 EP student and 9 ELLs are in 
the first class, which is instructed by a certified ESOL teacher. The second class consists of an additional 5 EP students and an additional 7 ELLs. This class is instructed by a certified bilingual special education teacher.  The two teachers swap their students every day, so that each 
group of students receive a minimum of 180 minutes of instruction in English by the ESOL-certified teacher and an additional minimum of 180 minutes of instruction in Spanish by the bilingual (Spanish) special education-certified teacher. b./c. Social Studies, English language arts, 
and new language arts progressions (NLAP) are instructed in English and aligned to the CCLS. Science, mathematics, career development/occupational studies (CDOS), computers, and mathematics are instructed in Spanish.  Our EP and ELLs are instructed together 100% of the 
time, five days a week. d. Emergent literacy is taught sequentially. EP students are taught in English (literacy instruction) first and Spanish-speaking ELLs are taught (literacy) in Spanish first. 
 
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Annually, 15% of all PD at 721Q will be provided to all teachers and administrators that specifically address the needs of 
ELLs.  PD topics will include: language acquisition, best practices for integrated instruction strategies for ELL SWD, Best 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

practices in integrating language and content instruction for ELL SWD.  (ELL Policy and Reference Guide, May 2015, page 
48). 50% of the required PD hours for all bilingual and ENL teachers at 721Q will b devoted to "language acquisition in 
alignment with core content area instruction" (ELL Policy and Reference Guide, May 2015, page 48). 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All new teachers receive 10 hours of Jose P. training. In addition, teachers are awarded the opportunity to attend CTLE 
approved PD sessions provided by District 75 catalog or from NYCDOE PD Catalog.  Paraprofessionals and related service 
providers will also receive PD on issues that pertain to ELL SWD. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Goals of the particular ENL programs, progress in language development, results of language proficiency assessments, and 
language development needs are discussed during educational planning conferences (EPCs) (e.g., annual review, triennial, 
requested evaluations) and during open school meetings. Parents are also informed of these issues during special events and 
cultural celebrations.   
 
ELL records for annual individual meetings with ELL parents (e.g., attendance sheets, agendas, invitation letters, handouts, 
evaluations) are kept in the ENL binder in the ENL coordinator’s office. Outreach logs of telephone calls and logs of parents 
who required and received interpretation services are also kept in the binder. All documents that have been translated for 
parents are in the ENL binder (along with the English version).  
 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
 Every fall, 721Q holds a “Parent Welcome Orientation Event” to inform parents of our ENL programs (and of our vibrant Title 
III supplemental instructional program that begins each spring). CSE and District 75 Placement notify parents of TBE and ENL 
program options at 721Q.  For the past 2 years, we have been fortunate enough to have opened two Dual Language (Spanish) 
12:1:1 classes. This is in addition to our one 12:1:1 TBE Spanish class, and our 8:1:1 TBE Spanish class. We hold several 
meetings and events with parents to inform them of the availability of the DL classes. Parents are given a tour of our school, 
and introduced to our ENL programs (e.g., TBE, ENL-Only, bilingual related services, etc.). Most parents of ELLs who visit the 
John F. Kennedy Jr. school, 721Q, opt to have their children receive ENL services at our school. Parents also participate in our 
Saturday Title III program. The bilingual counselor and bilingual school psychologist (counselor)  with the parent coordinator, 
also provide information to parents on ENL issues during our special cultural events and PA meetings. A large percentage of 
721Q parents speak a language other-than-English, and participate  in our school meetings, and special events. 721Q offers 
interpretation using our Talk-System, a handheld communication system that allows for the interpretation of multiple 
languages simultaneously. Bilingual teachers, bilingual paraprofessionals, and bilingual related service providers interpret for 
parents during meetings (e.g., Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, Bengali, Hindi, Haitian Creole etc).

Since the NYSED rolled out the new adaptive performance-style New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) in ELA and 
mathematics, we at 721Q are using a dynamic learning maps (DLM) assessment system to assess our ELL students' learning needs. 
"The Dynamic Learning Maps™ (DLM) project offers an innovative way for all students with significant cognitive disabilities to 
demonstrate their learning throughout the school year via the DLM Alternate Assessment System (dlm@ku.edu, 2015). Instruction 
is integrated with assessment throughout the school year in this adaptive performance-style assessment that maps student 
performance in ELA and mathematics as performance in these areas relate to career development and occupational studies tasks. 
This adaptive performance-style assessment is accessible by students with significant cognitive disabilities, including those who 
also have hearing or visual disabilities, and/or neuromuscular, orthopedic, or other motor disabilities.  DLM assessments are 
flexible. They allow for the use of common assistive technologies in addition to keyboard and mouse and touch-screen technology.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Henry Renelus, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The language preferences of the parents at 721Q were identified using a variety of methods and in a variety of 
ways during interactions and contact with parents. We consulted ATS for initial identification of home languages 
other-than-English spoken by parents of students at 721Q. In addition, information on parent language needs was 
collected from parents and gleaned from the sources and methods listed below:  
• Home languages of students in school indicated in ATS 

• Home Language Surveys were reviewed (Including Part 3: Parent Information) and language needs were 
identified 

• A school-generated survey was also distributed to check accuracy of previously acquired information 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

• Evaluations completed by parents during parent meetings, parent conferences, and other parent activities.  

• Documentation of language needs from face-to-face encounters with parents  

• Language needs identified by parents during IEP conferences 

• Language needs identified by parents on pre-registration, registration (including emergency cards), and 
attendance forms  

• Language needs identified by parents to Parent Coordinator, PA, and Transition Linkage Coordinator during 
individual and group meetings 

• Language needs as determined by language of written communication to teachers and other staff received from 
parents 

• Review of translated written correspondences sent home to parents in the past  

  

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

The John F. Kennedy School Jr. School(P721Q) uses the Schoolmessenger System to reach our parents in the event of 
an emergency. In addition, we also have a Parent Email Distribution list, in which the Parent Coordinator will send an 
email to all parents who have submitted their email addresses to the school. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During staff (teacher, related service provider and paraprofessional) meetings, staff are chosen and given training and 
guidance from other staff members on translating for parents with limited English proficiency. Translation services are 
provided to parents of limited English proficiency during all school functions in which parents are invited to, such as 
parent association meetings, parent teacher conferences, IEP meetings and workshops regarding their children’s 
education. Bilingual paraprofessionals, teachers, related service providers and coordinators are also available at all 
times if a parent comes to or contacts the school unannounced and is in search of guidance from the school. If 
translations services are unavailable for a specific language, staff can also use a translation call center or translation 
services on the Internet. Staff are expected to work in compliance with the chancellor’s regulations and provide 
translations for those parents in need.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

 
• Information about the location of language specific material will be posted at the school’s main entrance. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

• A “Language Services Request” form will also be available for any parent or guest to indicate specific communication 
needs. The specific needs information will be maintained and records for future planning. 

• The Parent Coordinator (PC) will have all documents in all languages available. 

• The PC will have a list of all staff who are able to interpret and/or translate in English and any other language(s).  

  

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

P721Q will conduct a parent survey as to the quality and availability of translation and interpretation services at the 
school. The Language Access Coordinator and Parent Coordinator will be responsible for gathering and analyzing the 
feedback, as well as informing the administrators of the school as to the results of the survey.
