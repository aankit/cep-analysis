Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

BCSM’s academic rigor is complemented by our core virtues that guide our school’s culture: Respect, Integrity, Honor, 
Excellence, Commitment, Perseverance, and Service. In 2016, BCSM was recognized as the #54 Top High Schools in 
America - Beating the Odds by Newsweek, serving low income - high poverty communities . The mission is to graduate 
over 90% of our students and to make sure they are college, career and life ready. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Background 

The Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics is an unscreened school that opened in September 2005. We receive a 
“normal distribution” of applicants that mirrors the achievement profile of NYC students.  

BCSM’s average 4-year graduation rate is 90% since 2009, compared to 70% in New York City; 98% of the class of 2018 
will be attending college. The school is located in the South Bronx community of Morrisania, within the poorest 
congressional district in America. We are adjacent to a halfway house and two blocks from a Bronx House of 
Detention annex.  

BCSM Ranking and College Readiness 

On College Readiness measures (literacy and math standardized tests), BCSM was ranked top 10 of unscreened school 
in New York City; 80% of seniors are rated “college ready. In 2018, U.S. News and World Report ranked BCSM a "silver 
medal" school placing it in the top 4% of all high schools in the United States.  

 

 

Strategic Partnerships and Initiatives 

Four important partnerships for BCSM are the Charles Hayden Foundation, Heckscher Foundation fro Children, PDT 
Partners, Travelers, Inc.. and Mr. Robert Schwartz. The Hayden Foundation funds BCSM's Summer Bridge Program for 
the incoming freshmen and the rising sophomores as well as our comprehensive after-school academic and 
enrichment program. Travelers inc. funds our SAT and ACT prep classes using Kaplan SAT instructors. Mr. Robert 
Schwartz funds BCSM's STEM research and competition participation. We look forward to extending these initiatives 
next year; for example, BCSM is in the process of developing a “Bridge to College” program for our graduates.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Student Profile 

BCSM has 460 students; the incoming freshman class had over 3400 applicants for 125 seats, testimony to the 
school’s success with students across all achievement levels. In addition, 86% of our students qualify for free/reduced 
lunch, 24% of entering students have IEPs requiring special education services, and 4% of our students are English 
Language Learners. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Framework for Great Schools 

While BCSM has experienced growth in all areas of the framework, two areas in which we made the most progress 
are building collaboration between teachers and developing effective school leadership. Evidence for the first area of 
growth is seen in our ICT partnerships. We have worked to make these relationships truly collaborative rather than 
merely cooperative. We are at the point now where visiting schools are remarking that they cannot differentiate 
between the responsibilities of each teacher in the room and students are comfortably looking at both teachers as 
having ownership of the content material. Evidence for the second area is found in the number of teachers BCSM has 
helped to successfully complete leadership programs; in addition, there is a widespread distribution of leadership 
roles—assistant principals, department coordinators, grade-level leaders. Finally, teachers have been given the 
responsibility to lead professional development in ways that are most meaningful to them, e.g., the ICT classroom. 

Focus 

A key focus for next year will be to continue building the leadership capacity at BCSM. Our school community takes 
seriously its responsibility to maintain its high level of excellence while at the same time contributing to the success of 
its colleagues through professional development and modeling best practices.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
The need to address the New York State and NYC implementation of the Common Core Learning Standards . 

Although our school scored a well-developed on the Quality Review, we will continue to push all our students to meet 
the highest standards possible. Additionally, we will continue to reach a college-readiness rate of 80% or higher ( as 
reflected in the NYC School Quality Guide) with constant support from New Visions on data analysis to help our staff 
target instructional needs. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will collaborate to create 5-10 student-centered instructional units utilizing rigorous 
tasks with appropriate supports aligning curriculum and assessment to the Common Core State Standards as 
measured by the percentage of students with a 4-year graduation rate from 91% to above 92% . We will continue to 
monitor the percentage of students who pass the ELA regents exam with a 65 or above (currently at 99%) with a goal 
of 100% as well as the percentage that demonstrate college readiness of achieving a 75 on the ELA regents exam 
(currently at 79%) with a goal of above 85% college ready. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will develop individual and departmental SMART goals 
to reflect an emphasis on reading and writing aligned with the 
Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). Common Core and 
curriculum development training will be provided to staff with an 
emphasis on reading and writing at all levels, grades 9-12, and an 
emphasis on interdisciplinary work. 

Bring in consultants and support from LDF assigned by our PSO—
New Visions for Public Schools—to provide staff with data 
analysis training. 

Create a set of consistent writing standards that teachers in all 
disciplines will follow (adaptation of the ELA and SS writing rubric 
and standards) that utilize strategies from the Writing 
Revolution. Incorporate a specific strategy for including an 
extended writing assignment in each core content classroom by 
June 2018. All departments collaborate on a summer assignment 
for incoming freshmen. The ELA and SS teachers will collaborate 
on 2 units by Spring 2019 to align with the CCLS. The 
Mathematics team will collaborate on aligning all units by Spring 
2019 with the CCLS after receiving the training. The Science team 
will collaborate with the ELA, SS and Mathematics teachers to 
align units with the CCLS by June 2019. 

Create a consistent Professional Development structure for 
Monday after school PD time that repeats itself each marking 
period. Therefore, teachers will be able to revisit strategies and 
approaches discussed to increase uniformity across contents and 
grade levels. This will include department meetings where 
teachers can vertically plan and scaffold material to reach the 
needs of all students, as well as intervisitation triads that are 
horizontally organized. The intervisitation triads will be grouped 
based off grade level needs and literacy strengths to fuse both of 
those school wide initiatives.  

 

Additionally, we have a new set of instructional leaders that have 
joined our Professional Development Committee to better align 
our instructional approaches both vertically and horizontally to 
create more uniformed strategies around literacy and growth 
mindset. We will measure success through an analysis of writing

year assessment reflecting growth on a series of writing domains 
and dimensions as reflected on an established rubric developed 
by the humanities team. Through a systemic intervisitation 
model set up by our PD Committee this year, teachers will be 
visiting other classrooms and logging various ways to address 
reading and writing in their own classrooms that they learn from 
colleagues. The administration in partnership with the PD 
committee will strategically partner teachers in intervisitation 
triads in order to achieve this goal. Additionally, intervisitation 
triads will be given two Monday PD time slots a month to debrief 
and plan using their findings.  

 

 
 

 
3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Parent workshops during monthly PA meetings. AP Supervision will plan, implement and oversee monthly PD sessions 
for parents. Continue implementing Junior and Senior Parent Nights to promote college-readiness rates.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
By February 2019, APs will meet with teachers to ensure that student centered units are created to demonstrate 
progress towards the goal. APs will meet with teachers to adjust their SMART goals based off their progress with their 
Common Core aligned units. Each grade level will have completed and reviewed the success of one interdisciplinary 
unit that incorporates Common Core reading and writing standards. Ultimately, resulting in a higher pass rates on all 
our Regents. The Humanities is hoping to maintain a 99% pass rate for ELA and push all history Regents to a 92% or 
above. The Math and Science departments are putting systems in place to achieve higher pass rates in their 
respective content areas. In particular, we are hoping to maintain the 94% pass rate or above for Algebra and 
continue to give multiple opportunities for students to achieve College Readiness in Math. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.)

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The mission and goal of BCSM since inception in 2005 is to graduate 100% of our scholars in 4 years with at least a 
New York State Regents diploma. This is an on-going goal that will constantly push us to move our organization from 
“good to great.” Our main focus is to make sure that all students (inclusive of Students with Learning Disabilities and 
English Language Learners) receive a superior educational opportunity. We want to ensure that we are creating 
multiple-pathways to graduation for all our students. We will also be using data from various sources, such as the 
Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, and NYC School Survey. We want to ensure that 
we are using the feedback from these different data sources, so that we can continue to move BCSM to go from 
"good to great." Ultimately, our goal for 2018-2019 is to increase our 4-year graduation rate from 91% to above 92% 
and to continue to increase the college readiness of our graduates from 79% to 85%.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
To have a 4-year graduation rate above 92% with over 80% being college ready for the class of 2019. We will be 
having on-going meetings with the leadership team throughout the school year to ensure that our students are on 
track for graduation. These meetings will happen at least at the end of each of our six marking periods. (MP1 - 
10/2018; MP2- 12/2018; MP3- 1/2019; MP4-3/2019; MP5- 4/2019; MP6-6/2019). At these meetings, we will discuss 
student progress in each subject, identify credit gaps and plan out interventions with parents to ensure that we 
successfully bring them to the finish line and graduate on time. Lastly, we will utilize blended learning to address any 
students who do not make it to June graduation in order for them to graduate by August 2019.

2018-2019. We will measure success through an analysis of 
writing samples through diagnostics, midterm assessments and 
end of year assessment reflecting growth on a series of writing 
domains and dimensions as reflected on an established rubric 
developed by the humanities team. Additionally, we will 
incorporate the ideas from Literacy Leaders last year in both the 
Humanities and Science classrooms. Through a systemic 
intervisitation model set up by our PD Committee this year, 
teachers will be visiting other classrooms and logging various 
ways to address reading and writing in their own classrooms that 
they learn from colleagues. The administration in partnership 
with the PD committee will strategically partner teachers in 
intervisitation triads in order to achieve this goal. Additionally, 
intervisitation triads will be given two Monday PD time slots a 
month to debrief and plan using their findings.

Since September 2016, the college office was be renamed the college and career success office with the overall 
school goal that every BCSM student graduates with a plan for post-high school. BCSM will designate a master 
teacher to take on the role of creating a student ambassador program on college campuses.. By February 2019, we 
will track the progress of the roll out of this department with measurable goals determined at the start of the school 
year. Additionally, our college and career office will familiarize themselves with more alternative pathways in order to 
better serve our student population. We will continue to reach a college-readiness rate of 80% or higher ( as reflected 
in the NYC School Quality Guide) with constant support from New Visions on data analysis to help our staff target 
instructional needs. Additionally, we have enrolled in the College Access for All initiative to support our goal of every 
student graduating with a plan. We partnered with CARA to revisit our early college awareness elective offered to all 
ninth graders and to support us in a new elective for seniors as they create their plans early in the year. Lastly, our

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Historically, BCSM has always had strong parent engagement and involvement throughout the school community and 
civic life of the school. In response to the School Quality Snapshot we are hoping to improve on the 81% who 
responded positively to questions about Strong Family-Community Ties. Parents have asked for more regular 
communication from teacher regarding their child's' academic progress well in advance of the distribution of progress 
reports during the 6 marking periods throughout the year, so teachers will email/call parents regularly to 
communicate student progress especially for those at risk academically. We will encourage parents to be actively 
involved in school functions (ex. International Food festivals, thanksgiving meal, and day for children service day) 
throughout the year serving side-by-side with faculty and staff on behalf of our students.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
BCSM would like to improve on the School Quality Snapshot in the category on Strong Family-Community Ties from 80% 
responded positively to 85% exceeding the city average of 83% by 2%. We will continue to work towards increasing 
parent involvement through monthly attendance at PA meetings and other school events/meetings from 30-40 parents 
in 2017-2018 to 50-75 parents in 2018-2019.

SIFE, STH). 

SLT and PA will work closely to make parents feel more 
comfortable with attending monthly PA meetings. There will be 
translators available for those parents who do not speak English. 
Refreshments will be served at monthly meetings along with 
guest speakers to address topics of interest that come from 
parent surveys. Parents will receive regular updates via email

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

The Bronx Center for Science and Mathematics agrees to implement the following statutory requirements:

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Since all our ELLs are students receiving continuance of services, we rely on their previous exams data, e.g., NYSESLAT and 
NyStart. Based on their previous performance and proficiency levels we differentiate instruction to meet the students’ literacy 
needs. The majority is proficient in listening and speaking, but the reverse is true in reading and writing. Hence, differentiation 
focuses on reading and writing skills.            
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teacher, counselors and administration collectively support ENLs 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our goal is that students will move up one level an transition out within two to three years.  We evaluate the success of our 
ELLs based on their outcomes in the NYSESLAT, the Regents exams, credit accumulation by grade level, promotion rate to 
grade levels, graduation rate and college acceptance   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Regular conferences with AP an department coordinator who oversees ENL. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school uses data through schoolwide baseline assessments to create instructional goals for ELLs on a grade team level. 
Once these goals are set, formative assessments are implemented to ensure the success of the targeted instruction. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
As discussed above, there is an upward trajectory in the proficiency levels for majority of the students. Students do better in 
the listening/speaking than they do in reading/writing.           
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Weekly departmental meetings and monthly faculty meetings. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We offer the Free Standing ESL model. Classes are ungraded, students are grouped heterogeneous [mixed proficiency 
levels]   and instruction is delivered by the ESL teacher   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Students receive the mandated minutes of instruction according to their level of English proficiency as per CR Part 154. 
Beginning ENLs receive 3 units of study (540 minutes of ENL instruction); Intermediate ENLs receive 2 units of study (360 
minutes of ENL instruction); and Advanced students receive 1 unit of study in ESL (180 minutes of instruction) and 1 unit of 
study in ELA (180 minutes of instruction). There is one ENL teacher for 35 students. The teacher provides the minutes through 
self-contained ENL class as well as pushing in to English classes. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Instructional programs with high levels of rigor and support result in higher academic achievement for ENLs. Effective 
strategies used across all content areas include: differentiation, small group instruction, explicit academic vocabulary 
instruction, scaffolding (modeling, bridging, contextualization, schema building, metacognitive development, text 
representation). Our school focus is on reading and writing across all content areas. Studies show that native language 
development accelerates literacy gains in both the native language and English. As such, we offer language development and 
support for content instruction with native language support. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   In order to ensure that ENLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages throughout the year exams, quizzes, and 
performance tasks are discretionary translated. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  
a. For SIFE students intensive academic intervention is implemented on a case by case basis, depending on the length of 
interrupted education. Teachers aid students not only to develop a second language but also to form habits necessary for 
success in an academic environment.  
b. For newcomers, we simplify language, amplify content, provide hands-on demonstrations, opportunities for role play, 
journal writing using native language or pictures. Intensive instruction prepares ENLs for ELA testing. Newcomers also are 
provided with after school tutorials in ELA, Social Studies, Science, and Math. 
c. Students who have been receiving service for 4-6 years are typically close to testing out of ENL. For this reason, special 
attention needs to be focused on the specific aspects of language that are preventing students from becoming mainstreamed. 
With this targeted intervention students will increase the likelihood of accelerated mainstreaming.  
d. For long-term ENLs, it is important to examine students' academic progress on an individual basis to examine what is 
preventing students from achieving proficiency. Long term ENLs may need additional tutorials outside of the normal school 
day to receive the extra support needed.  
e. Former ENLs academic progress will be closely monitored to ensure their adjustment to mainstream classroom. In extreme 
situations, ENL services can be provided if students struggle to adjust. In addition, former ENLs are entitled to time extensions 
on state exams. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
As previously stated, grade-level teachers strategically planned for the academic language connected with the content in order 
to improve ENL language development and literacy across the content areas. In addition, teachers use differentiated 
instruction to address students with varying learning styles. Teachers also design content objectives with multiple pathways 
available for students to demonstrate their knowledge of content area information. The materials that we use are 
predominantly teacher modified versions of readings, as well as teacher-made writing scaffolds and graphic organizers that 
relate to the content and grade level material. For beginner ENLs, students have access to Google translate in order to 
translate readings a class assignments. All ENL students also have access to Rosetta Stone in English for additional practice.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

Each special education instructor is assigned a content area. Within that department, the special education instructor works 
collaboratively with content teachers to achieve IEP goals in the designated environment. The ELL coordinator also works 
collaboratively with departments design instructional objectives that will lead to improved English proficiency for students. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELA – provide supports for reading comprehension and program for an ICT class to have extra teacher support 
Math - provide supports for reading comprehension and program for an ICT class to have extra teacher support 
Science -  provide supports for reading comprehension and program for an ICT class to have extra teacher support 
Social Studies - provide supports for reading comprehension and program for an ICT class to have extra teacher support 
  
None of the classes are taught in the native language; all classes provide extended time on exams; ESL teacher reinforces all 
content material in ENL class; content teachers meet with ESL teacher to discuss assessment data 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Subject to funding availability, we will restore our Saturday Academies in all content areas. These academies prepare students 
for the State exams. We also will restore our after school electives in athletics and the arts which were discontinued this year 
due to budget cuts.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Our ENLs will continue to receive their mandated instructional services. For the current school year, we have discontinued due 
to budget cuts the after school arts and athletics electives as well as the Saturday Academies. The discontinuance is for all 
students, ENLs and non ENLs. However, six weeks prior to the state exams, we will hold a series of after school test prep 
sessions.            
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ENLs are afforded equal access to all school programs during and after the regular school day. ENLs are encouraged to attend 
tutoring, enrichment, athletic and general school activities. Notification flyers and letters are distributed in English and in 
students’ native language. Communications with ENLs are offered in English and in students’ native language, as appropriate 
           
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All our students are provided with textbooks in all content areas. In 9th and 10th grade Math, for example, we use the Core 
Curriculum textbooks/materials/classroom libraries. In ELA, we use the College Board’s SpringBoard curriculum and its 
attendant textbooks. In ENL we provide textbooks for every ENL level and subgroup. All our classrooms are equipped with 
computers and every teacher is provided in an LCD projector. In addition, we have a class set of laptop computers that can be 
transported from class to class. Six of our classrooms are equipped Smart Boards. Hence, ENLs have access to or are provided 
with the technology resources of the school.            
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ll our high school students, ENL and non-ENL are programmed to foreign language courses, either Spanish or French. The 
French speaking students are in a French class. The rest are in Spanish courses. We have Spanish 1, 2, and 3 as well as an AP 
Spanish Language courses. Spanish courses terminate in a Regents exam or an AP exam.            
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All ENLs are programmed to appropriate ENL courses based on their Lab-R/NYSESLAT scores. Their Spanish and/or French 
courses are based on their levels of proficiency.   All instruction is Common Core aligned according to their grade band.       
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
All our students are provided with textbooks in all content areas. In 9th and 10th grade Math, for example, we use the Core 
Curriculum textbooks/materials/classroom libraries. In ELA, we use the College Board’s SpringBoard curriculum and its 
attendant textbooks. In ENL we provide textbooks for every ENL level and subgroup. All our classrooms are equipped with 
computers and every teacher is provided in an LCD projector. In addition, we have a class set of laptop computers that can be 
transported from class to class. Six of our classrooms are equipped Smart Boards. Hence, ENLs have access to or are provided 
with the technology resources of the school.            
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All our new students and their families, ENLs and non-ENLs, receive intensive orientation sessions prior to each school 
opening. The orientations focus on the school’s mission, vision, core values, instructional programs, school culture, 
expectations, disciplinary codes/discipline, an d the like.            
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We only offer Spanish. However, this is not considered an elective at our school. Foreign languages are part of our 
curriculum           
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development is ongoing for all personnel who work with ENLs to include APs, subject area teachers, secretaries, 
the parent coordinator. The ENL teacher and content area teachers attend training offered through the NYCDOE, BETAC, QTEL 
Institutes. The ENL teacher facilitates monthly PDs on ENL strategies, testing accommodations, ENL identification protocols, 
stages of second language acquisition, analyzing ENL data, as well as participates in various school’s inquiry teams to support 
content area teachers’ instruction of ENLs and students’ progress. Documentation of ELL training for all staff is maintained in 
the school file by the Principal's Secretary. 
Professional development is available for ELL teachers through office of ENLs. Additionally, money has been set aside from 
Title III to provide for additional professional development.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Assistance is provided by the Instructional Managers of our CFN network, particularly, on compliance issues and instructional 
resources. 
Describe the minimum 7.5 hours of ELL training for all staff, other than those who hold ENL and bilingual licenses, as per CR P. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

 

This is one area that we have to work on this year. We have made arrangements with our CFN network’s instructional team to 
provide the training. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition to the PTA and the SLT, parents participate actively in school events, both those initiated by the school such as 
Parent Book Clubs (a monthly book discussion group), Open School Days in which parents visit their child in the classroom, Pot 
Luck Dinners (in which parents bring food to share); school assemblies (in which parents help with decorations, food, and 
decorum during dances, Thanksgiving/Christmas Lunch, Valentine’s Dance, Theater Arts presentations, or act as school trip 
chaperones, etc.) and those that parents initiate such as school wide photo shoots, fund raising events, etc. Parents are given 
orientation on the school’s mission and vision, its curriculum, State standards and assessment (middle school testing, NYESLAT, 
Regents), the school’s partnership with the College Board and the attendant curricular, instructional, and assessment 
implementations entailed. Parents also are met individually or in small groups by our Attendance Team to help them with 
strategies to improve their child’s attendance and deter tardiness. Part of our school culture involves constant communication 
and meeting with parents, such as the monthly progress reports that they receive from each course, the monthly attendance 
reports and newsletter that all families receive, and the constant email exchanges between parents and teachers. All teachers 
have a contractual subscription with Schedula, an online system that enables teachers to input each student’s essential data 
(attendance, exams, quizzes, projects, homework, class standing, etc.). Parents are provided hard copies of progress reports at 
the beginning of each month. Parents and students also are provided with user IDs and passwords so that they could access 
the reports online at any time 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

In addition to the PTA and the SLT, parents participate actively in school events, both those initiated by the school such as 
Parent Book Clubs (a monthly book discussion group), Open School Days in which parents visit their child in the classroom, Pot 
Luck Dinners (in which parents bring food to share); school assemblies (in which parents help with decorations, food, and

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Edward Tom, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
