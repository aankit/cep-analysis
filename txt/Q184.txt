Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S. 184 is a dedicated community of life-long learners. Students, staff and families work and support one another in 
accomplishing the rigorous challenge of preparing all students for college and career. By connecting curriculum and 
standards to authentic, real life experiences and circumstances, we engage, nurture and challenge students, while 
simultaneously highlighting individual strengths and talents. Our students will make a variety of positive contributions 
to the modern world around them. They will ultimately become Learners for life, for Life! 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 184Q, the Flushing Manor School, is located in Whitestone, Queens. This Pre-K-5 elementary school serves a 
population of approximately 520 students from culturally diverse backgrounds. The school serves as an integral part 
of community life for the students and their families. The school has a warm and welcoming atmosphere for 
student’s, family members and staff and it prides itself on its unique family like environment. Pride in the students' 
accomplishments is evident in the prominently displayed student work throughout the building and through a variety 
of school-wide celebrations that are ongoing throughout the school year. The student body consists of 46.1% white 
students, 37.4 % Asian students, 14.6 % Hispanic students and 1.3% multiracial. Approximately 13.4% of the students 
are Special Education with Individualized Education Plans (IEPs). All students with IEPs receive the full continuum of 
services as needed, with a Self-Contained small class in the lower grades, Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) across all 
grades, and a combination push in/pull out Special Education Teacher Support program as needed across grades 
(SETSS program). There is also a continuum of related services such as speech and language, occupational and/or 
physical therapy and counseling provided as needed. English Language Learners make up 8.3% of the total student 
population, they receive mandated services according to the most recent requirements of Language Allocation Policy. 
One full time ENL staff member is supported by 2 additional staff members holding both the common branch and ENL 
certifications. Only 34.2% of our students qualify for free lunch. 

 

Despite a small budget, due to limited school size and non-title I status, P.S. 184 prioritizes enrichment and the arts. 
We continue to have a full time visual arts teacher who serves all K-5 classes. Our students are provided with dance 
instruction across all grades. Dancing Classrooms works with our grade 5 students and City Center works with our 
grade K-4 students. Both programs foster a sense of respect and pride and improve self-esteem for our students. 
Students learn how to treat each other as equals, learn respect, and take great pride in their performances 
throughout the year. Our students also participate in a choral music cluster program as well as theater opportunities 
and music appreciation through classroom exposure. We strongly believe in providing opportunities for all of our 
students to shine. Interest based centers are set up in early grade classrooms and a cycle of Renzulli based 
enrichment clusters for grade 4 and 5 students occurs every Spring. Our Parent Teacher Association (PTA) contributes 
to approximately 2/3 of our Arts Residency budget and 100% of our enrichment cluster budget to enhance the quality 
and duration of these programs. The PTA also provides a variety of funding for classroom and school needs including 
supplies and technology. Support from the community has also come from grants from the City Council and Flushing 
Town Hall, a cultural arts center in our area. Local politicians support our school by consistently providing funds to 
support technology and after school programs as well as capital projects such as an auditorium upgrade and more 
recently a security camera system. We also continue to implement the PE works initiative providing students with the 
mandated physical education instruction provided by a licensed physical education teacher and Move to Improve 
programming for all staff. 

 

Based on parent, teacher and student feedback, the thing that stands out most about our school is that we are a 
unique community of learners. All stakeholders communicate constantly and are responsive to one another, always 
acting in the best interest of the children, even when it means going above and beyond. We work together in order to 
make sure that each person, whether child or adult, is reaching his or her maximum potential and feels comfortable 
enough to take risks that result in new learning. As our motto states we are truly “Learners: for Life, for Life!” 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

17% of our population are students with disabilities (SWD) and 9% of our students are ENL students. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Our most recent Grade 3-5 data for our subgroups is as follows: 

  Our ENL subgroup contains only 9 students in ELA and 11 students in math. Specifically, in math 63.64% of 

ENL students performed at levels 3 and 4, a 26.14 % increase. In ELA however, only 11% performed at level 3 
and 4. We continue to put in supports to address the needs of this unique population of learners as measured 
by NYS standards. 

  Our SWD subgroup contains 44 students in math and 43 in ELA. In ELA, only 20% performed at level 3 and 4 
combined but in math 36.91% performed at level 3 and 4 combined . Though performance was not as strong 
as the general education students however progress was higher for this group, 100% of students made 
growth. 

  Our Hispanic subgroup contains 26 students in ELA and 24 in math. 50% of the students performed at level 3 

and 4 combined in ELA and 50% of the students performed at level 3 and 4 combined in Math. 

o  Progress for these subgroups of students continues to be measured by a variety of indicators 

including state exam results, F&P levels, Go Math Assessments and movement toward meeting IEP 
goals. Providing a holistic approach to balance academic and social emotional support is critical for 
these students. School initiatives such as school wide enrichment and authentic learning allow for 
individual strengths to be identified and highlighted, resulting in opportunities outside academics. 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

  According to the Framework for Great Schools report released in June of 2018, we have scored 4.34 or higher 

out of 4.99 points in all six areas including Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environment, Teacher 
Collaboration, Family and Community Ties, Effective Leadership and Trust. With 93% parents and 100% of 
teachers responding, our school survey responses from parents and teachers are very positive. We proudly 
continue to set goals in all of the Framework Areas despite our remarkable performance. We know that 
excellence is sustainable only when consistency and hard work are applied. 

  Our Quality Review data (March 2015) indicated our school was Well-Developed in four out of five indicators 

including Curriculum, Assessment, High Expectations, and Teacher Teams. Curriculum was our area of 
celebration. Only Teacher Pedagogy was rated as proficient and was deemed as an area of focus. This year we 
continue to focus on improving pedagogy through the focused use of summative and formative assessment 
data in literacy to further drive instruction. 

  We are a school in good standing. NYS ELA and Math data indicate growth as well as strong performance. 

Specifically, in ELA, 65.7% of students are at levels 3 and 4 and in math, 78.8% are at level 3 and 4. Gains were 
.6% in ELA and 6.1% in math. 

  Advance data shows 1/3 of our teachers are highly effective in their classroom teaching practices (MOTP) and 

all teachers are either effective or highly effective overall. We continue to grow as a school community by 
engaging in the Learning Partner Program this year we have been selected to be a host school working in a 
quadrant with three other district schools. Our model teachers provide support and professional learning 
opportunities for our teachers as well as for those in our partner schools. 

 

 

Our instructional focus this year involves designing and planning engaging mathematics lessons to support all learners 
in being successful in open ended real world problems that will serve to prepare students for success on the Algebra 
regents. Using a child centered inquiry based approach , teachers will address the needs of students at various levels 
and seek to improve performance in math problem solving for all students. To that end, we will be examining closely 
the progress students are making during daily math instruction as well as over time. Lessons will include embedded 
opportunities for self and peer assessment and close teacher monitoring. We will also continue to implement the 
research based methods of Grant Wiggins in the field of transfer of learning as they apply to mathematical problem 
solving..

While embarking on this focus, we will continue to celebrate students’ high quality work and individual strengths 
through curriculum celebrations, and Student Recognition Assemblies. We will also continue the successful 
implementation of the Renzulli Enrichment model by engaging our grade 4 and 5 students in spring enrichment 
cluster cycles.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
To increase parent involvement and engagement, parent workshops will be offered across all grade levels and subject

students and provides resources that highlight diverse cultures 
and perspectives around the world. 

-Renzulli School wide Enrichment Clusters 

teachers and children in the upper grades will select and 
participate in interest-based clusters allowing them to discover 
talents outside of academic areas. Students will work in 
collaboration with students of same interests ensuring mixed 
ethnicities discovering commonalities. We will extend these 
enrichment opportunities to the lower grades by incorporating 
the Independent Investigation Method (IIM) and interest based 
centers whereby students are also grouped by interests.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

PPO Feedback 

Refine assessment strategies to support all learners by thoughtfully including a variety of assessment approaches into 
everyday lessons that address a combination of skills and abilities. 

 

These results indicate strength in teacher teams and teacher relationships with one another and school leadership. A 
focus area is to elevate student progress across all areas by improving formative assessment strategies while 
simultaneously sustaining and enhancing the collaborative process. A distinction would be to move the staff to a 
collaboration approach that moves from "outside the classroom" in the form of planning and sharing of ideas to an 
"inside the classroom" collaboration including feedback and support from peers rather than from administrators.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. [P.S. 184Q] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of theEvery 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[P.S. 184Q] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

[P.S. 184Q] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (, is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning Newcomer ELL students, grades K-3, will participate in an intensive 
Literacy program on Saturdays, from 9:00 - 11:30 a.m.  The Saturday program will be held 12/1, 12/8, 12/15, 
`1/5, 1/12, 1/26, 2/2, 2/9, 3/2, 3/9, 3/16, 3/23, 3/30, 4/6, 4/13 for a total of 15 sessions.  Saturdays during 
school holidays will be omitted from the schedule.  This Literacy program is above and beyond the mandated 
core program.  This program will be conducted in English.  It will be open to all entering, emerging and 
transitioning ELL students from grades K-2.   Program will be made available to 25 students. Students will be 
invited to the program via translated letters in the family's preferred language listing the pertinent information 
regarding the program along with a tear off sheet giving consent. These consent slips will be kept in a Title 
III file in the principal's office. Research shows that balanced literacy enhances learning for new language 
learners.  Students often do not have the chance to acquire reading strategies because they are consumed with 
the difficult process of learning English. This results in difficulty in reading comprehension and 
decoding.  Research also shows that children who live in homes where English is not spoken need additional 
assistance to catch up to grade level expectations in classroom curriculum areas. One ENL teacher along with 
one content specialty teacher will each teach a group of students in grades K-2 to improve literacy skills, 
develop language acquisition and curriculum skills. Teachers will use a team-teaching model and include 
flexible grouping by grade level or proficiency level when appropriate.   The rationale of this program is to 
firstly, create a welcoming and comforting environment for our lower grade beginner and transitioning 
ELLs so they feel just as comfortable and confident in their classrooms during the week.  It is the program's 
goal also to reinforce skills and strategies taught in the classroom during the weekdays through enriching 
activities and support students in all modalities by exposing them to authentic English and multicultural 
experiences that they may not have at home. Areas of literacy to be focused on include: Read aloud with 
discussion, phonemic awareness, phonics (decoding as well as spelling), vocabulary development, fluency, 
comprehension, as well as, oral and written expression.  Strong emphasis will be placed on vocabulary 
development and oral and written expression.  This supplemental program along with supplemental 
materials will base instruction on Fountas and Pinnell Assessment, NYSITELL and NYSELSAT data, and 
information from the classroom teacher.  In addition, engaging, high interest trade books, as well as, teacher 
adapted ReadyGen material will be used in instruction.  Paper and technology based materials from Reading 
A to Z will be used to supplement instruction.  In addition Imagine Learning will be used as a one-on-one 
RTI program. The data from Imagine Learning will also be used to help identify areas of need.   The ELL 
teachers will work on modifying the instruction to meet ELL students at their entry points through the use of 
visuals, realia, Total Physical Response (TPR), supporting acquisition of social language (BICS) and 
academic lanuage (CALPS) and other ELL strategies. Teachers will record attendance weekly and records 
will be kept in the Title III folder in the principal's office.  
Assessment will include ongoing informal teacher assessment, exit slips, and frequent monitoring of student 
work. Portfolios will be kept for each student and the supervisor will evaluate the program on an ongoing 
basis which will include writing samples graded using a general writing rubric for each grade. In addition, 
students will be assessed in their speaking and listening using rubrics and checklists aligned to the new 
language arts progression and NYSESLAT targets of measurement. Final evaluation of the program will be 
based on Fountas and Pinnell, NYSESLAT, and standardized assessments at the end of the school year.  We 
anticipate that the children participating in this program will make a gain of at least one level on the 
NYSESLAT due to their participation in the Saturday program.  Materials for the Title III Saturday Program 
will include children's literature, workbooks related to Speaking, Listening, Reading, and Writing activities, 
Imagine Learning Program for one on one and small group instruction, as well as, teacher created materials 
and projects. In addition, students will be provided with home language support via a teacher created toolkit 
containing tools such as a picture dictionary, translated key words in core subjects as well as NYS Education 
Department bilingual glossaries. These supplemental materials will serve to further enhance daily instruction.

  A variety of Professional Learning (PL) activities will be planned.  Two full day sessions of 
PL will be planned for all Common Branch teachers and ELL teachers.  A portion of 
professional learning will take place in the form of collaborative workshops, with time set aside 
for classroom teachers to meet with Title III service providers, the regular ELL teacher, and the 
assistant principal.  Tentative dates for these PL sessions are January 14th and March 
18th.  During these sessions, staff will examine data and student work and collaborate in content 
area planning and identifying appropriate instructional next steps for individual ELL students. 
These sessions will help teachers to better understand how to support their ELL students and 
how to support their growth. Strategies and assessments reflecting the criteria for success on the 
NYSESLAT will then be identified and created along with the classroom teacher.  Other 
Professional Learning will be provided by the Field Support Center, Learning Partners Model 
Teachers and our own ENL Instructional Mentor.  This will include close examination of NLAP, 
CSS, the NYS Next Generation Standards and aligned tasks and rubrics along with examination 
of student work during the Monday PL sessions. Tentative dates for these PD sessions are 12/17, 
3/11, 5/20. This will drive additions and changes to curriculum maps which will include 
differentiated instruction for ELL students which will further enhance their learning and progress 
in language acquisition.  This will provide additional professional learning in supporting ELLs in 
meeting the demands of the CSS and Next Generation Standards.  The Title III ENL teachers 
will also participate in Professional Learning sessions around Thinking Maps for ELLs in order 
to better help the students in the Saturday program express their ideas and organize their 
thoughts to prepare for oral and written expression. Tentative dates for these PD sessions are 
2/25 and 4/8.  Attendance sheets and agendas for all Professional learning sessions will be kept 
in the Professional Learning binder in the principal's office.  The ENL  certificed teacher, Sara 
Tepper, will collaborate with administration and lead PL for the staff. Thinking map professional 
learning sessions will be provided by Assistant Principal Grace Lee-Sim who is a certified 
Thinking Map trainer as well as ENL certified.   Professional learning opportunities provided by 
Mary Cuchiarra, as well as the BFSC will be utilized by Title III teachers.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
P.S. 184Q uses the NYSITELL, assessments related to Fundations word study program, Fountas and Pinnell leveling system, 
ReadyGen performance tasks, NYC performance tasks, iReady assessments and teacher created authentic literacy tasks to 
guide instructional planning. This data provides insights on the following:  students’ ability to recognize letters, phonemic 
awareness, decoding skills, fluency and reading comprehension and early writing skills.  Additionally, speaking, listening, and 
writing checklists and rubrics are introduced to students and used throughout the grades. The results determine student’s 
reading levels and specific strengths and weaknesses in literacy. This data is used for grouping for instruction. The teacher is 
also able to determine the type of reading/writing instruction that will best meet the needs of the students. For example, 
Fountas and Pinnell reading level data is used to help teachers group their students into homogeneous book clubs, which aide 
in the development of reading comprehension and discussion skills. These assessment tools also help the teacher determine 
the students who need additional language support through use of the Imagine Learning computer program. The data from 
this program gives insight into specific English skills that teachers need to focus on in small groups with our English language 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

learners.  Our school-wide data indicates that our ELL students do not perform on grade level in English Language Arts, 
specifically in reading and writing. Our instructional program includes remediation in foundational skills with an emphasis on 
Wilson Fundations and guided reading practices. We emphasize vocabulary and shades of meaning in academic language with 
our “Words for Life” program. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to support our ELLs in reading and writing, we have implemented a Student Assessment Handbook in grade 3-5.  This 
handbook contains all the checklists, rubrics, and key phrases to aide students during the writing process, support reading 
comprehension strategies, and help with understanding math word problems.  Students use the assessment handbook to self-
assess and peer-assess, as well as give feedback.  The Kindergarten ELLs have an ENL Tool Kit, that also contains checklists for 
reading, writing and speaking with picture support.  It also has Fundations letter sounds, sentence starters, and discussion 
prompts.  Similarly, students in Kindergarten use these tool kits to self-assess and peer-assess.  These tool kits will be 
expanded to grades 1 and 2 in the 2017-2018 school year.  Entering through transitioning ELLs using Imagine Learning to 
improve their foundational English reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills.  As students go through this program, data is 
collected about the students progress.  Teachers can view these reports and use recommended intervention tools and reteach 
lessons to guide instruction in the classroom, as well as Stand Alone ENL instruction. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Data is examined and compared to previous years performance on measures such as NYSESLAT, and when applicable NYS ELA 
exam. Beginning and end of year Fountas and Pinnell reading levels are also reviewed for growth patterns, as well as results 
from the NYC performance tasks.  The number of ELLs does not constitute a subgroup for AYP in ELA, Math or science as the 
number of students enrolled and participating in testing grades is below 15. Data from the EDAT and the NYSESLAT reports is 
used to identify strengths and areas of need with respect to the four modalities (Reading, Writing, Listening and 
Speaking).  Based on this data our ELLs need continued support in reading and oral comprehension. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Based on the summative data in ELA, such as from the NYS ELA exam, Fountas and Pinnell reading levels, and NYC 
performance tasks, students in grades 2-5 are placed into grade-specific homogeneous reading clubs.  Based on the data of the 
students in the group, the purpose and focus of each reading club varies.  For groups needing intervention, structures such as 
guided reading, phonics, or the Wilson fundations program may be implemented instead of traditional book club 
structures.  In addition, this data informs small group formation and instruction, as well as the level of individual usage of the 
Imagine Learning, RazKids, and iReady computer programs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 184 classes are organized by  grouping ELL students according to proficiency levels and placing commanding students into 
classrooms with dual licensed teachers when possible. This strategic placement allows for a more efficient way to meet the 
needs of individual students using a push in/pull out model. Additionally, teachers of ELL students receive training and usually 
continue working with those students over several school years. This allows for continuity of instruction and ongoing 
professional growth. Small group instruction for the ELL students is provided by both the ENL teacher and the classroom 
teacher. Ongoing formative assessments used as part of the Ready Gen and GO Math curricula along with teacher created 
assessments are administered and data from these assessments is used to form Tier 2 and or Tier 3 groups as needed. 
Classrooms on each grade with the ELL populations are prioritized for hardware and software to support the use of Imagine 
Learning as a tier 3 intervention when needed.  In addition, grades 2-5 have access to iReady that assesses student 
performance in ELA and provides individualized computer based instruction. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The NYSESLAT and ELA are used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs, with more of a focus on the NYSESLAT.  Data from 
the EDAT is very valuable in determining the success of our ELL programs. Based on the number of students in grades K-5 who 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

scored commanding on the NYSESLAT and those who made progress in proficiency levels, we can determine where 
improvements or changes need to be made in curricula and resources. This data also informs class placement in the beginning 
of the school year and placement in our Title III program.   Data identifying strengths and weaknesses in all four modalities, as 
well as how far away students were from attaining commanding in each, helps place ELLs in flexible small groups. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL Instructional Lead analyzes and shares important information from the ELL Data Analysis Tool with all teachers who 
work with ELLs.  Based on this data, teachers of ELLs work with the ENL teacher to make adjustments to their lessons and 
student groupings, as well as supports and scaffolds in grade-wide units. Teachers of ELLs are also given their ELA and 
NYSESLAT scores and modality breakdown in the beginning of the school year in order to make adjustments. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

P.S. 184Q follows a push-in/pullout model of Freestanding ENL.  In each grade students are placed in classes according 
to proficiency levels and service needs. The ENL teacher, who is dually licensed in TESOL and Common Branch pushes 
into classes in grades K-5 to deliver integrated ENL services.  We have a dual licensed teacher on grades 3 and 5 to 
service the commanding FELLs who still need to 2 periods of integrated ENL per week. A Per Diem ENL teacher 
services the FELLs in grades 1-2.  Entering, emerging and transitioning students are also pulled out in groups 
containing no more than two contiguous grades to receive standalone ENL services by the ENL 
teacher.  Heterogeneous grouping of proficiency levels is used during push-in integrated ENL in order to have built in 
peer native language support and models of appropriate English language usage for entering and emerging students.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

n/a  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Groups of students and individual classes are scheduled to ensure that they receive the mandated number of instruction 
minutes.  Entering and emerging students receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL services and 180 minutes of integrated ENL 
services both provided by the ENL teacher.  Transitioning students are scheduled for 90 minutes of standalone ENL services 
and 90 minutes of integrated ENL services, or 180 minutes of integrated ENL depending on student needs.  Expanding students 
receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL services, while commanding students are scheduled for only 90 minutes of integrated 
ENL services.  Where applicable dual licensed teachers in the classroom provide the integrated ENL services for the ELLs/FELLs 
in their class.  Students who receive integrated ENL are serviced by the ENL teacher during part of their ELA block.  Students 
who receive stand alone ENL services are pulled out to work on areas of need such as vocabulary development, 
conversation/discussion, phonics and decoding, as well as reading comprehension. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   In the freestanding ENL/ESL model, content area instruction is provided by classroom teacher, ELL teacher and teacher 
specialists in English. P.S. 184Q uses many resources and strategies to support ELL students with the ReadyGen and GOMath! 
curricula.  When necessary, the ELL teacher modifies the reading material or task in order to make it more accessible to ELLs by 
using picture support, translated text, videos, and audiobooks.  In addition, vocabulary development through preteaching 
unfamiliar words and creating text-based BICS/CALP word charts, as well as the use of thinking maps will help the ELL students 
with reading comprehension, literary response and writing development.  P.S. 184’s “Words for Life” program also prepares 
ELLs for academic vocabulary they will see in real life.  ELL students also participate in book clubs/guided reading groups in 
order to practice decoding, develop comprehension, and foster discussion skills.  In order to support the ELL students during 
GOMath!, the ELL teacher uses visual aids, such as manipulatives, pictures, and charts to help with comprehension.  Graphic 
organizers are used to help ELL students work through the problems.  In addition students have vocabulary cards for key math 
terms readily available to use while they are doing their work. Students also use computers and iPads to go on ThinkCentral to 
review and practice math concepts. In Science and Social studies, the ELL teacher provides supplemental materials 
emphasizing a visual and kinesthetic approach. Trade books, websites and videos are used to support units of study based on 
the NYC Scope and Sequence in Science and Social Studies.  Students in grades 3-5 are given bilingual glossaries In ELA, Math, 
Science, and Social Studies to use during instruction, group work and independent working time. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries are offered to students as appropriate in content area as well as during literacy and math 
assessments.  When available, tests such as the NYC performance task are administered in the home language.    Newly 
identified ELLs with Spanish as their home language are given the Spanish Lab.       
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. P.S. 184Q does not have Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) Alternate placement students or long term ELLS 
in school year 2017-2018. If SIFE students should enroll, classroom teachers would be made aware of their status and provide 
intensive small group instruction. We would provide additional support through staff members such as the guidance counselor 
and social worker. Both will provide at risk counseling and make outreach to family members. We would also provide peer to 
peer support by providing a student  buddy who can help in building social relationships with students in the same class or on 
the same grade. Outside resources will also be identified by the parent coordinator who will make outreach to families as 
well.  
b. Instruction is delivered by a combination push-in/pullout model for Newcomers.  Newcomer students with proficiency levels 
of Entering and Emerging receive 180 minutes of standalone ENL/ESL instruction and 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ESL 
instruction. Newcomer students with proficiency levels of Transitioning or Expanding receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL 
instruction.  Depending on their needs Transitioning newcomers may receive 90 minutes of standalone ENL instruction and 90 
minutes of integrated ENL instruction. The ENL teacher works with classroom teacher to identify and develop activities that 
support their learning. Small group instruction is supported by one on one access to Imagine Learning Program. Classroom 
teachers differentiate for these students in all content areas. Word walls include pictures to support language development. 
Use of speaking and writing prompts and graphic organizers/thinking maps support students in all modalities.  These students 
are also invited to participate in our Saturday Title III program.  
c. Instruction is delivered in a push-in model for Developing ELLs. All of our Developing ELLs fall in the Expanding level so they 
receive 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ESL services.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher to differentiate 
ELA instruction. When appropriate the ENL teacher delivers instruction in a parallel teaching model or takes a small group to 
focus on a specific skill or strategy.  Word walls, including shades of meaning cards and BICS/CALP word charts support 
language development.  Use of thinking maps and differentiated performance tasks support student growth.  These students

are invited to our Title III Saturday Program. 
d. P.S. 184Q does not have long-term ELLs enrolled during the 2017-2018 school year. In the event that the school had long-
term ELLs, the children would be assessed by the ELL specialist and classroom teacher. Subsequently,  a teacher request is 
forwarded to the School Assessment Team (SAT) and the School Intervention Team (SIT). Informal and formal bilingual 
evaluations are conducted by SAT and SIT pedagogues. Based on these evaluations, if special services are recommended, the 
appropriate support for the child is offered to the parents.   Students receive additional small group instruction for literacy and 
math during school hours and are invited to our Title III Saturday Program.  
e.Children who score commanding and are considered FELLs receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL transitional services for two 
years. They also continue to have testing accommodations for these two years. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teacher of ELL-SWDs provide a least restrictive environment by implementing a combination of parallel teaching, station 
teaching and small group guided instruction.  All teachers use thinking maps to differentiate content area instruction. The 
school has an extensive ENL lending library, books and books on CD for in class listening centers and at home use.   Computers 
in classroom are used; ELL teacher has provided a list of appropriate websites for ELL-SWD students targeting literacy and 
content area knowledge and skills. ELL-SWD students are enrolled in the Imagine Learning computer program, as well as 
iReady.  Both programs meet the student at his/her level and work to accelerate English language development and academic 
achievement.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs also use checklists and other resources in the Student Assessment Handbook to keep 
students on track while they are writing.  ELL-SWDs are also given additional Fundations or Wilson instruction if needed to help 
with letter sounds and recognition, phonics and decoding. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Collaboration between the ENL/ESL, general education, and special education teachers along with other service providers 
allows for connection of content and language development to IEP goals and common core standards. ELL-SWDs are placed in 
the ICT classes, put in SETSS groups, or given other support services according to the mandated services on their IEP. ELL-SWDs 
who are programmed to ICT classes have the benefit of being in a classroom with at least 60% of students being non-
disabled.  ALL ELL-SWD regardless of classroom placement are integrated and participate in all aspects of school life including 
the arts, technology, recess, and extra curricular activities. Depending on proficiency level, Entering, emerging and sometimes 
transitioning ELL-SWDs are also pulled out for standalone ENL services by our dually certified ESOL/CB ENL teacher. In addition, 
Entering through Expanding ELL-SWDs are put into small groups in the classroom with their non-disabled ELL peers to receive 
mandated integrated ENL services by our dually certified ESOL/CB ENL teacher (push in). 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The ELL teacher, along with the classroom teacher identify ELL students who are in need of intervention through the use of 
data from classroom assessments, iReady and Imagine Learning reports, state assessments, and NYSESLAT results.   Mostly 
developing ELLS who have yet to pass the NYSESLAT require additional support and are put into Rti groups. The classroom 
teacher and ELL teacher work closely together to modify and design lessons, and come up with support material for the 
students to ensure that they can meet the rigorous standards.  In addition, during the school day, P.S. 184Q, has a Star period 
built in that allows teachers to work with small groups of students, targeting their specific needs through a program called 
Book Clubs where students will receive guided reading instruction. The target group for this program was advanced ELL second 
graders with low reading levels.  In addition, all ELL students are also offered extra ELL instruction through the Saturday Title III 
program.  All of these intervention programs are conducted in English.  The school has also adopted the Thinking Maps 
program which allows teachers to further differentiate tasks and allow  all ELL students to make their thinking visible and more 
organized through the use of the maps. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

New programs such as reading clubs will be implemented to further develop  reading comprehension and discussion 
skills.  There will also be an AIS component incorporated into these reading clubs.  New computer programs such as iReady and 
RazKids have been introduced in the classroom, as well as at home.  These programs track and improve reading skills.  As 
mentioned earlier, students in grades K-2 will be given an ENL Tool Kit to support their reading, writing, listening and speaking 
in class and during ENL services.  Also, across grades 3-5, students will use their Student Assessment Handbook to support their 
learning in all modalities. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All notices of school programs and events are sent home in multiple languages when possible.  All other notification of school 
programs are stamped with prominent placement of "translation required" stamp.   ELLs are encouraged to try out for school 
teams such as the basketball and cheerleading squad as well as apply to be school service monitors and members of the 
student government. All ELL students who apply for a school service position are given their first or second choice.  The 
basketball, cheerleading, and student government position are either determined by skill level or election.  In school, all ELL 
students participate in the arts programs such as music, modern dance and ballroom dancing. After school and supplemental 
services offered to ELLs include the Title III Saturday Program, ASAP (Arts and Science Appreciation Program) after school, and 
CASA multi-cultural arts program.  All ELL students in grades 4 and 5 participate in Enrichment Clusters during school time. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The school has an extensive ENL lending library. Books and books on CD are available for in-class listening centers and at home 
use.  A variety of materials are used to increase literacy skills, such as realistic fiction and nonfiction trade books for Social 
Studies and Science,  as well as modified reading units that align with ReadyGen topics for entering, emerging and transitioning 
ELLs.  Each class with ENL students has its own bilingual library, along with picture dictionaries in languages corresponding to 
those of students. Computers in classrooms are used constantly throughout the day.  Together the ELL teacher and the 
classroom teacher come up with  a list of appropriate websites for ELL students targeting literacy and content area knowledge 
and skills. Many ELLs in various grades are enrolled in the Imagine Learning computer program.  ENL students also use 
ThinkCentral, BrainpopESL, Brainpop, Brainpop Jr., RazKids, and iReady on iPads or computers throughout the day as needed. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

For our classrooms with ENL students, we provide bilingual libraries, including content glossaries and picture dictionaries. 
These are available to take home as well.  Peer language support is encouraged.  For example, for some small group instruction 
entering and emerging students will be placed with students who speak their native language in order for them to be 
supported.  We have also created a program called Language Buddies to support the entering and emerging students in the 
lower grades.  Language Buddies are upper grade students (grades 3-5) who are commanding, or never ELLs that are proficient 
in English and their native language.  These students are monitors for the lower grade classes with entering and emerging 
ELLs.  They help translate for newcomers and give native language supports to our ENL students. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All ELL support services are aligned to grade level Common Core Standards and New Language Arts Progressions.  Students are 
grouped by proficiency level within each grade.  In some cases for students who require standalone ENL services, contiguous 
grade heterogeneous groups are created for pullout. For integrated ENL services on each grade, the ENL teacher works and 
plans closely with the classroom teachers to ensure that supports are aligned to the curriculum, scope and sequence, CCSS, 
and NLAP.  Supports such as, grade specific bilingual glossaries for ELA, math, science, and social studies are given to ELL 
students to use during ENL instruction, as well as throughout the day in their classroom.  Grade and age appropriate texts 
relating to the social studies or science scope and sequence, or taken from the ReadyGen literacy program are either used or 
modified for ENL instruction in order to ensure that students are meeting Common Core Standards. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
ELL specialist and Parent Coordinator make outreach to new ELL families.  Specific ELL Parent workshops are offered during 
Tuesday parent engagement, such as “Getting to Know P.S.184’s ENL Program” in the fall and “Taking the NYSESLAT” in the 
spring.  Parents of ELLs are also invited to other workshops created by the Parent Coordinator.  All invitations for workshops, 
as well as Parent Teacher Association events are sent out in multiple languages.  Newly enrolled ELLs are immediately given a 
Language Buddy after enrollment, to help their transition into the school community.  In the upper grades, the Language 
Buddy will be a classmate that will help give native language support, and answer any questions.  In the lower grades, students 
may have a Language Buddy in their class, but they will also have an upper grade Language Buddy that may take the same bus 
as them or be a monitor for their class.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

P.S. 184Q does not have language electives as part of our school program. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ELL personnel at our school includes the ENL Instructional Mentor, common branch teachers who have ELLs in their classes, 
guidance counselors, various therapists, pupil personnel secretary, parent coordinator and administration. At this time we 
have no paraprofessionals working with ELL students.  The ENL Instructional Mentor attends grade level and schoolwide 
meetings, as well as professional development sessions during Monday afternoons. Emphasis is placed on developing small 
group instructional strategies for literacy and math, as well as strategies for developing academic vocabulary. She also 
participates in curriculum mapping for all grades aligning literacy and content area standards. The Queens North Field Supper 
Center and DOE also provide ongoing professional development sessions which are attended by the ELL Instructional Mentor. 
This information from the monthly Queens North Borough Field Support Center meetings is shared with the school personnel 
who work with ELLs.  Professional development for these specific staff members is conducted by the ELL Instructional Mentor 
on specific Monday afternoons; 9/25, 11/20, 1/22, 2/12, 3/19, 5/21.  Topics covered in these sessions include best practices for 
co-teaching in an ELL classroom, integrating language into content instruction, using the EDAT to inform instruction, new 
mandates and overall compliance, as well as topics turnkeyed from Borough Field Support Center meetings.  The ENL 
Instructional Mentor also meets with occupational, physical and speech therapists to discuss the progress of ELL students who 
receive these services.  The pupil personnel secretary and the ENL Instructional Mentor also meet to discuss registration and 
compliance with respect to ATS.  The parent coordinator and the ENL Instructional mentor meet to discuss translation and 
interpretation for upcoming events.   
In-house professional development is held to address the new Common Core aligned curricula, as well as the New Language 
Arts Progressions and how they impact ELL instruction. Study groups are formed to focus on areas of teacher need and 
growth.  Some of these study groups are centered on incorporating ELL strategies into all content areas.  There is also ongoing 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 

extensive professional development in using thinking maps in all content areas to help students meet standards. Scaffolding 
strategies, such as using prompts, pictures and modifying tasks and materials are reviewed and put to use as needed. 
Additional outside opportunities for professional development provided by DOE and/or Queens North Borough Field Support 
Center are attended if offered. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
As per CR Part 154.2, the ENL/ESL Specialist (now known as the ENL Instructional Mentor) will attend Queens North Borough 
lead meetings.  The ENL Instructional Mentor will share information learned from these meetings with all teachers.  The ENL 
Instructional Mentor will also conduct professional development sessions during the 80 minute allotted time on Mondays that 
will explain new ELL  mandates and vocabulary, as well as ELL strategies to use in the classroom.  These professional 
development sessions will satisfy the 15% of total hours for all teachers as mandates by CR Part 154.2.  The ENL Instructional 
Mentor will also seek other professional development opportunities through the DOE, Queens North Borough Field Support 
Center, and other TESOL organizations in order to satisfy the 50% of total hours.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At P.S. 184Q, parents are welcome to contact the teacher at any time using the proper channels to set up a meeting about 
their child’s progress.  Progress of ELL students are provided to ELL parents during Parent Teacher Conferences, as well as 
during DOE Parent Engagement Nights.  Individual parent meetings for ELL parents will be held in addition to parent teacher 
conferences. In addition, during the 16-17 school year parents were given additional opportunities to communicate with the 
ELL teacher and obtain information about progress during the Title III Saturday Program parent workshops.  We will continue 
these meetings during future Title III programs. Also, classrooms teachers and the ELL teacher are able to make outreach to 
the parents and have meetings about progress during the weekly Tuesday afternoon parent engagement period.  Efforts are 
always made to have a qualified translator present during these meetings using resources such as other teachers, paras, 
student teachers, community members, or the phone translation system.  Parents are also informed that they may bring their 
own translator. All meetings with ELL parents are logged and recorded.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
ELL parents attend and participate in school curriculum events and celebrations, as well as PTA meetings regularly.  ELL parents 
are invited to participate in events such as the PTA Paint Night, Wonderwalk, McDonald's Night,  Fifth Grade Dance, class trips, 
Holiday Parties, Winter Fair, classroom celebrations, open school week, meet the teacher night, and End term Party. Ongoing 
communication with the parent coordinator keeps ELL parents abreast of school happenings and learning opportunities.  The 
Parent Coordinator plans and offers specific workshops for all parents on a monthly basis.  Due to the fact that many of our ELL 
families live outside the school zone due to skip zoning, the parent coordinator makes outreach to arrange car pools to make it 
easier for those families to participate in events and programs outside the school day. In addition, parents have access to the 
school website www.ps184q.com where they can see up to date important school information, parent letters, and grade 
specific updates.  All efforts are made to provide translation or translated materials for parents in their home 
language.  Letters and flyers are either sent home translated or with a "translation required" stamp.  Use of qualified 
translators and or the phone translation service is also used when possible and appropriate. Throughout the year, ELL parents 
had opportunites to attend workshops given by the ELL specialist, Title III Saturday Parent Workshops, and curriculum 
celebrations including Student of the Month and the Parent Engagement Night.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Anna Dimilta, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess the language preferences of the parent community P.S. 184Q looks at the information 
presented in the HLIS. We also print out the RAPL to determine preferred language for written and oral 
communication. 
In addition, the ATS OTELE language code forms, emergency cards, teacher surveys and Parent Coordinator input 
are used  
to determine which parents, and which languages, have a need for translated documents and/or translators. 
Translated versions  
of all NYC DOE documents, handbooks, etc. are routinely distributed. Translated versions of parent letters on the 
NYC website are utilized as well. Interpretation and Translation services are provided by the NYC DOE by phone
