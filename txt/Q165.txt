Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS 165Q is located in the tree-lined Kew Garden Hills section of Flushing, where approximately 760 students from 
culturally diverse backgrounds attend our Pre-Kindergarten to Grade Five school. The inviting and well-kept school 
building showcases our pride in the students’ accomplishments with prominently displayed student work. We 
continually reflect on best teaching practices and carefully analyze student learning and progress to continue to meet 
the diverse needs of the students and their families. 

In addition to offering a general music instruction program, PS 165Q offers a two-year violin program for fourth and 
fifth grade gifted and talented students, band instrument instruction for fourth and fifth graders, recorder to third 
graders, and choral enrichment to grades 2 through 5. For the last eleven years, our students have been chosen to 
participate, with their violins and recorders, in a live performance at Carnegie Hall with the St. Luke’s Orchestra. 

At PS 165Q, dance education provides students with challenging opportunities as creators, performers and 
choreographers. Our students have performed at such prestigious events as Lincoln Center, The Apollo Theater, and 
the NYC Dance Parade and NYC Dance Festival. Our Dance Clubs participate in the NYC Dance Parade down Broadway 
in New York City and the NYC Dance Educators UFT Performance at Long Island City High School. 

Our visual art education provides students with an outlet for their creativity and imagination. One first grader 
previously won the NYC School Wellness Art Contest and another first grader previously won the PS Art 2015 
Competition. A fourth grader was a finalist in the Ezra Jack Keats Book competition. Several students won Morgan 
Book Project awards. 
 
Other essential student activities include an active Student Council with leadership opportunities for valued student 
input and decision making. Our PS 165Q “Shooting Stars” basketball team encourages fourth and fifth graders to learn 
the sport and collaborate as a team. A cheerleading squad affords students the opportunity to develop self-esteem as 
they showcase dynamic teamwork in performing at school events and basketball games. Students also have the 
opportunity to compete in a school-wide spelling bee and story telling contest. 
 
A series of parent workshops offer opportunities to learn about curriculum, standards, assessments, educational goal 
setting, student progress and how to help children succeed in school. Masterful Parenting is a workshop led by our 
Parent Coordinator and our Guidance Counselor where parents gain necessary tools needed in building 
communication and strengthening social emotion skills with their children. Additionally, our parents who are English 
language learners are offered regular Conversational English classes through our "Cross Roads Cafe" program.  
 
Collaborating with The Usdan Center for Creative and Performing Arts, the Center for Arts Education provides 
approximately 20 scholarships for a summer Performing Arts camp experience for student enrichment. Parent

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 165Q is an all inclusive school, with 41 classes, ranging from pre-k to grade 5, with three self-contained classes, 
twenty ICT , and the NYC Gifted and Talented Program classes on every grade. 

 

-->Gifted & Talented: We take pride in being one of the most established and longstanding Gifted & Talented 
programs in District 25. We have dedicated Gifted & Talented classes on every grade and multiple Gifted & Talented 
classes in a few grades. These classes follow an enrichment model, whereby classes follow Common Core curricula, 
student interest, and project-based learning in order to exceed grade-level standards. Gifted & Talented teachers 
have studied student-centric teaching methodologies, such as Socratic Seminars an the IIM (Double I M) Model.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

-->Differentiated support learned from the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) program: Incorporating best practices 
from the ASD program throughout the building (i.e. brain breaks, movement breaks, quiet corners, voice scales), has 
helped students deal with the demands of stamina, sitting too long, establishing levels of appropriate conduct and 
providing an area for students who are overly stimulated to decompress and prepare for the next steps of the day. 
Sharing tiered intervention from this program has supported all the learners in the building achieve the higher levels 
of learning. 

 

-->Differentiated support for our English Language Learners incorporates best practices for our ENLs including using 
visuals, pre-testing, and scaffolding learning. Our ENL teachers use both a push in and pull out model to ensure that 
students' learning is supported. We have two and a half dedicated ENL teachers in order to service learners along the 
ENL continuum. All staff focuses on developing Academic Language. . 

 

-->Students at-risk for referral Through the use of a Child Study Team/ PPT, a team that consists of administrators, 
guidance counselors, the School Assessment Team, ELL teachers, and AIS/SETSS teachers, we collaboratively discuss 
and identify students at-risk for referral. This team tracks student referrals as well as at-risk students using the 
Student Tracker Doc on Google to monitor next steps, check progress, revise services and initiate tiered Response to 
Intervention plans. This team also creates alternative schedules for students to offer optimal support for their 
social/emotional needs. For example, a handful of students were identified as struggling in the lunch room with 
stimulation. Therefore, these students are now meeting with our PBIS Specialist and/or Guidance Counselor during 
lunch to learn social, coping, and sensory regulation skills in order to strategically include them into lunch and recess 
opportunities.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

This year we made gains (from 4.09 to 4.51) in Effective School Leadership, as evidenced by the 2017-2018 School 
Survey. This increase was due to the targeted and deliberate work of the administrative team to leverage teacher 
leadership and shared decision making in terms of curriculum, pedagogy, and parent engagement. In addition, the 
transparency about progress monitoring systems ensured a positive school community. The school leaders also 
communicated daily and weekly to keep all staff informed about school programs and or events. School Leadership 
also created an "Open Door Policy for all stakeholders including students to ensure all voices were valued and heard. 
These deliberate changes helped to create a culture of trust between staff and administration, and families.  

The area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year is Strong Family - Community Ties. The School Leadership Team and 
PTA are planning diligently on how to re-imagine and re-define what "Family Engagement" looks like and sounds like 
at P.S. 165Q. We are also in "think tanks" about how to lift the level of cooperation / partnership with local 
community based organizations, small businesses, and local politicians / leaders.  

Another key area of focus is Supportive Environment. In addition to research and standards based curriculum, P.S. 165 
will do a deep dive in supporting students' and staff's social and emotional needs. The Administration Team, the 
Positive Behavior Specialist, the Guidance Team, the ASD Coach, and the Parent Coordinator have partnered with the 
Office of School Health to provide additional support on mental health for students and staff. The following are a few 
goals / priorities to support this initiative. 

Student skill building to improve social and emotional functioning 

 
  Training the staff to respond to mental health needs 
 
  Counseling of students to resolve academic, social, and personal problems 

Family support and engagement

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Comprehensive Assessment: 

  Based on a June 2018 analysis of component 3d on the Danielson rubric it was found that 7.99% of teachers 

scored a developing. 

  Based on a review of the New York City School survey data, one area of need is academic press. 68% of 

teachers responded that a majority of the students in their classes respond to challenging questions in class. 
  Based on a review of the June 2018 Fountas & Pinnell benchmarks, ENL students have made progress but are 

still performing below grade level. 

  Based on EOY Go Math! assessment data, students need more work with explaining their mathematical 

thinking. 

  Based on June Instructional Report, we have indicated standards in need of mastery. ( waiting on this) 

Strengths: 

  All teachers worked diligently on our former school-wide instructional focus on assessment . Students are 

aware of the assessment criteria and regularly self assess. 

  Professional Learning strengthening the teachers understanding of conceptual math through working 

collaboratively with Math Solutions and administrators leading Math Team Leader work. 

  Teachers' ability to revise and modify Go Math! to meet the needs of diverse learners in their classrooms, 

using the backwards workshop model.  

  Teachers created a responsive test sophistication unit to prepare for state exams. 

Needs: 

  Continued quarterly monitoring of reading level data and writing products.  
  Continued unpacking of math Exemplars.  
  Continue to provide RTI and at risk services to those students not meeting the quarterly benchmarks.  
  Continued professional development on using formative assessment for informing instruction and flexibly 

grouping students.  

  Continued professional development on 3d component on the Danielson rubric to increase students abilities 

to articulate their thinking. 

  Continued professional development on academic press: conducting discussion and responding to build on 

one another's ideas during class discussions.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers and administrators will engage in professional learning cycles around best pedagogical practices 
in mathematics, which are aligned to Next Generation Standards, and will result in students enhancing their conceptual 
understanding and analytical reasoning in mathematics. This goal’s progress will result in a 5% increase in grade-level 
performance on school-wide formative assessments and students receiving a 3 or 4 on the NYS Math Exam.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
In September 2018 we will begin our parent/family professional development opportunities with a welcome back 
workshop that will detail instructional and behavioral expectations. Each teacher will provide a high level overview on 
what conceptual and rigorous mathematics is. Classroom teachers will take parents through rigorous math tasks and 
all its steps and solution paths. Parents will also receive handouts on problem solving strategies to support their 
children at home. 

During Monthly PTA meetings when the principal gives her "Principal report" she will include updates in math units of 
study work. This will take place regularly. Included in this report will be tips for parents/families to strengthen/ 
support math instruction. 

Starting in October, each classroom teacher will inform parents of regular math celebrations during math end-of-unit 
celebrations and or gallery walks. During the celebrations students and teachers will highlight the Next Generation 
Standard and task students focused on. 

In November, during Parent Teacher conferences students will take the lead and have Student-Led conferences and 
show parents/families their mathematical thinking across various math topics/units. Students will share their math 
journeys, including their strengths and struggles, with process and or content. 

During the Tuesdays' Parent Engagement time, parents will have the opportunities to meet and discuss curriculum 
adjustments and revisions based on classroom assessments and student needs in math, as needed. 

 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Comprehensive Assessment:  

● We analyzed these reports and looked for trends (time and location), and noted that staff needed more support 
with positive behavior strategies.  

● We have analyzed the classroom behavior results from the 2017-2018 school year. 

● We have analyzed the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey Report and noted teachers indicate student safety and 
behavior were a concern. 

Created and reviewed school based surveys regarding the school environment and used that data to plan for future 
activities to support enhancing the school climate for both staff and students.  

Strengths:

specific data and specify next steps in math. Specific next 
steps will be identified for students with English as a New 
Language and Students with Disabilities in order to create 
supports within the lesson to help them be successful. 
Teachers will identify sub-groups on which to focus inquiry 
cycles, based on state and school data, such as Periodic 
Assessments, F & P levels, standards-based spreadsheets, 
NYS Math Data, and i-Ready data. We will continue to look 
closely at the data of our black and Latino students who are 
not making adequate progress and create targeted action 
plans for them. Strategies will include one on one, small 
group pre-teaching and re-teaching, use of manipulative, 
visuals and prompts. Charts will reflect current units and be 
used by students to support their learning. Technology 
including smart-boards, and i-Pads will be used to create an 
individual learning path for students to practice. 

A few professional development Mondays will be devoted to 
improving teacher understanding of the inquiry-based math 
model to improve their math pedagogy. 

  Targeted math PD in order to help familiarize 

teachers with the tool and provide by 
Metamorphosis, the administrative team, and math 
lead teachers to improve teacher's math pedagogy.  

  Professional learning for teacher leaders 

surrounding the effective use of inquiry protocols in 
order to guide teacher learning in math.

students of the month. Principal provides updates on school priorities and events.  
Social media (twitter/Facebook) to keep parents abreast of updates and celebrate events. 
Frequent use of BlackBoard connect to call parents with updates.  

 
 
  Weekly Parent communication Time where parents are invited in for meetings, hold phone conversations 

with teachers, and partake in celebrations across different grades throughout the school.  

  PTA fund raising and events (Scholastic Book Fair, Valentine Orders, Brain Challenge, PBIS Bake Sales, etc.) 
  Dedicated evening events (Magical Math Night, Reading Under the Stars, Parents as Reading Partners, 

Curriculum Night, Multicultural Night, Bricks 4 Kidz, various arts performances, etc.) 

  Monthly grade-specific curriculum maps sent home so that parents can support their child's learning in 

school. 

  An ever-evolving school website that connects parents to various classrooms, identifies events and 
celebrations, includes a monthly digital calendar, and links to free and school-purchased websites. 

Needs: 

  More effective parent communication system, which may include an e-mail system, and detailed outgoing 

calls, thereby allowing for the ability to send out quick and efficient school-wide alerts, reminders, and 
invitations. 

  Consistent earlier reminders regarding events involving parents/guardians/families.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
All teachers on the 2017-2018 BEDs Survey are highly qualified. When hiring new teachers we insists on highly 
qualified teachers ie. all teachers have completed the New York State Education requirements. In recruiting new 
teachers we rely on our College partnerships, HR liaison at the Borough office and recommendations from colleagues. 
We retain highly qualified teachers by providing them mentoring support and weekly professional development from 
our staff, administrators and outside partnerships including Living Literacy LLC. We additionally have provided 
"Coaching" periods in senior teachers schedules in order to work with and mentor new teachers, even those who do 
not require mentoring through the DOE. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
At P.S. 165Q, we engage in high degrees of professional development in line with our Instructional Focus: Students 
will develop skills in academic language by:  

  Exposure to new vocabulary in multiple contexts,  
 
  Providing opportunities to use newly learned words across disciplines.  

Intentional teaching of word meanings, and  

The above instructional focus was developed and chosen after a staff surveyed was administered, and staff indicated 
its need.

intervention services, etc.). 
We utilize the following ongoing transition plan: 

  Parent workshops regarding transitioning from pre-kindergarten to kindergarten 
  Parent workshops regarding dealing with emotions (frustration, sadness, anger etc.) 
  Parent-Orientation for pre-k and a segmented schedule to ease anxiety on the first day of school 
  Kindergarten parent orientation in June to help parents understand transition to kindergarten and 

expectations of kindergarten 

  Monthly newsletters identifying curriculum and activities that are aligned to the Pre-K CCLS. 
  Work Sampling is a system for implementing ongoing, authentic assessment in the pre-kindergarten 

classroom. This system is made up of three complementary elements: checklists and guidelines, portfolios, 
and summary reports, which are shared with the parents. Progress and performance are assessed in seven 
domains. These domains are aligned to the Pre-K CCLS 

  Collaboration with entire grade using online grade rubrics to collaborate and house units and lessons. 

Incorporating CCLS aligned units to teaching practices. 

  Use of Google Docs to share documents, record minutes and next steps from the Pre-kindergarten teachers’ 

Professional Learning Committee meetings and identification of student strengths and needs, using the 
inquiry protocol, which is captured on a Google Doc. 
students in need of early intervention are referred to Committee for Pre-School Education (CPSE) 

 
  CPSE arranges for special education services within the classroom or through RSAs for services to the students 
 

in-house and agency-supplied related service providers provide targeted intervention to students, with 
support to the classroom teacher and to the parent 

  Enrichment opportunities for pre-kindergarten and kindergarten (Tae Kwon Do, in-house trips, aligned with 

their thematic units, for pre-kindergarten).

PS 165Q's instructional focus was Assessment of Learning for the past three years, and we have been engaged in 
cultivating strong assessment practices surrounding this instructional focus. We have used the past two years to 
continue to strengthen and deepen our instructional focus: Assessment of Learning, noting exemplary practices that 
have been observed in the classroom. This year, for example, we collaboratively developed and shared strong 
assessment practices, by grade, in order to begin the year with these practices. We videotaped teachers engaged in 
strong assessment practices and analyzed these practices at professional learning. Our professional learning is geared 
towards enhancing assessment practices throughout the grades and ensuring assessment data is deeply analyzed and 
understood. The overarching goal of our PD Plan is to improve assessment of learning to cultivate a culture of self-
regulated, purposeful, dedicated learners.  

 

Grade-level and cluster-specialist teams of teachers meet weekly to study student data and/or curriculum in order to 
make team decisions and maximize instruction. We use the inquiry protocol in order to analyze individual student, 
grade-level, and school-wide data and adjust and improve instruction and student outcomes. We track student 
progress through shared standards-based Google spreadsheets, noting reading levels and end-of-unit assessments. In 
the upper-grades, we use Performance Assessment Data from SchoolNet, as well as Instructional and Item Analysis 
reports from NYS tests, in order to identify key standards of focus to leverage student learning. Our grade Data Team 
Leaders are charged with both leading their grades’ protocol for guiding inquiry work and providing next steps for 
teaching and learning. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 165Q, The Edith K. Bergtraum Elementary School, in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. Parents receive Parent Handbooks, outlining protocols and procedures, to ensure 
understanding of school culture and prevent and confusion. Parents are kept informed through a myriad of 
communicative tools, including an online list-serve for email communication, school website, and active social media 
accounts. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

P.S. 165Q, The Edith K. Bergtraum Elementary School, will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

● Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

●Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

       The Title III ENL Super Academy and the ENL Stars Academy here at PS 165 Queens, is a 
supplemental program that will provide additional support for English Language Learners.   This 
afternoon program will meet on Wednesday and Thursday  from 2:45pm- 3:45pm.   The 
projected start date of this program will be December 1st. 
The duration of this program will be 12 weeks.  The target population for this program is  two 
classes of 16  students at the Entering, Emerging, Transitioning or Expanding  level of English 
Language Proficiency based on the NYSESLAT and/or newcomers to the country in grades 3-
4.  This program will be taught by an ENL and content area teacher.   To select students for this 
program, NYSESLAT scores are examined spanning over 2 years and progress is looked 
at.  Additionally, the breakdown of each modality's progress (reading, writing, listening, and 
speaking)is examined to determine the area of strengths/weaknesses each student has. The 
number of points gone up or down will be assessed in each modality to determine overall 
progress.  State ELA scores will also be examined to chart progress and identify ELL students 
who need additional support. Teacher recommendation is also considered based on teacher's 
running records, pre and post assessments in reading and writing, and observations. 
When examining our ELL data as of 6/20/18 there are  72 students at the Newcomer level 0-
3  years ,  8 students at the Developing level 4-6 years of service and no long term ells.  In 
addition,  when examining proficiency levels based on the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL for grades 
2-3,  18 students scored on the expanding level.  15 on the commanding level, 11 on the 
transitioning level ,  3 on the emerging level and 4 on the entering level.   This data will be 
updated in September 2018 when current NYSESLAT scores are available.   
      When looking further at the data and the progress of students in the different modalities it 
was noted that students were making more progress in listening and speaking overall than 
reading and writing. 
When assessing the needs of our students, it was determined support was needed in reading and 
writing. Students will be engaged in reading and writing activities to increase instructional 
reading level and independent reading level.   To support students in their home language, 
dictionaries in Chinese will be purchased since a majority of the ELL students are literate in that 
language.  In addition, picture books will be purchased in Chinese to support these students. 
  
     A fully certified ENL teacher and content area teacher will provide afternoon instruction to 
support these students in the area of reading and writing. This service will be above and beyond 
the students' mandated number of ENL minutes, as per Part 154.   
  
This ENL teacher  will conduct small group instruction using ENL methodologies, guided 
reading and targeted academic vocabulary instruction for students in grades 3-4. ENL/Content 
Area teachers will use the Treasure Chest for English Language Learners program published by 
McMillian to support students in reading, writing, listening, and speaking.   Students will be 
grouped by reading level and ENL proficiency levels as well as classroom teacher input.  There 
will be a 8 to 1 ratio with the ENL or content area teacher.   The content area teacher will

provide  writing instruction and the ENL teacher will provide reading and vocabulary 
instruction.   The  academic instruction will also be provided through the use of a wide array of 
content area materials published by Mondo (guided reading/writing kits), Finish Line N.Y. ELL 
Common Core books and National Geographic content area writing kit.   The ENL teacher will 
group students based on reading ability and rotate groups and activities to engage the ELL 
students in targeted guided reading instruction to enhance their reading skills.  Interactive writing 
will be used to support their writing development and small group lessons to target grammar and 
usage.   The content area teacher will provide small group instruction on a rotating basis with the 
ENL teacher to provide additional support in writing.  To support students in their home 
languages, dictionaries in Chinese,Spanish, and Urdu published by Heineman press will be 
provided for students  to support their language needs.  In addition, billingual literature published 
by Scholastic will be available for students during independent reading  The materials used for 
the Title III program are separate from the programs being used during the school day.   
  
     In addition, an ENL Stars academy will be conducted by a  certified ENL teacher and content 
area teacher, two times a week for 12weeks. The target population for this program will be two 
classes of  16 students in grades 1-2 who scored at the Entering, Emerging, or Transitioning level 
on the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL. There will be an 8 to 1 teacher to student ratio for 
instruction.   This program will run for 12 weeks. 
The projected start date will be January 16th.   
 The data used to select students for this program will be NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores, 
teacher recommendation, running records, and pre/post assessments.   When  analyzing the 
NYSESLAT data as of 6/20/18, 7 students scored at the expanding level, 13 students scored at 
the commanding level, 4 students scored at the transitioning level ,3 students 
 scored at the emerging level and 3 students at the entering level.  This data will be updated in 
September 2018 when current NYSESLAT scores are available.  Additionally, the breakdown of 
each modalities progress in reading, writing, listening and speaking will be examined to 
determine the strengths  and weaknesses that each child has.  Afternoon classes will be scheduled 
two days a week (Wednesday and Thursday) from 2:40 to 3:40pm. A certified ENL teacher will 
be teaching this program  with a content area teacher.  
 
The ENL and content  teachers  will conduct small group instruction using ENL methodologies, 
guided reading, and targeted academic vocabulary instruction. The ENL/Content area teachers 
will use the Treasure Chest for English Language Learners to support ELL students in reading, 
writing, listening, and speaking.  The ENL teacher will provide the reading and vocabulary 
instruction and the Content Area teacher will provide the writing instruction.   The teacher will 
break the students into groups based on their reading and writing ability and conduct rotating 
guided reading/center activities to enhance their reading and writing skills.    In addition, the 
Reader for Writers program published by National Geographic will be used to enhance students 
reading and writing skills as well as integrate the content areas of science and social studies 
support the curriculum.  In addition Guided Reading kits published by Mondo will be used for 
instruction.  To support students in their home language, dictionaries in Chinese, Spanish, and 
Urdu published by Heineman Press will to provided to students who are literate in their home 
language to support their learning.  In addition, bilingual texts published by Scholastic will be 
available to students who are literate in their home language.     These programs  are only used in 
the Title III program and is not used during the school day.     
 
     Records will be maintained in the ENL teachers office in a binder.  Attendance will be taken 
daily and copies of monthly attendance records will be kept in the office and in the Title III 
binder.  Copies of parent letters in preferred languages will be kept in the Title III binder.

Staff Development 
 At PS 165Q, the ENL teachers and classroom teachers have been working on differentiation 
strategies  and scaffolds for ELLs as well as providing ELLs with tools they can use to complete 
grade level tasks.   In order to continue this work, ENL certified teachers  as well as classroom 
teachers who have a large number of ELLs will attend District  and DELLSS  workshops on 
ENL-related topics such as ENL methodologies, the SIOP model, text complexity, and academic 
vocabulary.   These workshops will occur once a month in various locations.  Our ENL teachers 
will also participate in monthly District Professional Development with our District  ENL 
support point person.  The teachers who attend these workshops will turnkey on topics such as 
data driven instruction, vocabulary instruction and writing instruction.  They will turnkey this 
valuable information to teachers during professional development time on Mondays during 
scheduled professional development time at no cost to the Title III program.  This will help 
teachers meet the 15% ELL professional development requirement as per the Part 
154.   Attendance and agendas will be kept in the ENL office in  Title III binder.  
A study group will be conducted for  teachers for 8 sessions meeting Friday morning 7:20am-
8:20am.  The teachers will unpack an academic vocabulary guide that is part of a city wide 
initiative.  During these sessions, teachers will use the guide to design lessons to support our ells 
language development.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments are used to get a baseline assessment in the beginning of the school year for all 
students including ELLs. Classroom and ELL teachers do a running record with each student to assess the students reading level 
and letter and sound recognition.  The data provides teachers with an instructional level to start with and assists in grouping 
students into guided reading and skill groups within the classroom.  After the baseline is administered, classroom and ELL 
teachers  collaborate to look at the data and examine whether ELL students are on grade level.    Flexible groups are made and 
the teachers collaborate on strategies and materials they will use to support the students.  LLI, a research based intervention 
program is used for guided reading to support ELL reading, language, and vocabulary development. Fountas and Pinnell 
literacy assessments are administered two more times throughout the school year, formally and informally, as per the 
teacher's discretion.   A Google doc of students progress in each class is kept and progress is tracked throughout the year.  The 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

data provides information about how ELLs are progressing in reading and comprehension and which strategies are working to 
support their growth.  This data guides our instructional planning by looking  for areas of intervention such as fluency, 
comprehension, and academic vocabulary development Progress is noted as well as deficiencies and we can design our 
instructional plan to meet the needs of our ELL students.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

     To support this effort, ELL teachers along with Administrative Cabinet examine the EDAT report and identify students who 
have several risk factors.  Data findings are shared with classroom teachers via grade and school level meetings. Teachers 
discuss different strategies based on formative assessments and students strengths and weaknesses.  Teachers design clear 
goals for students based on their learning needs. In addition,  strategies are implemented  to support students.  This ongoing 
effort is done in cycles and  ELL and classroom teachers evaluate student progress and modify instruction throughout the 
year.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The baseline benchmark assessments that are used for ELL students are NYSESLAT,  EDAT, ELA, I Ready, Imagine Learning, and 
Performance based assessments such as pre-assessments and post assessments for each writing unit.  ENL teachers along with 
Administrative Cabinet examine the EDAT report and identify students who have several risk factors based on the data.  Data 
findings are shared with classroom teachers via grade and school level meetings along with inquiry grade teams.  In addition, 
progress reports and baseline assessment reports are available to examine and identify students progress and areas of need.    
      After reviewing the data, the areas of need that have been identified for ELLs are reading and writing.  In looking at the 
NYSESLAT data many ELLs are moving up from the lower levels, but are not moving beyond expanding.  When further 
examining each individual area students are not moving up in the areas of reading and writing.  In looking at reading level data 
using Fontas and PInnell, ELLs are making progress overall, but are still having difficulty reaching those grade level 
benchmarks.  More specifically, ELLs are having difficulty with the comprehension questions in regards to reading a benchmark 
book although they can read the book.  In addition, ELLs are showing progress on the web based programs they are using and 
lessons are targeting the areas of need such as grammar, phonics, sentence structure, and reading comprehension.   
      
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered by the ENL and classroom teachers, they analyze the data from the EDAT report 
in terms of progress on the ELA and NYSESLAT exams over two years.  ELL teachers will look at students NYSESLAT scores 
broken down by modality (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) and note areas of need as well as strengths.      
     In addition, grade level teams with ELL teachers confer during inquiry team meetings to analyze the data, group students 
within their areas of need and discuss possible interventions and strategies to address these needs.  Some of the interventions 
that are used are lessons from IREADY which are based on student results from baseline assessments.  This program 
continuously monitors student growth in areas of need which teachers can examine throughout the school year to adjust their 
interventions and groups for differentiated instruction.   
    Data gathered from Imagine Learning gives classroom and ELL teachers information regarding students language acquisition 
needs. Teachers will use the data gathered to group students and add differentiation into lessons to support student language 
needs.  Teachers will utilize suggested resources from Imagine Learning to support ELL students based on the data. This data 
will be monitored throughout the year as students continue using Imagine Learning.   
      
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
     The school uses data to drive instruction within the RTI model for ELLs by conferring with classroom teachers, 
administrators, and ELL teachers . Analyzed data determines  the educational needs of entitled  ELLs. .   Students are 
administered the Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments to assess their reading skills at the beginning of each school 
year.  From the results of these assessments, classroom and ENL teachers examine data to evaluate where the students 
reading level falls in conjunction with the grade level the students are in.  ELL student levels of language acquisition based on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

their NYSESLAT scores are considered when examining this data.  
Tier II RTI groups are set up based on students deficits in different areas of literacy such as decoding, comprehension, 
etc.  ENL and classroom teachers use LLI, a literacy intervention program, to do guided reading with ENL students who need 
support based on their needs.  These groups are flexible and can change based on students progress.  Progress is measured in 
four week cycles using running records and literacy assessments.    In addition, ELL students are placed on Imagine Learning, a 
research based program, which supports language development and literacy.   Students are placed in this program based on 
their NYSESLAT level and present level of language acquisition.   
     If the data shows that ELL students are not making progress , the students will be discussed by our school's Child Study 
Team.  This team is comprised of Administrators, ENL teachers, school psychologist, guidance counselors, and special 
education teachers.  After looking at the data and assessing the students progress, Tier III interventions are put into place 
based on the ELL students needs.   There are native language supports within this program for Spanish, Russian, Punjabi, and 
Chinese.  The SETTS or IEP teacher can also provide an intensive Tier III intervention using the Wilson reading program, 
Explode the Code, or guided reading.   
   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
   The outcome assessments that are used to evaluate and inform ELL programs are the NYSESLAT, ELA, MATH, Imagine 
Learning summative reports, and IREADY reports.  The RLAT and EDAT are generated in the beginning of the school year as 
well.   
     The data from the EDAT is generated at the beginning of the school year and used to examine the progress of ENL students 
over two years.  The number of risk factors is assessed for ELLs and progress is noted.  Areas of strengths and weaknesses are 
examined with teachers and administrators.  Using the data from the EDAT, ENL teachers can target their ENL instruction 
based on these needs.  Supplemental ELL programs for ELLs are implemented based on the data from the EDAT.   
     This data is used to evaluate and inform our ELL programs.  After examining the data from the NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math 
state assessments, we look at the programs students were involved in to support their learning such as Title III Reading and 
Wriing, ELA and Math academy, and AIS services as well as mandated ELL service.    Based on the data, we can look at the 
progress of the ELLs who attended these programs.  Adjustments will be made to these programs such as using different 
curricular materials, extending the cycles of the program, and using smaller groups to support ELL progress in areas of need 
according to the data.   
      
      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

    The structures that are in place to disseminate the findings are that ENL teachers first examine the data from the 
NYSESLAT at the beginning of the school year.  The data is analyzed in terms of how students are performing in each modality 
and the proficiency level they scored. Students that scored at the entering, emerging, or transitioning level on the 
NYSESLAT are invited to a TItle III ENL program.  In addition, students that scored on Expanding level, but have not shown 
progress over that last 2 years will also be invited to the program.  This program is tailored to the students needs based on the 
data.    
     Classroom teachers are given NYSESLAT scores, ELA and Math reports, and have access to their students reports on Imagine 
Learning and IREADY for their ENL students.  Classroom teachers and ENL teachers use these reports to plan instruction for ENL 
students and group students who have similar learning needs. 
    The EDAT report is first examined by the Administrative team and discussed with classroom teachers and ENL teachers at 
grade level meetings.  Each teacher and ENL teacher gets a copy of the EDAT for their class and can examine the students 
progress over time and how many risk factors each student has.  Classroom teachers will also invite students who are at risk so 
they can attend our early morning test sophistication program to provide them with further support based on their needs.  The 
program is separated into two cycles of math and ELA and students are placed in one or both cycles based on the data.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 PS 165Q employs a Stand-Alone/Integrated  organizational model as well as two classes with ELLs who are served by 
their classroom teachers who are ENL certified.  Kindergarten ELLs are placed in  a class where ENL instruction is 
provided by their classroom teacher, Paola Cayea  who is a fully certified in ENL. teacher.    First grade ELLs are placed 
in a class where ENL instruction is provided by their classroom teacher, Kerry DaSilva who is a fully certified ENL 
teacher.   Our ELLs are grouped heterogeneously by grade. 
 
The following staff members at PS 165 are fully certified to teach ENL: 
*Cynthia Luck-ENL K-6 
*Michele D’Amato-ENL/Elementary K-6 
* Paola Cayea-ENL/Elementary K-6 
* Kerry DaSilva ENL/Elementary K-6 
*Monley Wu ENL/Elementary K-6 
 
       Five fully certified staff members are organized to most effectively fulfill the mandated number of instructional 
minutes as per CR Part 154. 2. Three fully certified teachers push in and pull out grades K-5 to fulfill the Integrated 
ENL requirement for students who are at the Entering and Emerging level (180 minutes per week) and 
the Transitioning and Expanding levels (180 minutes).  ENL students on the same grade will travel from other classes 
with the certified ENL teacher to push into one class for Integrated ENL.  In addition, ENL students who scored at the 
Entering and Emerging level, who require 4 periods of stand alone ENL,  will be grouped over two contiguous grades 
and instruction will be provided by one of our certified ENL teachers Cynthia Luck, Michele D'Amato, or Christina 
Bendel.    In addition, students scoring at the Commanding Level will receive .5 units of transitional service per week 
using an Integrated Model.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

      To ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels, a  RICB report is 
generated from ATS as well as an RLAT report.  A master list is made of ELL students names and proficiency levels by grade and 
class.  Our school employs a stand alone/Integrated  model for ENL and two classes with certified ENL teachers on grades K 
and 1.  A schedule will be made for students organized by proficiency levels, grades and classes.  For students scoring at the 
Entering Level of proficiency a certified ENL teacher will work with these students across two contiguous grades when 
necessary to provide 1 unit of ENL per week.  The additional unit will be provided using an integrated model during the 
students ELA periods.  For students scoring at the Emerging level of proficiency, a certified ENL teacher will provide 1 unit of 
Stand Alone ENL.  In addition,  a certified ENL teacher will provide 1 unit of Integrated ENL.  Each grade employs common 
ELA periods so students at these levels will be brought into one class per grade to receive Integrated ENL/ELA 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

instruction.   Students scoring at the Transitional level will receive 1 unit of ENL using the integrated model.   Students scoring 
at the expanding level will receive one unit of ENL per week using an Integrated model.  Students scoring at the Commanding 
level will receive .5 unit of ENL using an Integrated model during their ELA period.  The two certified ENL teachers on grades 1 
and 2 will provide all ENL instruction for their ENL students in their class.   All of these students are programmed into a student 
tracking system STARS indicating the number of minutes and periods each student is programmed for based on their 
proficiency level.   STARS is reviewed periodically and compliance reports are reviewed to ensure that students are receiving 
the appropriate number of minutes per week.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
     Content areas are taught in English through the Integrated model based on students proficiency levels.   The co-teaching 
model is most frequently used to start a lesson.  Both teachers work cooperatively, teaching the same lesson at the same 
time.  The mainstream teacher may present the mini-lesson, and the ENL teacher will interject with examples, explanations 
and extensions of the key ideas.  The ENL teacher provides strategies to assist the students in better remembering and 
organizing information that was presented. ENL teacher will provide visual support for challenging vocabulary and provide 
explanations to help ELL students comprehend the material being taught.  The ENL teacher will also provide sentence frames 
and various scaffolds to support ENL students when participating in classroom discussions and answering higher order thinking 
questions.   Parallel teaching will also be used, with each teacher working in groups and the ENL teacher providing support for 
the ELLs in her group.   By learning in smaller groups, ELLs experience additional opportunities to interact with each other, 
listen to their peer models, volunteer responses, or receive feedback from the teacher. In addition, an ENL teacher will provide 
stand alone ENL to students who require it based on their proficiency level.  The ENL teacher will use different strategies which 
will include SIOP, differentiated texts on the same content being taught in the classroom, visual vocabulary support, and 
sentence frames to foster interactive language development during discussions.  Native language support will be provided 
using bilingual dictionaries in their native language,  texts in their native language, and videos in their native language to 
support the curriculum.  In addition, Imagine Learning software is used for entering and emerging students which has native 
language support for the students.  All of these methods are aligned using the common core standards.  
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

       P.S. 165 utilizes a variety of resources to ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages.  Translated 
editions of State assessments are supplied when available.  When no translations are available, the assessment is administered 
by a bilingual interpreter from our staff or from an outside agency contracted by the DOE who is familiar with assessment 
procedures.  Word to word bilingual glossaries are provided during assessments when appropriate.  Newly identified ELLs with 
Spanish as their home language are given the Spanish Lab.    This assessment provides information as to Spanish language 
proficiency.  
         ENL students use Imagine Learning, a research based program that supports ENL students English acquisition. Support in 
students first language when using this program is available in Spanish, Russian, and Chinese.   
        We are fortunate enough to have a bilingual (Spanish/English) School Based Support Team.  Maria Endara, our Family 
Worker provides informal initial interviews.  Maria Irigoyen, our school Psychologist, administers bilingual evaluations.  Nancy 
Laracuente-Guarin, our Social Worker initiates outreach to bilingual families.  
        Finally, we have numerous paraprofessionals and teachers who are fluent in many of the languages represented at our 
school.  These paraprofessionals work closely with assigned students to help them interpret academic material taught in the 
classroom.  The paraprofessionals provide feedback to classroom and ENL teachers on how the students are progressing in all 
academic areas.  They also support translation for parents when meeting with teachers to discuss students progress.   
 
    
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

a. 

SIFE   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

We do not have any SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education) at this time.  We will support 
 future SIFE by focusing on linguistic structures and reading.  
        The needs of newcomers (0-3 years) in the early stages of language acquisition are addressed by utilizing the following 
differentiation methodologies: use of pictures and other visual support; Total Physical Response; listening comprehension 
activities to build vocabulary; chants, songs and other repetitive whole-group activities; language chunking; and guided 
reading groups.  These strategies are incorporated into the school ELA program, Ready Gen and TC Writing units which are 
used in all classroom ELA instruction. In addition, teachers will scaffold difficult texts or provide additional content texts to 
build background and comprehension skills for our Newcomer students. Students will also be placed on Imagine Learning, a 
research based  computer program to help them develop their English Language skills.  This program provides first language 
support in the following languages: Spanish, Russian, and Chinese. 
        To differentiate for our developing  ELLs receiving service for 4 to 6 years of service, we look at their proficiency levels and 
their progress over time using the EDAT report to assess their risk factors and progress. To support these students we would 
look at their scores on each modality of the NYSESLAT and determine their strengths and weaknesses.  ELL teachers would 
confer with classroom teachers to review the findings.  Many of these students are on the expanding level.  In 
addition,  developing ELLs can be placed into RTI groups that  are created based on students’ common areas of weakness and 
targeted learning instruction is provided using different modalities . This additional support will be provided to these students 
who are stalled and are not making progress.  
        To provide differentiation for Long-Term ELLs, their proficiency levels will be examined and areas of strength and 
weakness will be noted.    Differentiated, small-group instruction, targeting students’ areas of weakness as indicated on pre 
and post assessments, NYSESLAT proficiency level and Fontas and Pinnell reading levels will be created.  Students will engage 
in classroom tasks with scaffolds to support their learning such as visual vocabulary support and differentiated texts on their 
reading level with the same content.    Students may receive RTI services in six-week rotations for additional small-group, 
differentiated instruction.  At this time, we do not have any Long-Term ELLs.  
        Former ELLs, who have tested proficient on the NYSESLAT continue to receive support in the classroom for two years after 
testing proficient using an Integrated model.  Differentiation will be provided as needed with conferring with the classroom 
teacher and progress will be monitored.   
    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
      For ELL-SWDs, we have discovered that TPR activities and chants/songs aid in making important vocabulary, phonics and 
grammar easier to remember. Dramatic presentations and role playing activities improve confidence and oral communication 
skills. In addition, balanced literacy activities such as shared reading, guided reading, interactive writing, and shared writing are 
used to support students acquisition of  reading and writing skills.  Once these basic tools for academic success have been 
absorbed, students are ready to learn to use them to create oral and written language and to comprehend content-area text, 
as well as fiction. The use of realia and hands-on activities makes the comprehension of academic vocabulary easier, and 
provide the opportunity for real usage of academic language that best accommodates development of permanent, readily 
retrievable knowledge. Thematic units of study are sometimes utilized to provide extended opportunities for these students to 
absorb essential concepts and subject specific vocabulary.   
         Technology used for ELLs include smartboard slides with visual support, Imagine Learning software with native language 
support, ESL Brain Pop, Ipads with apps to support ELL language development and IREADY.    
    To ensure that ELL-SWD students receive all services on their IEP, IEPs are reviewed by our Special Education supervisor 
Myron Hacken as well as the classroom teachers who have the students to look at the services the students have.  Service 
providers are given lists of students who they will have to serve with the appropriate service and schedules are 
created.  Attendance is tracked on SESIS as well.  
 To ensure that ELL-SWD students whose IEP mandates that they receive ENL services, ENL teachers Michele D'Amato and 
Cynthia Luck review students IEPs and the rlat report with IEP students NYSESLAT/NYSITEll levels.  Programs are created in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

 

consultation with other service providers of these students so there are no conflicts.  If a child has a bilingual program on their 
IEP, an alternate placement para is hired and assigned to this child who speaks the child's native language.   
     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
     In order to meet the needs of our diverse ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency, ELL-SWDs are 
integrated into appropriate ELL groups based on their grade level and proficiency level.  This might have the students either 
work within their appropriate classroom setting with an ENL teacher for the mandated number of minutes based on their 
proficiency level and IEP or travel to another class to work with an ENL teacher and another group of ENL students.  Whenever 
possible, the ENL teacher tries to limit the number of pull outs for ELL-SWDs because they are being provided other related 
services that take them out of the classroom.  The classroom teacher and ENL teacher collaborate in order to make the 
necessary modifications for ELL-SWDs in order for them to meet their IEP goals and attain English proficiency.    A bilingual 
para professional will accompany ELL-SWDs as indicated on their IEP to provide Native Language support as necessary.          
    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
     Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA and Math are offered through our Title III program. This program targets 
Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning students to help further support their language acquisition skills and give them 
additional support in content area subjects. 
As we track ELL progress through the year, Tier III RTI services are available through our SETTS teacher Amanda Nizawitz and 
IEP teacher Alyssa Kazinski.  ELL students who are not making progress, even with classroom interventions ,are discussed by 
our Child Study Team after various Tier I and Tier II interventions have been implemented.  After a discussion by the child study 
team, a student will be placed in Tier III RTI services using a variety of different programs based on students needs such as 
Wilson, Explode the Code, guided reading and math.  These students are reviewed after a six week period to see if any 
progress is made.   Imagine Learning, a research based computer program for ELLs is used for our Entering and Emerging ELLs 
with Native language support in Chinese, Spanish, Urdu and Russian.  Students progress is tracked in different area such as 
phonics, vocabulary, and decoding, and reports are generated to track ELLs progress.    Classroom teachers and ELL teachers 
have access to LLI, a Literacy Intervention guided reading program which can be utilized to provide interventions for ELLs who 
are not reading on grade level.    
     For ELL students who require intervention services  in social studies curriculum,  the targeted interventions used are as 
follows: National Geographic leveled reading  kits and guided reading program which will support ELL students in 
understanding content at their reading level and provides visual vocabulary support.   In addition, social study vocabulary kits 
are used to expose students to the vocabulary needed  to comprehend curriculum.  For science, National Geographic text kits 
and guided reading books are used to support ELL students who are having difficulty comprehending science content.  These 
interventions are used for ELLs who are usually at the Emerging and Entering levels of ENL who are still developing their 
language skills and have difficulty understanding the content.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

      Based on the current data, ENL students are scoring better in speaking and listening skills versus reading and writing skills. 
In addition, based on the Fountas and PInnell  When examining writing assessments, although ENL students are writing, they 
are still struggling with sentence structure and grammatical skills.   ENL teachers will focus more on reading and writing skills 
when conducting small group instruction during integrated ENL.  Teachers will use guided reading instruction with targeted 
skills and vocabulary to help build students literacy skills.    In addition, classroom teachers in collaboration with ENL teachers 
will begin to use the Teachers College Writing program for the upcoming school year.  To further support ENL students, the 
Imagine Learning and IREADY programs were purchased and students began using them this past Spring.   
     Once the current NYSESLAT and ELA and Math scores are available in the fall, teachers and administrators will analyze it 
further to look for progress and areas of improvement.  Title III programs will be tailored based on these results to target 
instruction on the skills students need support in such as reading comprehension and vocabulary.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
      ELLs at P.S.165 Queens are afforded equal access to all school programs.  ELLs are invited to participate in these 
programs  by letters sent home in parents preferred language with a permission slip.  ELLs actively participate in our morning 
Test Sophistication Program,  our performing arts programs, our newly basketball team, and our peer mediation 
activities.   Supplemental services offered to our ELLs within the school day include RTI services provided by the SETTS teacher, 
peer tutoring, and Bilingual buddies to offer ELLs support in their native language and support their English language 
development.   A large number of ELLs participate in our performing arts program.  A number of ELLs participate in our school 
recreational programs and are active members of our school community.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The following instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs:  
*Imagine Learning Computer Program (for ENL students who are at the Entering,Emerging, Transitioning levels or who have 
not shown progress.) 
*Jolly Phonics 
*Word to word bilingual glossaries 
* Sundance - Comprehension Strategies Kits - Fiction and Nonfiction 
* National Geographic - Nonfiction Reading and Writing Workshops 
* Raz Kids 
* Ten Marks 
*Learning A-Z 
* Power Point slide shows 
* SMART Board 
* LLI Guided Reading program 
*Mondo guided reading kits 
* Native language trade books 
 *Brain-Pop 
* Imagine Learning 
*I-Ready Math and ELA 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

     Native language support is provided in our ENL Program at P.S. 165.   Newcomer ELLs are encouraged to write responses to 
literature in their native languages.  Bilingual staff interprets these responses.  High-interest bilingual trade books are available 
for ELLs to read, as are bilingual dictionaries.  Bilingual dictionary software is utilized.  Bilingual paraprofessionals deliver native 
language support to ELLs when mandated by their IEPs and when they are working in a classroom that has students whose 
native language they speak.  In addition, Imagine Learning provides native language support when ELL students are using this 
program to help enhance their literacy skills.  The GO-Math program provides a bilingual edition in Spanish to support native 
Spanish speakers.  
 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

     The resources and required services correspond to ELLs ages and grade levels by grouping ELL students based on their grade 
level and proficiency level when possible.  Grade level materials are used with ELLs  along with scaffolding techniques to 
provide different entry points for ELLs and providing access to grade level materials to support their English language 
development.  ENL teachers are using complex texts within students grade levels and providing language support to help ELL 
students comprehend these texts to meet the demands of the Common Core Standards.  ELL students have access to different 
types of picture dictionaries based on their grade level and native language texts and dictionaries to support them in the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
        In order for newly enrolled Ells to transition into their new environment, ENL teachers set up a buddy system for the 
beginning of the school year for newly enrolled students.  Students are assigned a teacher/paraprofessional who speaks their 
native language.  Students and their families are introduced to this person and students can go to this person for support or 
questions they might have.  The teacher/paraprofessional will stay in contact with the classroom teacher to support the 
student and monitor how they are adjusting to their new environment.   
     For new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year, school administration in collaboration with ENL teachers try to place 
newcomer students in classes where there are students or teachers/paraprofessional that speak their native 
language.  Teachers or Paraprofessionals who speaks the family's native language will contact the family and try to help them 
with any questions or concerns they have.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
     Our certified ENL teachers attend professional development workshops on a regular basis.   The strategies presented at 
these workshops are then “turnkeyed” during Inquiry team meetings or staff development workshops for all teachers of 
ELLs.  Each of our ENL teachers attends additional staff development workshops offered by DELLSS (Division of English 
Language Learners) or our  ELL Specialists at the QN FSC.   
       Professional development is provided at faculty conferences, grade conferences and during staff development days on 
Monday afternoons.   Portions of staff development days are devoted to ELL training .  Some of the focus of this staff 
development is dedicated to the Common Core Learning Standards and the Language Progressions for ELLs.  In addition,  a 
DELLSS Instructinal ELL Coach, Pauline Samartzis comes in to provide support to ENL teachers and classroom teachers on ENL 
strategies.  There is also a literacy staff developer Erik Lepis form Living LIteracy LLC  that comes in once a week to support 
teachers grades K-2  in guided reading strategies.  At this time, a tentative schedule of PDs is being compiled by our 
Professional Development team based on staff needs and staff surveys.  Some of the ELL topics will include Teachers College 
Writing with ELLs,  ELL strategies for Science and Social studies,  Guided Reading Strategies for ELL learners and Personalizing 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

 

Ready Gen for ELL Learners.  
     Professional development offered to teachers to supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Standards include 
district and school workshops on the Ready Gen curriculum, Teachers College Writing Units and Go Math.  These Common 
Core Aligned programs are used school wide and to give our ELLs access to these programs .Teacher teams work on the 
personalization of these programs to give scaffolds for our ELLs to engage actively in the curriculum with the support of ENL 
specialists and administrators. Grade level Literacy and Math leaders provide staff development on providing different entry 
points for different types of learners such as ELLs and the teams work together to create tools for the students to use to 
support their learning.   In addition, workshops offered by DELLS and the district with topics related to ELLs and the Common 
Core Standards are offered to teachers of ELLs. These professional development opportunities support teachers of ELLs in 
delivering common core aligned instruction by providing them with strategies  to help our students afford the same access to 
Common Core Curriculum as our other students.  
     In addition, many professional texts have been purchased for teachers to help them support ENL students as well as all 
students.   These texts are :Academic Conversations by Jeff Zwiers,  Literacy Continuum by: Fontas and Pinnell, Reading 
strategies book by: Jennifer Serravallo, Writing Strategies Book by: Jennifer Serravallo, Conferring with Readers by: Jennifer 
Serravallo, and Writing Strategies for Mathematics by: Trisha Brummer and Sarah Kartchner Clark.  Para Professionals who 
support ENL students are also reading professional texts and engaging in a "book club" Monday afternoons during professional 
development time to deepen their learning.   
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
     In order to meet the professional development requirements as per  CR Part 154.2:  a professional development plan has 
been developed by our Professional Development team.  The team has planned professional development that will address ELL 
topics based on the needs of our school.  This professional development will take place during professional development time 
on Monday from 240-4pm and will be conducted by our administrators, ENL teachers and district ENL coaches.  Agendas and 
attendance sheets will be kept in a professional development binder in the Assistant Principal's office.  Teachers will also keep 
copies of agendas for their own records. 
    To meet the mandates  for 50% of total hours  of Professional development for ENL teachers on ELL specific professional 
development , ENL teachers will be sent to professional development activities offered by DELLSS.  They will also attend district 
workshops on ELL specific topics as well as school professional development.  In addition, teachers will attend workshops 
offered by QN FSC.  Teachers will hand in agendas from workshops and they will be kept in a binder.  ENL teachers will also 
keep a copy of the agenda and track their number of hours and if they are meeting the mandate.     
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
     The school will provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss program goals, progress, language 
proficiency assessment results, and language development in content areas by ENL teachers making appointments with 
individual parents on Tuesday afternoons during parent engagement time.  Most of the time, these meetings with be with the 
classroom teacher and the ENL teacher. Translation services will be provided by staff members who speak the parents home 
language or the Language interpretation unit.  The ENL teacher will have a list of parents preferred language to plan for 
interpretation and translation needs of parents. 
    A tracking sheet will be kept for annual individual meetings with ELL parents with notes to document the outreach to ensure 
parents needs are met.  All communication will be noted on the tracking sheet and copies of letters sent home will be kept.  
    To track individual annual meetings for ELL parents, a tracking sheet is kept with students names and the dates of all annual

ELL parent meetings are kept as well as phone conferences.   The tracking sheet will be kept in the ENL/ESL compliance binder.  
 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

PS 165Q Parental Involvement Policy 
     The PS 165Q Parent Involvement Policy recognizes that “parents are our partners” in the education of our children. With 
the primary goal of building strong parent involvement in our school, we encourage all parents to become active participants 
in the educational process and invite them to participate in a variety of parent workshops and activities both at the school and 
district level.  The PS 165Q Parent Involvement Policy is inclusive of requirements set forth by the New York City Department 
of Education.  This Policy is also aligned with New York City and New York State requirements for English Language Learners 
(ELLs), potential ELLs and Special Education students. All Parental Involvement is consistent with Section 1118 of the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Examples of opportunities for parent involvement, based on these laws and 
policies are listed below. 
 
TRANSLATION SERVICES AVAILABLE 
     For written translation of important school documents, P.S.165 uses the  NYCDOE Translation and Interpretation Unit to 
provide translations in seven DOE-recognized languages.  We have translations made in Chinese, Spanish, Russian, Urdu, 
Korean, Arabic and Bengali.  For oral translations we request the services of bilingual paraprofessionals, teachers and parent 
volunteers (Bilingual Buddies) who assist non-English speaking parents.  We make use of these staff members during Parent 
Teacher conferences and other important school meetings (i.e. IEP meetings) and activities.  Bilingual Buddies and 
paraprofessionals also translate at parent workshops and meetings upon parental request. 
We also assist parents in need of translation through the DOE Translation Unit by Phone.  They offer many additional 
languages and can conference with the teacher/administrator with the parent from their offices. 
 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENT INVOLVEMENT AT PS 165Q 
SCHOOL BASED ACTIVITIES 
     Schools receive technical assistance from the Office of Family Engagement (OFEA), Queens Borough Director and the District 
Family Advocates, in designing parent activities.  School Guidance Counselors, the Youth Development Coordinator and the 
Parent Coordinator have received extensive training to effectively implement parent activities and workshops, based on the 
needs of our school community.  All of these programs are designed to build and nurture strong parental involvement.  
 
Parent/Teacher Association (PTA) Activities 
     The Parent Teacher Association (PTA) invites all interested parents to join them in the activities that they sponsor. These 
activities include regularly scheduled informational meetings and workshops.  In addition, the PTA works with school staff to 
implement special events for students (i.e. special assemblies and professional performances).  They publish a Quarterly 
Newsletter, “The Voice”, and distribute informational flyers and brochures on a regular basis.  These newsletters and flyers 
help to keep parents informed about school events as well as opportunities to become more involved in school 
activities.  There are monthly General Membership Meetings where Parents can receive all current information about School 
Policy and Programs as well as updated calendars of events.  The PTA, in collaboration with the Parent Coordinator, present 
special programs, workshops or speakers at each of these meetings to ensure renewed parent interest in their children’s 
Health, Safety and Education.  
Parent/Teacher Conferences and Meet the Teacher. 
     Parent/Teacher Conferences are held three times yearly in the fall and in the spring at PS 165Q. Conferences can be 
scheduled before, during and after the school day to accommodate parents’ schedules.  Notices of when these conferences 
are held will be sent home with students.  At these conferences, parents will have the opportunity to meet with classroom 
teachers as well as school-based teacher specialists (e.g. ENL teacher, SETTS teacher). School Counselors, Therapists and Staff 
are also available to assist Parents.  In the fall, “Open School Week” is held, the week after P/T Conferences.  Parents have an 
opportunity to visit their child’s classrooms and observe the daily teaching methods and routines. 
     In addition, our school hosts “Meet the Teacher” evening each September.  These meetings are designed so that parents 
can learn about the curriculum, classroom rules and students’ requirements. Translation and interpretation services are 
available at this time through our parent bilingual buddies and staff members.   Although parents will not have the opportunity

to meet individually with their child’s teacher at this time, these meetings provide a valuable opportunity to hear about what 
students will be learning during the year, discuss ways parents can help students at home, and familiarize parents with the 
educational program.  Coupled with Parent/Teacher Conferences, “Meet the Teacher” Meetings give parents a broad 
understanding of what their child’s school year will be like. 
 
 
Pre- K and Kindergarten Orientation 
 PS 165Q hosts a Pre-K/Kindergarten Orientation Meeting for the parents of incoming students and their families.  The 
Orientation is held in late spring, as well as the first day of the new school year, and gives families an exciting preview of their 
children’s’ first years in school. 
 
Curriculum Fairs, Musical Performances, School Plays 
PS 165Q sponsors many musical and curriculum-based presentations which provide an opportunity for parents to experience, 
first hand, the kinds of educational activities their children are taking part in.  These events include: Winter and Spring Glee 
Club, Dance Club and Band Concerts, a school-wide Dance Festival, Multicultural night, Dr.Seuss Reading under the stars, and 
Math night. There are also enrichment programs for all students on every grade including Hip Hop Hamilton, Lion King theater, 
and Tae Kwon Do. Parents are invited to attend performances at the culmination of these programs for their children.  These 
special programs are an excellent way for parents to gain a richer understanding of the well-rounded educational 
opportunities at PS 165Q.   
                              
School Leadership Team (SLT) 
Our parents are actively involved as members of the School Leadership Team.  As per the Chancellor’s mandate, and in 
accordance with Section 100.11, parents comprise half the members of the team.                               
Through membership on the SLT, parents have opportunity for planning and evaluating school programs and procedures, 
including this School‘s Parent Involvement policy. 
 
English Language Learner (ELL) Parent Orientations 
Annual parent orientations are held for parents of ELLs and potential ELLs, as specified in New York City Department of 
Education requirements.  These orientations are provided so that parents can make informed choices about programs for their 
children.  Ongoing ENL Classes for adults (“Crossroads Café”) provide opportunities for our Parents to improve their own 
Reading, Writing and Oral Communication skills in the English Language and to become more proactive in assisting their 
children with their educational challenges. 
 
School Committees 
Opportunities exist for parents to sit as members of various school committees through participation in the PTA, membership 
on the School Leadership Team or as needed for school-wide purposes.  These committees include: Safety Committee, Health 
Committee, CEP Writing Committee and Fundraising Committee.  In addition, some committees are formed for special 
circumstances like Grant Writing or Special Event Planning Committees.  Parents are valued members of these project planning 
committees as well. 
 
School Sponsored Parent Workshops and Classes 
     PS 165Q provides many opportunities for parent participation by offering parent workshops on a wide variety of topics 
including: Parenting Skills, Communicating Effectively with Children, Homework Help, Keeping our Kids Safe, Testing and 
Curriculum, Learning through Technology, Nutrition and Fitness, Understanding Core Curriculum.  In addition, our school offers 
ongoing ENL classes for adults(Crossroads Café).  We are constantly looking for new ways to include Parents from every culture 
as well as those Parents of Special Needs Children and Non-English Speaking Parents. We make sure that parents are 
communicated to in a multitude of languages and try to provide translators for the most important meetings and events. We 
aim to schedule these workshops and classes at convenient times to accommodate parents’ schedules. These workshops and 
classes are facilitated and led by the Parent Coordinator, Counselors and Administrators as well as many teachers in the 
building.

Other School Based Activities 
      A wide variety of additional opportunities for parent involvement exist at the school level including telephone 
contacts,  Parent Breakfasts with our Principal, guest speakers, translators(Bi-Lingual Buddies), trips, assemblies, school 
newsletters, and classroom writing celebrations.   
Our Parent Information Center, just inside our front door, has been a tremendous success.  Parents can learn about activities 
going on in the school and surrounding community and pick up information (flyers, brochures, arts calendars, etc.) that 
encourages Parental Involvement as well as educational and recreational opportunities for our families.  
 
     All of these activities, workshops, meetings, and programs provide parents with many opportunities to learn about the 
education and enrichment of their children and participate in their children's educational success.   
                                                                                                         
 
 
 
       
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Tiffany-Davis Nealy, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use two major sources of data to access the translation and interpretation needs of our school. First, we use 
the preferred language list in ATS to make sure parents receive documents and communications in appropriate 
languages. Secondly, we keep a list of our students receiving ENL and send home communications that mirror the 
home language as well. A parent survey is sent home to assess language needs as well. In addition, we poll our 
parents at PTA meetings for feedback on documents we have translated and simplify or modify these documents 
as needed. Finally, parents request written or oral translations from us throughout the year, including translation 
requests for Parent/Teacher conferences.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

provide interpretation service(s)?  

To provide interpretation services, 
para professionals who speak many of 
the parents preferred languages will 
sit on on meet the teacher sessions to 
support parents. In addition, there are 
many parents who speak preferred 
languages of school parents and 
buddy up with a parent in the class to 
help them during these meetings.  

 

Parents indicate on parent/teacher 
conference note if they are in need of 
a translator during conferences. The 
parent coordinator has a translation 
binder in which a teacher can request 
a translator for a parent during a 
conference time. Our para 
professionals who speak preferred 
languages or parent bilingual buddies 
are assigned conference times to 
attend to support these parents.  

 

Interpretation services are provided 
for parents at these meeting by staff 
members who speak preferred 
languages, orientation videos in 
preferred languages for parents and 
translated language forms. The 
language and interpretation unit will 
be called in case there is a language 
we have no available language for.  

 

When parents come in to meet with 
teachers during parent engagement 
time, staff members who speak 
parents preferred languages provide 
translation services as well as calling 
the translation unit in case there is

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

A communication strategy to reach limited-English proficient families in the event of a school emergency is to send an 
automated call which is available in translated languages. For languages not available, a staff member who speaks the 
parents preferred language will call home or get a assistance from the translation unit.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

In order to ensure that the staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor's Regulation A-663, teachers are made 
aware of the goal of the regulation for all parents to be active participants in their child's education and have access 
to translation services in order to do this. The LAC, Ms. Trina Jacobs distributes informational packets in the beginning 
of the school year to teachers which has information about translation services available to parents with the phone

number for the translation unit. In addition, teachers also receive laminated cards for parents to be able to identify 
their home language so a teacher can identify a parents language needs.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In order to fulfill the notification requirements for translation and interpretation services as per Section VII of 
Chancellor's Regulation A-663, a welcome poster is prominently posted at the entrance of our school building for our 
parents to see. The security desk and office staff have language ID guides so parents can identify their preferred 
language. At the beginning of the school year, parents are given the parents bill of rights and parents guide to 
language access so parents are fully aware of their right to translation services and how they can make their needs 
known.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The NYC parent Survey will provide feedback to our school about the quality and availability of services. The parent 
coordinator also ask for feedback from parents during one one one meetings and other workshops about our 
translation services. To improve these services, support has been put in place to identify parents language needs on 
important notices such as parent teacher conference notes so teachers can arrange for translation during important 
meetings.  

In addition, parents of different cultures and language needs will participate in different focus groups to provide 
feedback on our translation services and help us construct best practices to communicate with families. These focus 
groups can be conducted at the conclusion of a school workshop or meeting to help us get some feedback.
