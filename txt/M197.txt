Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          6 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is to is to reach, challenge and motivate each student by helping them use inquiry and problem-solving as 
effective methods to approach learning and other lifelong experiences. We will provide a safe and academically 
enriched environment that fosters excellence. To help us accomplish these efforts, we will promote collaboration 
among the family, the school and the community. Our school community’s strength lies in our culture of collaboration 
amongst students, families, teachers, administrators, and community partnering organizations.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Three of our major community-based partners are Harlem Children’s Zone, Harlem Grown, and Time-In Art. Our 
school has experienced significant gains in progress in student achievement, as well as significant gains in the level of 
approval of families and staff members in the quality of educational experiences being provided to our students. A 
challenge that continues to confront our school is the amount of students who live in transient temporary housing 
and the effect that their circumstances have on both the academic and emotional progress of them as well as their 
peers. Another constant challenge is the limited amount of resources available through conventional means.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

John B. Russwurm Elementary School is comprised of 300 students from 3K through grade 5. The school population 
consists of 70% Black, 25% Hispanic, 5% White and 0% Asian students. The student body includes 10% English 
language learners and 33% special education students. Boys account for 60% of the students enrolled and girls 
account for 40%.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Two elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which we have made great strides are establishing and 
sustaining a Supportive Environment , as well as Strong Family and Community Ties . Students are made to feel 
academically safe, as well as emotionally safe. Teachers are willing to take risks through introducing new and 
innovative ideas to support students. Families feel at home in our school. One sub group of students that we will 
continue to provide additional supports to are our Students With Disabilities. While action plans outlined in the 2018-
19 SCEP supported our school with achieving positive increases in all elements of the Framework, we continue to seek 
ways to improve the quality of instruction and collaborative culture. For the 2017-18 school year, we will focus on 
Rigorous Instruction and Collaboration among Teachers .

protocols for examining student work. Teacher Teams will be 
reorganized to examine particular subgroups of students. 

Programs will be developed to target the specific needs of 
subgroups of students such as: After School Common Core 
Readiness learning groups, Saturday Academy, and One-to-One 
tutoring. The Response to Intervention (RTI) Team will be refined 
to support teachers with strategies for reaching all students. The 
Team will provide sample activities for each tier level. 
Additionally, team members will analyze data and monitor the 
progress of students in order to track progress of students 
school-wide. 

Provide information, materials and training for parents on the 
CCLS in literacy at monthly parental involvement discussion 
groups. Provide parents with information and training (Engage 
NY, NYC School Accounts, etc.) to foster a caring and effective 
home-school partnership ensuring that parents can effectively 
support and monitor their child’s progress. Provide parents with 
their child’s Benchmark Reading Level Progress Report 3x per 
year to keep them updated and informed of student growth. 
Through various forums, teachers and parents will have the 
opportunity to engage in collaborative conversations with 
administrators to discuss progress of students, success of 
programs, and ideas that could potentially enhance our school 
community.

children can rely on for support. Also, our most recent Quality Review indicates the following: “The school has a 
structure in place to ensure students are well-known by the school community and to promote the adoption of 
effective academic and personal behaviors.” A growing concern that our school community does have is our 
attendance rate, which directly impacts our students’ academic progress. Our student attendance rate for last 
school year was 89.3%.

Focused peer learning walks will be scheduled for identified 
teachers to observe each others practices resulting in 
collaborative sessions in which teachers discuss problems of 
practice. Teachers will then work to create a focused plan of 
action to resolve the problem of practice and increase 
student achievement.  
All teachers will engage in learning walks at schools identified 
as implementing best instructional practices – particularly in 
planning and preparation. 

Administrators will create a trend analysis from observation 
feedback to determine which areas of instruction need 
prioritizing and to create cohorts of teachers to address their 
specific needs. 
Data meeting will be held with teachers once per semester to 
discuss the progress of individual students and subgroups of 
students. 

Teachers and paraprofessionals will be expected to host a 
minimum of two family workshops in which teachers address 
how they support the needs of all learners. Teachers will be 
required to share in monthly newsletters curriculum 
overviews.  
During School Leadership Team meetings, parents will have 
the opportunity to ask questions pertaining to instructional 
practices.  

Principal and Assistant principal will meet with teachers three 
times per year one-on-one to address successes, questions, 
and/or concerns with regard to their progress of pedagogy.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Researchers, policymakers, and education leaders agree that teacher quality is a vital factor in improving student 
achievement. Therefore, it is imperative that we at PS 197M recruit, develop, and retain high-quality teachers to 
ensure that all children are provided with an adequate education. Each year, we establish a hiring team that 
collaborates to recruit, hire, and sustain teachers that have the potential to meet our standards. 
To ensure that teachers are adequately prepared, PS 197M has formed partnerships with local teacher preparation 
programs 
- City College, TOURO College, Teachers College at Columbia University, and Bank Street. We advocate that specific 
needs—such as working with students with different learning abilities or learning effective classroom management 
strategies—be addressed while future teachers are enrolled in school. Teaching interns from these learning 
institutions are then invited to engage in their residencies at our school. It is also through these partnerships that we 
provide adequate support and preparation to specific groups of teachers. New teachers are sent to professional 
development series that address topics relevant to 21 st century learning. 
The District 5 Team and the Manhattan Borough Field Office personnel supports us with the development of our 
teachers. They work with our administrative team each year to create a thoughtful professional development plan 
based on the needs of our students. Teachers attend monthly sessions designed to address the instructional 
expectations of the city and/or state. They also attend weekly sessions customized for their specific needs as it relates 
to instructional practices. School visits are conducted with teachers in which they are observed and are provided with 
immediate feedback and an individualized support plan. Progress monitoring ensures that teachers are professionally 
growing at a pace that will ensure that their performance is up to our high standards. 
When making assignment decisions for teachers, the demographics of the class as a whole, the learning style of the 
students, and the current skill-set of the teacher are taking into consideration. All new teachers are assigned a mentor 
colleague and an administrative mentor. Administrators work with mentors to observe mentees and provide feedback 
and time-bound next steps using a research-based teacher effectiveness rubric. Based on the goals that new teachers 
set at the onset of the school year, the effectiveness of the support given is analyzed and an adjustment is made 
accordingly. 
Evidence continues to mount that teacher working conditions directly affect the success or failure of efforts to 
adequately staff schools with demographics such as that of PS 197M. In order to ensure that our school community is 
equipped to provide an environment in which new teachers can thrive and cultivate a desire to remain a member of 
our school community, we aim to maintain a collegial staff with a shared teaching philosophy and adequate resources 
necessary to teach. In addition, we are striving to build a supportive and active parent community. 
When making assignment decisions for teachers, the demographics of the class as a whole, the learning style of the 
students, and the current skill-set of the teacher are taking into consideration.

The “Literacy in the Common Core Classroom” series will explore best pedagogical practices employed inside 
the literacy classroom anchored in the Danielson Framework. Sessions will focus on the Citywide Instructional 
Expectations and embedding the instructional shifts into teacher practice. As a cohort, lead teachers will learn 
to strengthen their practices study as well as lead teacher teams back at their schools. 
● NYCDOE Teacher Effectiveness Coach Sessions 
School leaders and teachers will engage in this ongoing cycle within the greater context of our school’s PD 
cycles of professional learning. These cycles of observation, feedback, support, and professional learning are 
grounded in the Danielson Rubric.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
3K, 4K, and Kindergarten teachers serve together on a vertical articulation team. During their sessions, the focus is on 
analyzing student work at the Kindergarten level and refining academic activities and instructional practices to 
improve foundational skills. Teachers focus on Common Core aligned performance tasks that require students to 
apply sophisticated skills. Simultaneously, the Pre-kindergarten teachers analyze results from administered Common 
Core tasks and determine what skills are necessary to focus on so that students entering kindergarten have the 
necessary prerequisite skills to successfully master standards at the kindergarten level. At the start of the final school 
semester (March), Kindergarten teachers instruct pre-kindergarten students for 30 minutes, two times per week.

Parent workshops conducted by the school’s early childhood psychologist focus on transitioning to elementary school. 
Kindergarten teachers facilitate activities for parents to participate in and they present expectations for Kindergarten 
students. Additionally, community Day Care Centers and Head start programs are invited to bring their classes to our 
school for open house. The school psychologist, in conjunction with the School-Based support team conduct 
observations for students zoned to our school that have been identified as needing support services. Parents of these 
students are introduced to the various service providers who with our students. Our family worker retrieves and 
maintains all records for incoming students adhering to the calendar created by our school 
 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
A Teacher Cabinet consisting of one teacher from each grade was constructed for the purpose of collaborating with 
administrators to select, assess, analyze and refine the curriculum, assessments and other supplementary programs. 
The Cabinet went through a series of professional development sessions in which they were guided through mock 
sessions of conducting teacher team meetings. They learned various protocols they could potentially use to structure 
looking at student work and formative assessment data. Once per month the Teacher Cabinet meets with the 
Administrative Cabinet to review student progress towards interim benchmarks and to collectively decide if 
implementation of the curriculum and assessments are successful or whether or not adjustments need to be made 
with the goal of continuously improvement student achievement. 
 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. [School name], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act PS197M is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

PS 197M will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community; 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSAState 
accountability system, student proficiency levels,Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey 
Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the Elementary and Secondary ACT (ESSA; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;

a format, and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS 197M, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
PS 197 students are assessed with School Net-Periodic Assessment, STARS Readiing,  Fountas and Pinnel Running Records, 
teacher-created assessments, and observation data to determine  ENLs language development. Additional assessment 
tools  will be reviewed and  used  this year to generate an intervention tool in the lower grades that will facilitate  to assess 
early literacy skills.This data will  also help determine  instructional goals for ENLs, and support the ENL teacher 
in  creating  individual goals for each  ENL student based on the child's  language and proficiency level 
needs,  offering  targeted support support in strenthening English oral and literacy skills, and support our school  in 
differentiating instruction where tier I RTI services could begin in the classroom focusing on the identified areas of need. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Data Cycles and schedules for analysis are established at the beginning of the school year.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success for our Ells is  based on how well these students met AYP for ENLs on their state measures of ELA and Math. As part of 
our school's CEP,  the  goal is for all our students  to  improve in  English Language Arts achievement outcomes, with a 
particular focus on English Language Learners, Students with Disabilities and bottom 1/3 students to close the achievement 
gaps of these sub-groups.          
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The school uses three research-based programs:  1) Fundations, 2) Wilson, and 3)  LLI. After identifying stent trends, students 
are grouped based on their needs.  Students receive intervention in 6 week cycles.  Students receive intervention during the 
school-side independent reading block.  They are pulled out or the RTI teacher pushes into the classroom.  Data is analyzed at 
the end of each cycle to identify if students have made progress. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school utilizes our universal screening tool -Fountas and Pinnel Reading Assessment to guide instruction for ENLs within 
the Response to Intervnetion Framework as well as teacher data gathered during tier I intervention. This data is used to group 
students accordingly for tier II intervention. Students are then offered intervention in areas such as decoding, word work, sight 
word development, vocabulary, cueing systmes, and comprehension. Students are grouped according to these needs and 
provided direct Tier II instruction in the identified areas by  Ms. Anderson-RTI  teacher and Ms. Fonseca- ENL teacher. All 
second and third grade ENL students have also been targetted for our Title III after school program which is an addition to 
their tier II services also targeting areas of deficiencies. It is expected that with these supports they will be able to perform at 
grade level standards on state wide exams. During our day to day literacy block, ENL's are consistently progressed monitored. 
Instruction is then modified providing them with tier I scaffolded instruction which is differentiated specifically for ENL 
students. Once teachers have done assessments, they develop an individualized instructions and support.  One type of 
instruction done in each classroom is small groups.  Within these small groups, the teachers meet with their students and work 
on a variety of skills such as phonemic awareness, decoding skills, and comprehension skills which are differentiated based on 
the students' needs.  A second support that is done within the classrooms is that teachers introduce vocabulary words with 
tier 1, 2 and 3.  Our Ready Gen literacy curriculum, writing, Go Math and other content areas provide tier work in all three 
levels to promote language development.  Lastly, the tools used to guide instructions are as follows: ELA, Math State Exam, 
whole group rigorous curriculum throughout the content areas, small groups, differentiated instruction, teachers aligning the 
Common Core Learning Standards to the curriculum, running records, Fundations and teacher conferencing that are used to 
guide instruction, monitoring of individual and support which are ongoing.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 THE NYSITELL and NYSESLAT  data results revealed the following pattern trends: Grades K and 1 results  indicate  that ELLS are 
performing at the lowest  proficiency  levels . When examining pattern trends in grades 2-5, the data  indicates that most 
students do well  on the speaking and listening components of language  but are  struggling in the reading and writing 
components of the NYSESLAT test.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Data is analyzed by school leaders and the Instructional Cabinet and disseminated to teachers.  Teachers ensure during 
common planning that lessons must be differentiated to target students' needs.  Teachers create a variety of tiered questions 
where students are engaged in focused conversations.  This process allows the ENL students to have opportunities to practice 
the new language.  In addition, teachers ensure that students are being challenged while preparing them for the next 
level.  Teachers also use the Depth of Knowledge Matrix as a guide to generate questions.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

acquisition 
1a.    Instruction is delivered using ENL methodology and strategies,  addressing  the four modalities of language 
acquisition; Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing. Scaffolding is also provided to ensure that content is 
comprehensible and learning takes place. In recognition of varying skills, language proficiency and learning styles, we 
differentiate instruction for our ENLs. Different instructional strategies are modified for our ENLs including: Direct 
Instruction; Inquiry-Based Learning; Cooperative Learning; Information Processing, the Ready Gen Program to foster 
literacy independence. Based on our growing number of needs for our ELLS, students will  receive ENL instruction 
during the school day via a Free-Standing ENL (Pull-Out, Push-In) program  model for  grades K-5  using the Sheltered 
Instruction Observation Protocol   ( SIOP ) model  to facilitate language proficiency and strengthen language 
acquisition.In the Free-Standing ENL Program (K-5th Grade) instruction is delivered according to the mandated 
number of instructional minutes. As per CR Part 154.2 , students receive the following services:       1) Beginners =2 
units of ENL (360 minutes) per week 2) Intermediate =2 units of ENL (360 minutes) per week 3) Advanced =1 unit ENL 
(180 minutes) per week, plus 1Unit ELA (180 minutes) per week. Using all the prescribed methodology, the teacher 
differentiates instruction for the students according to their performance on the NYSESLAT and their individual 
needs.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           #2a. Organization of our staff ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to the 
proficiency            
         levels in our ENL classes. The schedule of our ENL students is provided to our principal who approves it.  In compliance 
with the CR Part 154.2, all our students depending on their proficiency level receive 180 minutes to 360 minutes a week of 
ENL.  All Entering and Emerging students 360 minutes of ENL instruction per week and Transitioning and Expanding receive 
180 minutes and the Commanding receive 90 minutes. Students are grouped by language fluency within age parameters.  The 
program serves all students with limited proficiency (LEP) until they achieve proficiency in the English language.  All ENLs 
receive five periods of ENL every day 450 minutes.  Five periods of 45 minutes of Social Studies and Science per 
week.  Technology, two periods of 45 minutes per week.  Gymnasium, one period of 45 minutes per week.  Gymnasium classes 
are also attended by most students twice a week.  Health classes, one period of 45 minutes a week according to the 
grade.  Note:  P.S. 197 does not have courses taught in languages other than English.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 
Core content is delivered in each program model through the  workshop model format. Teachers model the intended skill, 
students try out the skill, and the students  get a chance to discuss what they learned. Students then go back to their tables for 
independent time. During this time the students read, write, work on math problems, or work in centers during  science 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

exploration time. (Depending on the content) The teacher then confers with a group of student (s), to work on decoding skills, 
writing skills, phonemic awareness skill, etc... Students are then asked to share what they worked on during independent time. 
The classroom environment is set up where each content area bulletin has vocabulary words with a definition  and a picture 
card. 
The curriculum used in the school is ReadyGen, Go Math, Science Foss,  we use  Scope and Sequence for Science and Social 
Studies. These programs are all in alignment with the Common Core Learning Standards.  
 
The program includes appropriate strategies to accommodate the needs of our ENLs as follows: - Total Physical Response, 
Language Experience Approach, Whole Language, The Natural Approach, Cooperative Learning, Differentiated Instruction, 
Scaffolding,  repetition, graphic organizers, inter-active read-aloud, shared and guided reading.  It also includes writing, 
retelling, sequencing, how to, picture/sound, role playing, gestures, modeling, language development through the content 
areas  meet the demands of the Common Core Standards.  
  
English Language Arts Area 
 -       Based on the Freestanding English as a New Language Model core content is delivered to equally facilitate language and 
academic development in two languages.  This is done in order to acknowledge the native languages of the students; to foster 
positive self-concepts and images as will as aide all the students in understanding other cultures. 
  
-      The goal of the content base integrated approach to learning in the classroom is for the students to acquisition of English 
and their grade level academics so that the ENL students can succeed in an English -only classroom.  
-       In order to facilitate such a learning environment all instruction is done in English to immerse the student in academic and 
core content language .  When possible, the child's primary language is used to clarify instructions or misconceptions. 
-       The acquisition of English takes place in a structured non-threatening environment in which students feel comfortable 
taking risks.  
-       Students are taught to say "I don't understand," "Slower," Please Repeat." 
-       One word answers are accepted, drawing with labels. 
-       Some language buddies. 
-       Allowing students to share and show ideas with classmates allows them to hear English, practice it, by speaking and 
listening to their peers. 
-       Lessons include controlled vocabulary while students gradually acquire the necessary language skills to succeed 
academically. 
  
Mathematics Content Area 
In order to assist our students in both academic achievement and assessment, there is a variety of solutions that we are 
working with this year.  They embrace the following: 
-       Analyse ENLs' data to become well-informed about the performance of each ENL in order to make sound educational 
decisions. 
-       Provide opportunities for students to negotiate with mathematics academic language, e.g., reading and solving word 
problems, interactive word wall.  
-       Incorporate writing as a component to the mathematics lesson, e.g., journals. 
-       Provide opportunities to convey to others problem solving strategies and the justification to their answer. 
-       Ensure the identification and analysis of student's strengths and weakness to drive and differentiate instruction. 
-       Collaborate between content area and ENL teachers to map out student specific needs. 
-       Encourage math teachers to participate in professional development opportunities focusing on ENL instructional needs, 
such as, Quality teaching for English Learners and Community Learning Support Organization.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    To ensure that ENLs are appropriately evaluated in their in their native languages throughout the year we provide 
translation services.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

#6a. Our instructional plan for a student with interrupted formal education or SIFE may include working in a small group within 
the classroom with the classroom teacher and  receiving intervention services such as AIS and RTI and participating in a Title III 
after school program or Saturday Academy .  
6b.An ENL student who has less than three years of school receive instruction in English.  We  also provide an academic after-
school program in reading and math to further assist students in the areas of need. We are fortunate to have Harlem Grown 
Volunteers to  assist by providing  instructional support.  
6c. ENL students receiving services for 4 to 6 years are provided continued support in our ENL program. These students are 
also identified for our RTI program with a clear instructional focus according to assessment data. Upon mastery of targeted 
areas other areas are identified to continue providing the support.  
6d. Our school does not have any ENL students in need of a long term plan. In case the need should arise our plan is to provide 
them with Academic Intervention Services for a block of 45 minutes on a daily basis. In addition, these students would be 
invited to attend our instructional after school program and our extended day 150 minute a week program.  
6e: Former ENL students they continue to receive support via strategy lessons, guided reading, small group instruction and 
one-on-one conferences with their classroom teachers. If the need is great they also receive support from the AIS provider and 
may also be recommended to continue receiving ENL at risk services.  
For former ENL who have tested out of program for one year continue to receive the extended time.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
All ENLs identified as having special needs receive their mandated ENL service and accommodations that are mandated by the 
IEP.  ENL teacher works closely with the Special Education teachers to ensure ELL-SWD's improvement and address their 
needs.  The ENL teacher uses a variety of instructional strategies and grade level materials for ENL-SWDs that both provide 
access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development. the ENL teacher utilizes visual aids, role-
playing cooperative work, picture books, drama and role playing, technology, manipulatives, read-alouds, etc.  ENL strategies 
and instructional methods are utilized.  The students use the same instructional material provided to ENL services. 
  
ENL-SWDs utilize the same instructional materials provided to ENL service,  as follows: 
- Scholastic Reading Skills Kit, Level B-C 
- Readers theater - Grades K to 5 
- Comprehension Skills Library, Levels A to F 
- Into English, Levels A to G 
- Whole Language Big Book Program, Levels A-B-C 
- Language Handbook, Levels A-G 
- Vocabulary Connection - A Content Area Approach, Levels A to G 
- New Connections to English- Grade 3 
- Word Forward - Grades 3 & 4

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ENL teacher works in collaboration with Special Education teachers and other service providers ot coordinate curricular 
instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ENL-SWDs.  These students ae integrated in the main 
stream ENL program and put under the supervision of the teacher. The  RTI  teacher meets weekly to review the progress of 
individual students.  Based on formative assessment results, students are informally placed ICT classes for teacher-
recommended content areas for 6 weeks.  If the student progresses within the 6 weeks, they are given a formal flexible 
schedule.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
At P.S. 197, all services provided to ELLs are in English. We utilize data, teacher observation, student work samples and teacher 
articulation to be able to target instruction to the ELLs needs.  ELL students only receive targeted intervention if the data 
indicates they are in need of the additional services. Students in grades Kindergarten thru third grade are supported via our RTI 
extended day program and in small group tier 1 instruction within their classroom setting.  Mathematics intervention is also 
provided based on pre assessment unit data for students in grades 2nd through 5th grade. Both of these intervention 
programs are delivered in English.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 Increase the number of workshops and seminars attended by the ENL teacher,  primary classroom teachers and cluster 
teachers regarding strategies and best practices for instructing ENL students. Also provide Jose P training to staff to 
strengthen  best practices and research articles focusing on English as a Second Language  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Testing accommodations for ENLs are discontinued 2 years after a child tests at a proficient level on the NYSESLAT exam in 
accordance with the New York State Memo and the New York State Administrator's Manuel and Guideline.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
At Ps. 197M,  our ENLs are an active part of our inclusive  community where they  have access to all our instructional and 
recreational services being offered,  including extended day classes, art program, gardening, sports program, cook shop 
classes, and the student activities. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our school utilizes a variety of instructional materials and technology to support language development of all ENLs at all 
levels.  Their instructional materials are:

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We do not have a Dual-Language program at PS 197M.For our Spanish speakers newcomers, Mr. Kelly- our certified ENL 
teacher who is b-lingual , uses the native language as a support (as per the CR 154 regulations, 25% of the time). For the other 
newcomers who speak other languages,  all instruction is delivered in English, using ESL strategies to ensure comprehension. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 ELLs entitled to ENL service are placed in monolingual classrooms according to their ages and grade levels.  These students 
receive ENL instruction according to their English proficiency levels, age and grade levels.  ELLs acquire and develop English 
language while meeting their grade and age level standards in core subjects.  ELLs are assessed on an ongoing basis with the 
help of Fountas and Pinnel, NYS Testing and accountability reporting tool (NYSTART) in ELA and math data to drive teaching 
goals in instruction.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school utilizes a variety of instructional materials and technology to support language development of all ELLs at all 
levels.  Their instructional materials are:
