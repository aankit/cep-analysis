Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 65’s vision statement is as follows:  

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The Raymond York Elementary School strives to provide a secure, nurturing environment for learning, wherein all 
student abilities and learning styles are addressed. We believe that children learn differently, and that students 
should be respected and valued so that they may reach their full potential, and leave us with confidence in their 
abilities. We foster the whole child through the positive models we present them each day.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

As a Community Learning School, we know that education is a product of the combined efforts of parents, students, 
staff, and community. Together, we share a strong commitment to move all students forward. Enduring relationships 
forged between PS 65 and the community will give our students the resources they need to become productive 
members of their communities and responsible citizens of the world. The enthusiasm and inspired love of learning 
that we instill in our children will enable them to become valuable contributors to our global society as life-long 
learners, critical thinkers and problem solvers. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Raymond York is a K-5 elementary school housed in a leased building located in an industrial section of South Ozone 
Park, Queens. P.S. 65, The Raymond York School has 452 students from kindergarten through grade 5. The school 
population comprises 6% Black, 45% Hispanic, 4% White, 34% Asian, and 11% other students. The student body 
includes 9% English language learners and 9% special education students. Boys account for 50% of the students 
enrolled and girls account for 50%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 school year is 
currently 95.5%..  

PS 65 was renamed The Raymond York School in 2003 in honor of a 20 year New York Fire Department veteran who 
tragically died on duty from the World Trade Center attacks. Every year, PS 65 celebrates Raymond York’s legacy by 
having a “Ray Day” community event. 

PS 65 was the first elementary schools in Queens to participate in the Community Learning Schools Initiative. The 
Community Learning Schools Initiative was launched by the United Federation of Teachers in 2012 with support from 
the New York City Council, the New York State Senate, the Partnership for New York City and Trinity Wall Street. The 
goal of the Community Learning Schools Initiative is to facilitate partnerships between schools, non-profits, business 
and government to connect vital services to public school buildings, improve student achievement and meet the 
health, safety and social service needs of students and communities.  

 

P.S. 65 has made the most progress in establishing community partnerships. The school has a comprehensive strategy 
for keeping families engaged and connected to the school. Although, PS 65 has a high immigrant population with 
many transient students, the school has been successful in involving parents. At the beginning of the year, parents are 
given a survey and this data is used to plan meaningful programs throughout the school year. Parents are also asked 
to indicate if they have an expertise in any area. If so, parents are encouraged to share these special skills or talents 
with our school community in order to enrich our student and parent programming. Any willing parents are trained by 
NY Cares to be certified volunteers. Every Saturday, parent volunteers run classes open to students and families in 
their area of expertise. In 2015-16 community partnerships and parents led the following programs: 

New York Cares volunteers led a weekly Math and Movement program for 51 students; New York Cares trained 
parent volunteers to lead weekly Computer Basics and English Conversation classes for 10 parent participants; a 
teacher from the Department Of Education’s Office of Adult and Continuing Education taught daily English as Second 
Language classes for adult participants; parent volunteers led weekly recreational activities for children and adults, 
including basketball and tennis and Zumba/fitness ; volunteers from Price Waterhouse Cooper led a series of three 
financial literacy workshops for the entire fourth grade; United Federation of Teachers facilitated a monthly book club 
for parent participants; New York Cares provided Winter Wishes gifts for all 500 children at P.S. 65; the New York 
University College of Dentistry provided free teeth cleanings to nearly 500 children; Helen Keller International’s 
ChildSight Program provided low-cost vision screenings for students as well as free glasses for 24 students in need; 
and Fidelis Care provided support in planning, funding, and executing our school’s annual Thanksgiving feast and first 
ever Community Health Fair. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

In addition to strategically using parents as community resources, the school as developed partnerships with New 
Horizons for mental health services, NYU College of Dentistry for dental screening for the school and community, 
Helen Keller Vision Screening for students, LaGuardia Community College for tutoring services, New York Cares for 
student and adult programs, Price WaterHouse Cooper for Financial Literacy courses, Heavenly Angels Animal Rescue, 
FDNY Fire Safety Education, Health Plus, Eat Smart, New York, United Federation of Teachers, NYC Department of 
Social Services, and Rising Star Dance Studio.  

At P.S. 65 the staff works hard to build and sustain positive and productive relationships with parents. We want 
parents to be a part of every aspect of their child’s education. This year’s initiative to engage parents’ involved grades 
or staff members planning a series of interactive parent workshops in order to engage parents in curriculum related 
activities. As a result, in 2016-2017, the school was able to offer parents several workshop opportunities. These 
opportunities included Literacy Pajama Nights, Math Nights as well as a Cultural exchange Night.  

Other key initiatives and celebrations include P.S. 65 being recognized as a Learning Partners Program Host school for 
the first time after serving as a Showcase School for the past three years. These initiatives set the tone for a positive 
school culture Most staff participate voluntarily to plan and run community events. Administration provides 
opportunities such as sign-up sheets in order to encourage participation. All participants in events get the same letter 
of recognition regardless of what they do: volunteer time, help decorate, donate items, or so on. There is also a lot of 
collaboration between staff members, including daily common planning, teacher team meetings, and teacher-
directed professional development.  

PS 65Q key focus for 2018-19 school year will continue to focus on our instructional practices across all curricular 
areas with a focus on implementing the Teacher's College Reading and Writing curricula at our school. In addition, we 
will be focusing on providing professional development to staff on Social Emotional Learning. The school also 
considers school data. The current instructional focus continues to be planning and preparation, particularly in 
regards to literacy practices, which relates directly to the instructional core. In mathematics, the focus is on creating 
rigorous exemplars for students as well as in the implementation of the A4A tenets within all mathematics 
classrooms. This includes the reverse gradual release model. The instructional team will continue to create and 
implement a yearlong professional development plan based on the instructional focus that is differentiated across all 
curricular areas. The goal is to continue this differentiated approach to professional development. The school builds 
capacity across the organization by asking all teachers, not just those with a lot of experience or strong ratings, to 
develop and deliver professional development. P.S. 65 also identifies “universal practices” so that there are common 
practices and expectations across grades and across the school. As an instructional focus for next year, the school will 
develop yearlong unit plans in literacy and mathematics which focus on the needs of all students including 
accommodations for ELLs and Students With Disabilties.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

In regards to special populations within the building, 11% of our student body are ENL students. In addition, 17% of 
our students are students with disabilities. Within these populations the needs are diverse. For our ENL population, 
needs are around language acquisition as well as in reading fluency and phonemic awareness. For our students with 
disabilities, needs are around reading comprehension in grades 3-5 with a particular focus on answering inferential 
questions and decoding and fluency in grades k-2. In addition, a focus is on moving these students from being able to 
verbalize their understanding to putting their thoughts and ideas onto paper. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

This year, we have seen a great deal of success with the elements of Rigorous Instruction as well as Strong Community 
and Family ties. As we move forward, we are going to continue to focus on these areas as well as the element of 
collaborative teachers.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Evidence of need in this area came from a variety of sources. These included 2017 NYS ELA exam results which 
showed 45% of students in grades 3-5 performing at grade level. In the area of literacy, we have seen a gain of 7% in 
literacy on the NYS ELA exam. 

 
We continue to departmentalize across all curricular areas including Reading and Writing this year based upon the 
growth shown across this data point. In addition, differentiated professional development was provided across these 
areas. This professional development is being provided in the area of literacy as we are a Teacher's College Project 
school. We have moved to utilizing Teacher's College for both reading and writing as a curriculum. 

 

Curriculum mapping continues across these new units of study with a focus on students with disabilities as well as ENL 
students.  

Math data on NYS assessments showed an increase of 4% of students performing at levels at grade level moving the 
school from 37% at level to 41%. Our school has become a part of the Algebra for All initiative so as to further move 
students forward in the area of mathematics with a focus on writing in this curricular area as well as problem solving. 
Professional development in the area of mathematics is provided by our Algebra for All teacher as well as our 
assistant principal. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

1.  By June 2019, teachers will receive departmentalized professional development in the areas of reading and 
writing as part of the TC Reading & Writing Project Schools initiative, which will lead to 100% of all students 
attaining at least one years growth on the June 2019 Teachers College Running Records as compared to June 
2018

As we move toward the 2018-2019 school year, we continue to look for opportunities to engage parents in learning 
opportunities that will assist them in becoming partners in their children's learning. During the 2017-2018 school year, 
we had the most success in bringing parents into the school at times when student work was on display (ie the 
Science Fair) or when students had an opportunity to share what they had learned with parents. Only 65% of of 
families say they get opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as observing instruction or participating in an 
activity with their child,”  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, as a result of increased parent engagement and celebratory activities during the school day, there will be 
a 15% increase (from 65% to 80%) in the percentage “of families that say they get opportunities to visit their child's 
classroom, such as observing instruction or participating in an activity with their child,” as measured by the results of the 
2019 NYC School Survey.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of 
this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. 
P.S. 65Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and 
implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support 
of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, 
and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

P.S. 65Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

   This program will provide preparation for students for the NYSESLAT exam. Historical data 
has shown that our ELL population has benefited tremendously from this program in past years. 
To ensure positive results for this subgroup, the program will continue to be implemented as 
is..  It will cover the Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking strands of the NYSESLAT. 
Grades 2-5 students will be represented.  All ELL students in Grades 2-5 will be invited to 
participate in the program.The program will be held on Wednesdays from 2:20-4:20 and 
Saturdays from 9-12. It will begin in October and end in June  2017 for a total of 47 
sessions.  The language of instruction will be English.  There will be two teachers in the 
program. Two classes will be held. One for grades 2/3 and one for grades 4/5.  Materials used 
include Achieving on the NYSESLAT by Pearson. Classes contain 15-20 students. Teachers will 
provide instruction to students in the core areas of the NYS NYSESLAT exam.   The program 
will provide whole group and small group instruction. In addition, technology will be utilized to 
teach through the use of visuals. Students will also be progress monitored through the I ready 
program.      Data from previous year NYSESLAT will be utilized to guide instruction.    This 
included data from I-ready diagnostic baseline as well as information from student interviews 
and classroom student watching. In addition, progress monitoring data will assist.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
  
Our school uses data from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, as well as Fountas and Pinnell Running Records to inform early year 
planning and instructional moves. These data points include NYS ELA exam results as well as internal assessments provided. As 
the year progresses, ongoing running records,  teacher-created assessments, rubric based tasks, common core aligned 
checklists, and conference notes guide instruction,  and allow us to move our ELLs into different groups as their language 
acquisition and skills increase. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We begin to analyze the data in the beginning of the year during professional development, grade meetings and 
vertical/department inquiry meetings.  The data for each student is shared so that each teacher has an understanding of the 
child’s strengths and weaknesses. We have three benchmark periods for Fountas and Pinnell, September, January and May; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

teachers are encouraged to progress monitor between these benchmark intervals so growth and next steps can be determined 
sooner.  Teachers also create curriculum maps  for each unit of study, from these maps, each lesson created contains ELL 
specific support. The teacher and the ENL teacher collaborate to create strategies and scaffolds to support these students 
during the lesson. Teachers meet twice a month to review student data, student work products as well as to plan and create 
curriculum maps.  During this time, administration assists in this review. In addition, professional development is provided in 
the review, disaggregation and use of student data to guide instruction. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our schools uses NYSITELL and NYSESLAT data to identify a baseline as well as growth for the ELLs. Additionally, we have 3 
benchmark periods for Fountas and Pinnell running records. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the data is collected and analyzed, the implications from the initial assessment and data from growth demonstrated on 
these assessments, are used to determine student grouping and focus points. We also use this data to provide interventions 
such as RTI, afterschool, and Saturday school. All of which are accessible for ENL students as well. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Paste response to queIn accordance  with the RTI Framework for ELLs, our English language learners who under perform or 
make little to no progress on the NYSESLAT or other benchmark assessments, will be taken into consideration for targeted 
interventions in both the tier 2 and tier 3 models. Certain factors also to be considered are the student’s linguistic capabilities, 
progress towards English proficiency, years of ELL service, and teacher recommendation. These will jointly be used to 
determine the best course of action in providing  additional support services. Student data is reviewed every 6-8 weeks.  This 
data is used to move students throughout the various tiers to either a less intensive approach or a more intensive 
intervention.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We utilize the data from the previous years NYSESLAT and NYS ELA/Math exam performance to inform instructional moves, 
design effective instructional programs, create focused subgroups, and determine interventions that might be necessary in 
order to ensure progress toward achieving proficiency. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

At PS 65, the ENL teacher pulls-out students for ENL services.  She provides both the integrated and stand-alone services using 
this model. After analysis of school-wide ENL data, trends are noted and implications for instructional moves are created. In 
order to close the gap and help students make adequate growth, the students are grouped by grade and proficiency levels, and 
then into further subgroups for more targeted instruction. The goal is to provide students with effective instructional programs 
that have interventions in place,  Additionally, professional development in the beginning of the year is given to the entire staff 
to review the school-wide data, inclusive of ELL assessments,  where teachers can look carefully at their ELL population and 
create a strategic plan of action. They work collaboratively with the ENL teacher to include speaking and listening and language 
targets, plan differentiated activities and scaffolds. Data is reviewed, by department, amongst the teachers as well as

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

As per CR Part 154.2, Our Freestanding ENL program provides a Pull-out model for instruction in English by our dually 
certified ENL teacher. In classrooms our students are grouped heterogeneously at each grade level. We feel that 
student’s make further gains in acquiring the language, as there are more opportunities for authentic communication 
with fluent English speakers and a more rigorous curriculum when they are in mixed populations. 
Our ENL teacher provides both Stand-Alone and Integrated instruction in the Pull-out model, for the number of 
mandated minutes,  where English Language Arts and content area subjects are embedded into her curriculum. This 
instruction is planned to ensure curricular alignment and continuity of instruction. There is continuous collaboration 
between the ENL teacher and the classroom teachers. Students are grouped by NYSESLAT proficiency levels within 
and across grades. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 We do not have TBE program.  

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    
We do not have DL program. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

     
As per CR Part 154-2, mandated instructional units required for ELLs differ by levels of proficiency. Based on 
NYSITELL/NYSESLAT scores, Entering and Emerging ELLs receive 2 units/360 minutes a week of ENL instruction; this is broken 
into eight 45 minute periods. Transitioning and Commanding ELLs receive 1 unit/180 minutes  per week of ENL instruction 
broken into four 45 minute periods. Commanding ELLs receive .5 unit/90 minutes per week of instruction broken into two 45 
minute periods. Student are grouped in grade bands K/1, 2/3, and 4/5 ; each of these grade bands are divided into two groups, 
Entering/Emerging and Transitioning/Expanding/Commanding.  This ensures that each group receives their mandated minutes 
of instruction. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In our ENL program, English Language Arts instruction is blended with Science and Social Studies to ensure that students are 
receiving rigorous, quality instruction that meet the CCLS  and NYS ELL standards, as well as the four modalities, speaking, 
listening, reading, and writing which are necessary for language acquisition. Our program uses a balanced approach to literacy, 
including high-quality instructional practices that facilitate academic excellence for ELLs.  Grade level curricula materials are 
utilized and supplemented with independent reading leveled texts and other print materials and technological resources to 
make the content accessible for each level of ELL proficiency.  We have an array of scaffolds and differentiation techniques 
used with our ELL students. 
ELL students at PS 65 have access to a variety of instructional materials to aide and promote  their learning,  including: 
language/translation dictionaries, NYS translation guides, translation programs, Raz-kids online leveled reading materials in 
English and Spanish, Imagine Learning software, iPads and Laptops are also utilized daily. 
Our students are taught how to use a multitude of strategies, and are given continuous opportunities to practice them. Some 
of these  ENL strategies that are applied are close reading techniques, using/creating  graphic organizers, sentence and 
paragraph frames, creating outlines, using  TPR, realias, dialogues and role-playing. Our ENL teacher also embeds phonics, 
grammar and word fluency instruction into every lesson. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

In addition, this past year our school departmentalized instruction in all grade K-5, this approach to teaching, gives all students 
access to the same rigorous quality education as their peers, with a content specific teacher in Reading, Writing, Math, Social 
Studies, and Science.  As our classes are heterogeneously created, the content/department teachers work collaboratively with 
the ENL teacher to support the needs of the ELL students. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Our school ensures that all ELL students are evaluated  in their native language whenever possible and as mandated. We 
administer the Spanish Lab to native Spanish speaking students.  Students also have the opportunity to take all NYS exams in 
the content areas that are available in their native language; if their home language is not available. translators are provided. 
Additionally, our Go Math curriculum has unit tests in Spanish, teachers use translation software for other languages.  We also 
have a bilingual staff that speak Spanish, Arabic, Urdi, Punjabi, and Hindi, as well as wonderful family volunteers that help us to 
support our students as needed. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

5a.  SIFE students receive extended instructional time.  This would be provided during after school classes, Saturday programs, 
and summer programs.  All other opportunities available for ELL students would be available to SIFE's as well.        Greater 
outreach to parents needs to be provided from the school to better educate them in making intelligent choices that will best 
suit their child's needs.  This not only includes the various ELL programs to choose from, but the structure and methods of the 
current ELL program that is in place. 
5b.  Our Newcomers are placed in a class that offers them a not only a nurturing environment where they can easily transition 
into the new academic setting but where they can have a language partner as well. These students will receive 360 minutes or 
eight 45-minute periods a week of Standalone and Integrated ENL services. Within that setting,  the ENL teacher helps them 
develop their  basic interpersonal skills in English by engaging in daily socialization skills, conversations, and developing 
vocabulary, in addition Newcomers are provided a  very scaffolded literacy immersion and content instruction, this is done 
with use of visuals, realia, manipulatives, and total physical response to name a few.  While in the general education 
classroom,  teachers will collaborate with the ENL teacher to provide a sheltered instructional plan in order to provide 
students with strategies and scaffolds to address their needs. We place a strong emphasis on developing  the whole child and 
with our newcomers, we embrace their home language and try to build strong family ties. 5c.   Our Developing ELL students 
will receive 180 minutes of Standalone and Integrated ENL, and will have more emphasis placed on their reading and writing 
skills integrated within the content area using ELL methodologies and scaffolds. Students will be taught using the gradual 
release of responsibility model, and will learn strategies to take learning into their own hands, such as self monitoring, 
speaking and listening skills training, close reading techniques and organizational methods.  An After-school Program is offered 
to support their progress. 5d.  Students who are Long Term ELLs and have not made adequate progress on the NYSESLAT or 
state ELA and/or Math exams will continue to receive their mandated ENL hours based on their proficiency level and are also 
given additional supports. These student’s individual needs are analyzed via school-wide data and conversations with past and 
present teachers. A plan is created collaboratively with the classroom, ENL and RTI teachers, to support the child in developing 
their weaknesses in phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, comprehension and writing skills. These students are carefully 
monitored to ensure the plan for them is effective and the teacher teams continue to reflect collaboratively and adjust 
practices as best suited for the child.  The student is also provided additional learning opportunities during  after-school and 
Saturday programming .   
5e.  Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status will receive  90 minutes of integrated ENL/ or other content area using 
ELL methodologies.  The emphasis will be on fine tuning their skills in the four modalities, speaking, listening, reading and 
writing with a gradual release of responsibility model. Testing accommodations are continue. These students are also provided 
supports such as dictionaries, thesauruses, word lists and other tools to help them maintain their development of the English 
language in their classrooms . 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 ELL students that are also classified as Special Education will receive all services afforded to them by their IEP and by  CR Part 
154.2.   All special education students will receive ENL services as described by the level of proficiency they have achieved on 
the NYSESLAT. They will be mixed with other students in a similar grade band and proficiency level. during pull-out ENL 
services.  These  ELL-SWDs also require individual methods of instruction that are developed collaboratively with the SE 
teacher, ENL teacher and service provider in order to give strategic and specific need based instruction based on their IEP. 
Further differentiated materials, teaching techniques, and scaffolded presentation approaches are used to accommodate each 
child's special needs.  After School program is offered to support student progress.  ELL-SWD students receive the mandated 
instruction from a licensed Special Education teacher either in a self-contained setting or in an ICT setting.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school offers curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to all ELL-SWDs. Service providers and SE teachers 
conference with the ENL teacher to create a schedule for each child’s that accommodates their IEP.  The ENL teacher has time 
to review all of the IEPs of her ELL-SWDs  and create an instructional plan that provides specific skills and strategies to meet 
their needs.  The ENL teacher is also involved in developing or adding to the student’s IEP to ensure that his/her language 
acquisition needs are accommodated and reachable goals are created. The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher 
differentiate lessons and offer similar strategies in order to have continuity and consistency in both the classroom and during 
ENL pull-out instruction 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our targeted intervention plan is given to ELLs in core areas of ELA and Math. Our ELLs are grouped by proficiency levels to 
ensure targeted  small group support that is academically appropriate. The targeted ELL subgroups are: entering/emerging and 
transitioning/expanding. Our focus is to develop and strengthen their speaking and listening skills to foster proper language 
development;  foundational and fluency skills that accelerate their reading and writing ability; and vocabulary work to develop 
their background knowledge in the content areas. In addition to a strong direct instruction, our ELL students also have 
personalized access to Imagine Learning, which is a targeted computer-based intervention program specifically designed to 
develop the 5 Pillars of Literacy- phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. It has 
embedded  assessments and progress monitoring so that teachers can closely monitor each student's strengths and 
weaknesses. We are also providing each of our ELL students with personal access to Raz-Kids, an online resource of  thousands 
of leveled texts that they can read or listen to, then answer comprehension questions. Many of these books are also available 
in Spanish to foster their literacy development in their native language.  Both of these programs are accessible to students in 
school and at home.  Our school also provides targeted intervention during ENL After-school and ENL Saturday school.  In the 
classroom, teachers provide students with small group instruction in conjunction with recommendations from the ENL teacher. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

New programs in our school are:a.  LaGuardia Community College partnership, where student teachers and students observers 
provide in-classroom and individualized tutoring support.b.  New York Cares, which is Math and Movement c.  Teacher-led 
programming of ELL After-schoold.  Online academic programs on Imagine Learning and Raz-Kids 
e. Teachers College Reading and Writing Program (school-wide implementation) 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There are no programs/services that will be discontinued in out school.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
The ELLs in our school have equal access to all school programs and curriculum, including school-wide character building, 
Career Day, and school trips. With the use of our allocated Title III  Funds, we have been able to offer our ELLS an invitation to 
stay for our ENL  Afterschool program on Wednesdays and Thursdays, as well as a special Saturday program for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

ELLs.  Additionally,  we have a student leadership program on Mondays and Fridays that hosts a variety of clubs and learning 
experiences for all students in the school to join. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We have an array of instructional materials that are used to support our ELLs. Curriculum materials are thematically built upon 
from a variety of sources including NG Reach, Learning A-Z, Leveled library books, trade books, ReadWorks, News ELA, and TFK 
materials, to name a few. This year we will be adopting Teacher College Reading and Writing Programs, that will also offer 
strategies and materials to support ELLs.   Our Go Math curriculum offers differentiated activities and manipulatives that are 
used for ELLs support.  Glossaries, bilingual and picture dictionaries, word walls, anchor charts and leveled texts support ELL 
reading in the regular classrooms and while in ENL class. To build language and phonics, our ELL students receive additional 
instruction during Stand-alone ENL class where a variety of tools and resources are used. Our ELL students also receive daily 
access to the computer program Imagine Learning, and for our youngest learners, we also utilize Starfall and ABC Mouse. The 
all classrooms are equipped with a Promethean Boards and access to laptops that are used to facilitate learning.  The ENL 
classroom also has iPads and Kindle Fires that are used during instruction to give students further access to texts, videos, 
audio, and visuals to further their engagement in learning English. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Translation and communication between student and teacher is continuous.  Students that do not yet know how to express 
their needs and wants in English can use their native tongue to do so. The ENL teacher uses the student's native language 
where possible to help clarify the student's understanding of a concept. Bilingual dictionaries and Google Translate is often 
used for the teacher and non-English speakers to communicate. There are also language partners in almost every class that are 
fluent in both the native language and English to assist in fostering communication and English development.   Native language 
is also used when communicating with the parents of ELL students; we utilize bilingual staff, family volunteers and the NYCDOE 
Translation and Interpretation services as necessary to guarantee understanding and open communication.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our programming and schedules are created so that  ELL students receive their required services based on proficiency levels 
and grade bands. Entering and Emerging student in each grade band (K/1, ⅔, ⅘) receive 360 minutes of ENL weekly and 
Transitioning and Expanding students in each grade band receive 180 minutes of ENL weekly. Our Commanding students join 
the Transitioning and Expanding students in their appropriate grade band 90 minutes per week. 
In the general classroom ELL students are looked at individually and are grouped in our reading program based Fountas & 
Pinnell assessments as well as language proficiency and comprehension ability. This allows the student to grow in all 
modalities. The same hold true in math, students are grouped using a combination of math readiness, skill and language 
skills.  Students are provided grade level concepts in a way that is differentiated for their level.  Grade level standards are used 
to guide instruction and lesson planning. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
When new ELL  children are enrolled in our school, the ENL teacher and the Parent Coordinator meet with families for our ELL 
orientation, where the different programs offered in NYC schools are explained. The Parent Coordinator and the Community 
School Liaison also offer a variety of workshops to help families with strategies for their child’s success throughout the year.   
As a community learning school, we offer an array of activities throughout the year to support our ELLs as well as all of our 
students. Some of these activities include 
a. Our school has Saturday and After School activities from grades K-5 led by parents, parent coordinator,  teachers, and 
representatives from our sponsors.b.  Power Play NYC which focuses on empowerment through sports, games, and team 
building.c.  Common Threads is a nutrition education partnership which provides students with hands-on cooking lessons that

is a recycling champions program that engages students in making school more sustainable.f.  Monthly grade-wide charitable 
endeavors  that teaches students the importance of giving to others by engaging them in student-led drives for charities, 
including St. Jude, Children's Hospital, City Harvest, Toys for Tots, Ronald McDonald House, and more.g.  School-wide programs 
and assemblies such as Winter Wishes, Corporate-sponsored  events through New York Care, NYPD "Stranger Danger", and 
Apple Corps Traffic Safety Program(DOT). 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our school does not offer language electives to ELLs. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have have Dual Language programs.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional Development for our ENL teacher is ongoing. Our region provides monthly ENL/Bilingual professional 
development  where she attends the Queens South ELL Instructional Leadership Institute (EILI) professional learning 
series,  which affords opportunities to discuss current research, best practices, materials, NYS-ELL standards, instructional 
strategies that align with Core Curriculum, and the application of these strategies. Our ENL teacher also attends compliance 
meetings offered by Office of DELLSS, as well as school-wide professional development with emphasis on Literacy 
Awareness.Our ENL teacher is also part of our school’s Professional Development Team, where she provides workshops to 
turnkey information, presents topics to support teachers in strategies for their ELL student’s success, and ELL data analysis. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ENL teacher is sent to Professional Developments sponsored by the Queens South ELL Team, Office of DELLSS, Department 
of Education, and is provided with books and materials for ELLs success.  ENL professional development for our monolingual 
classroom teachers is also provided in order to address the large number of ELL students in grades Kindergarten to Grade 
5.  ENL professional development for our classroom teachers are provided by administration and the ENL teacher on a variety 
of topics  in order to best meet the needs of our ELL population and analyze trends in NYSESLAT data to created targeted 
groups and interventions. All workshops have agendas and sign-in sheets to ensure compliance is met. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

 

Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our school's ENL teacher meets individually with the parents or guardians of English language learners  at least once a 
year.  This includes ELL Parent Orientation, schoolwide parent orientation, parent teacher conferences, and other scheduled 
meetings as needed to provide  parents or guardians their child's language development progress, English language proficiency 
assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  A qualified interpreter/translator in the language of 
the parent or guardian best understands is always provided in these meetings. Attendance is recorded at all times and kept on 
file. At our Meet the teacher, parents are told of the goals of the program as well as the school wide results.  In addition, 
individual parent meetings are scheduled and held by the ESL teacher with parents to discuss student needs as well as progress 
across content areas. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our school is committed to developing a positive relationships with our school community, As part of our family outreach, 
parents are invited to become part of their child’s school experience, By fostering relationships with our ELL parents, we know 
we can help the “whole”child grow in a multitude of ways.   As a Community Learning School, we provide families with events 
such as Health Fair, Career Day, Common Threads nutrition classes, Hispanic Federation sponsored literacy workshops, Adult 
ESL.  Parent Workshops through the Parent Coordinator, Parent Book Club, Family Math and Literacy Nights, Dad Take Your 
Child to Work Day, Multicultural Celebration, School Leadership Tea, Breakfast with Santa, Parent Volunteers, and our 
extensive PTA provide opportunities for all ELL parents to be part of PS65.   
In addition, the ELL parents maintain integral involvement with the school during Back to School Night, Parent Conferences in 
the fall and spring and other academic events. Translated letters and flyers are sent home to ensure families know the 
wonderful events our school offers

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Rafael Morales, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Data included to assess language preferences include the HLIS as well as emergency blue cards. In addition, a 
school wide parent survey is distributed to parents to ascertain need. Finally, our ELL teacher conducts intake 
interviews to gather information regarding parent language preference.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Our school calls families based on yearly blue card and HLIS information. We have several staff members that are bi-
lingual in most of the languages that or LEP families speak. We also have a strong parent partnership, when available 
these families help us communicate. When necessary we use the over the phone DOE T&I unit.  

When LEP families need to communicate with staff in the event of an emergency, a bi-lingual staff member or parent 
volunteers help. Additionally, we will utilize computer based translations when necessary.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

In order to ensure that all staff members are aware of how to use translation services and over-the-phone 
interpretation service, a staff meeting is held at the beginning of the school year to inform the staff of the available 
services. Also, procedures are reviewed before all parent-teacher conferences. Our school's Parent Coordinator Pattie 
Musalin will serve as the primary Language Access Coordinator, she will ensure that staff has access to all needed 
interpretation services. Jennifer Milio, our school's ENL teacher will work collaboratively with Pattie, to guide and 
support the staff with parent language information and other materials needed to assist them.

Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Our school makes LEP parents and families aware of their rights and important school information by having an array 
of displays located in the main lobby and in the office.  

These include but are not limited to:  

Bulletin Boards with DOE supplied translated signage, welcome letters, Parent's Bill of Rights, monthly calendars, 
parent engagement event displays, and PTA information. 

We also share information with LEP families by sending home translated notices including: 

Brochures, flyers, monthly newsletters and calendars.  

All parent engagement events are also translated, including PTA meetings, parent workshops, and community 
outreach events. 

Our school is part of the Community Learning School Initiative, which brings on-site partnerships with OACE, the 
Hispanic Federation, New York Cares and many others. These partners give resources, provide workshops, offer 
classes, and send translation volunteers to aide our school and LEP families at events like parent curriculum night, 
parent conferences, ELL Parent Orientation, and other needed events. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parent surveys are distributed at various times in the year including September and mid year, additionally, face to face 
meeting offers us real time feedback. These surveys and oral feedback inform us of the quality and availability of 
services and information, they ascertain the needs of our parent body as well as guide parent programming.
