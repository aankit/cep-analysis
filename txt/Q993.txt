Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The mission of P993Q is to help students achieve academic success and reach their highest potential to ensure they 
are prepared for the next phase of their education. P993Q's focus is placed on providing opportunities for all students 
to have the ability to move towards Less Intensive Services (LIS) and, or Least Restrictive Environments (LRE). P993Q 
designs instruction aligned to CCLS, based on the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools. This provide 
students with rigorous, individualized and engaging instruction with emphasis on Specially Designed Instruction (SDI) 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

and technology supports. Staff are provided with multiple professional development opportunities. Teacher 
professional development is provided throughout the school year to support school initiatives and student 
performance. Teacher teams meet to collaborate on areas such as but are not limited to assessments, autism 
awareness, behavior supports and instruction for best practices. Administrators ensure horizontal and vertical 
coherence in order to build capacity across all P993Q sites. Multi-tiered support systems are put in place for all of the 
students of P993 including ENL’s to ensure all learning styles are met. The administration take into consideration that 
P993Q serves various populations and continues to foster a balanced, academic, social and emotional environment to 
support our diverse stakeholders within the school community. Emphasis is also placed on transition programs to 
prepare students for college and career readiness. Administrators and staff continue to establish a caring and safe 
environment that provides a culture of mutual trust among staff, students and parents. P993Q administration 
continues to build a cohesive parent engagement program that emphasizes the importance of parental involvement 
in their child’s education process. Parent coordinator collaborates with administration to provide workshops, trainings 
and class activities with parents to create strong family and community ties.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P993Q continues to focus on building capacity and student access across all sites by promoting high quality education 
for its diverse population of learners, including ENL’s. This is demonstrated through collaborative inquiry teams. 
Administrators delegate teacher leadership positions to ensure compliance across various areas (e.g. IEP, testing 
coordinator, transition coordinator, parent coordinator, data teams, etc.).  

A culture of mutual trust and high expectations continue to be communicated across all sites to ensure programs are 
in place to meet the various needs of learners at P993Q. 94% of teachers agree that the principal/school leaders, 
teachers and staff collaborate to make the school run effectively as per the School Quality Guide. School leadership 
team, cabinet meetings and UFT consultation meetings are held on monthly and “as needed” basis to review data and 
monitor programs. Teacher teams meet to collaborate, review data and refine instruction that promote higher levels 
of student thinking to ensure access and equity across the school environment. Baseline, midyear and summartive 
student data is collected and analyzed during IEP reviews, teacher team meetings, parent conferences and post 
observation feedback to guarantee rigorous instruction. Effective school leadership is aligned to the Danielson 
Framework which ensures rigorous instruction, student safety, effective transition planning and strong family 
engagement.  

As a multi-site school, P993Q celebrates our school's accomplishments for Grades K-12, as follows: 

* Students were chosen to participate in the planning of a new school playground with general education students.  

* Opened a brand new science lab for their new STEM program where students have participated in many different 
science experiments, activities and a science fair that students and parents attended this past spring. 

* Emphasized parent engagement activities throughout the holidays and through the school year, 

* Special education students participated in the CHAMPS program after school where students continued to learn 
about making healthy choices and exercising 2 days a week after school. 

* Inclusion students in grades 6-8 participated in the College Access for All program where students had the 
opportunity to visit Queensborough Community College to begin preparing them for college and career readiness. 

* A sensory diet program was initiated supporting students within the program in 12:1:1, 12:1:4 and 6:1:1 classes. 

* Students continue to participate in the Student Advocacy Program. Two students are ambassadors for the program 
and have worked hard researching how to advocate for students with hearing impairments. Their goal is to bring 
closed captioning to auditorium assemblies. This goal was accomplished. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

* Students continue to participate in various worksites and training courses to ensure effective transition planning. 
Some of the training courses include CPR, web design and child care. Three students passes and received their first aid 
and CPR certificate.  

* Individual student council's have been developed throughout our high school programs. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

P993Q is a multi-sited school, K-12, in District 75 serving students with challenges that include multiple handicaps, 
intellectual disabilities, emotional disturbances, and autism. P993Q consists of 2 barrier free sites that support 
students with physical and mobility difficulties. The use of augmentative devices support students with 
communication needs including ENL students. Students on the autistic spectrum and emotional challenges are 
provided specific techniques and strategies to support their needs. In addition, Nurses, Related services, such as, OT, 
PT, Speech, Hearing, Vision, Health & Crisis Paraprofessional support our diversified special populations. Both 
alternate and standardized students are served within all P993Q sites.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

For the 2017-18 school year, P993Q’s made the most progress in the areas reflected in our CEP goals for that year. 

Rigorous Instruction -- Increased math scores for our alternate assessment students by using adapted curriculum, 
UDL strategies and collaborative teacher teams to “plan-implement-reflect and adjust” lessons. CEP goal was met 
with a 5% average increase in math as measured by SANDI/FAST. 

Supportive Environment – Decreased disruptive behaviors in 6:1:1 classes, grades K-12 through the use of: 
Therapeutic Crisis Intervention Strategies (TCIS), Get Ready to Learn (GRTL), 4Rs program and the creation and 
monitoring of appropriate Functional Behavior Plans/Behavior Intervention Plan (FBA/BIPs.) CEP goal was met with a 
28% reduction in A25 and 33% decrease in B24. 

Collaborative Teachers – Attended/created professional learning communities and receive on-going training in autism 
awareness supported by district coaches, teacher meetings and extended day meetings. CEP goal was met with a 5% 
average increase in staff participation. 

Effective School Leadership – Standard and alternate assessment students in grades 3-8 transitioning to a less

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
It was determined after review of summative and alternate assessment formative baseline data that the K-2 students 
at P993Q required improvement in basic reading skills. Data from SANDI/FAST determined that most 8:1:1 students in 
the 2017-18 school year, scored in the Level 1 or 2 Level. In order to progress to a higher level teachers must focus on 
instruction and assessments in areas such as phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. 
P993Q will be opening up 3 additional 8:1:1 K-2 classes, mostly consisting of kindergarten students. Administrators 
want to support the 3 new and existing 8:1:1 classes by assuring that data teams are in place. Data teams will analyze 
assessment scores in reading, determine the progression of learning and collaborate with classroom teachers to 
implement the accommodations and modifications in instruction to help students achieve their highest potential and 
improve their ELA skills. 

P993Q’s strengths in the element of rigorous instruction relative to the Framework for Great Schools include: 

  A comprehensive data team will continue to foster deeper understanding of assessments throughout the 

school community. 

  Coaches, inter-visitations and professional development are encouraged and available to support staff in 

areas of assessment, instruction, positive behavior supports, IEP, compliance and social skills development. 

  During the 2017-18 school year administration spent approximately 30% of the P993Q budget on Core 

Curriculum to support the various needs of individual students at P993Q and will continue to do in 2018-19. 
  Collaborative inquiry teams were formed and continue to be developed in reviewing student work samples, 

identifying student strengths and weakness, and refining instruction. Collaborative inquiry teams discuss ways 
to improve instruction, assessments and teaching strategies.  

  The School Quality Guide states that 92% of teachers believe the principal/school leaders make their 

expectations clear for meeting instructional goals.  

  The School Quality Guide also indicates that 99% of teachers felt they are able to modify instructional 

activities and materials to meet the development needs and learner interests of all their students. 

The ENL Team collaborate and ensures that assessments and instruction are aligned to speaking and listening goals in 
the IEP

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

P993Q fosters an inclusive culture of mutual trust and safety with academic and emotional supports that prepare 
students to transition into college, career and adulthood. Administration has a strong belief that Prevocational and 
vocational programs play a large part in developing the social, emotional and academic skills needed to transition into 
the next phase of each student’s education and/or adulthood. 

Some of P993Q’s strengths related to the element of Supportive Environment include: 

  During the 2017-18 school year, over 80 students at 2 sites participated in the pre-vocational curriculum and 

65 students were actively engaged in Community Based Learning at worksites at LICHS and FSSA  

  Transition programs use assessments such as interest inventories to help place students in pre-vocational 

learning activities and worksites best fitted for students. 

  Core Curriculum such as Attainment-Life Skills Curriculum and Unique Transitions Bands continued to be 

purchased to support Career development occupational studies standards. 

  Transition coordinator, job developer, physical therapists and classroom teacher collaborate to discuss 

transition curriculum and provide instruction to develop skills needed to succeed in the workplace. 

Over the past 3 years, the number of high school students enrolled in the transition and pre-vocational program 
continue to increase. It was determined that after reviewing transition trends in student performance in transitional 
programs, parent feedback and student interest inventories to assess student preferences we identified the need for 
the expansion of transitional training opportunities to our middle school. This goal is designed to develop middle 
school students skills needed to succeed in the workplace and begin conversation about college and career readiness.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 50% of middle school students at MS72 will participate in a transition or occupational studies program 
as measured by class enrollment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

P993Q administration believes that teacher collaboration is an important component in order to build strong 
pedagogy skills in areas that includes instruction, assessment and community outreach. Data trends on formative 
teacher assessments show that students have a limited knowledge and exposure to the components of STEM. It was 
determined after review of teacher formative assessments, NYSAA and NYS Common Core that students required 
improvement in science inquiry, practical skills and technology. For the 2018-19 school year one primary focus is for 
classroom teachers K-8 to collaborate with STEM teachers on increasing student participation and exposure in STEM 
activities, lessons and units of study. 

  Data shows that staff participated in 370 PDs during the 2017-18 school year in 13 areas of instruction, with 

73 workshops were in STEM. Coaches and lead teachers continue to be utilized to support teachers and 
students in all areas.  
Flexible scheduling allows for classroom teachers and STEM teachers the ability to collaborate. These 
meetings will provide the time to plan, refine and assess instruction, utilizing the student work protocol.  
  During the 2017-18 school year, P993Q opened 2 STEM labs at 2 sites and purchased FOSS curriculum. In 

 

 

addition P993 purchased the Amplify Science program through core curriculum. These programs will support 
learners with a student-centered curriculum that fosters an inquiry approach.  
Staff participated and collaborated in professional learning communities and teacher teams that analyze 
student work samples, develop interventions, refine instruction and share successful teaching practices. This 
year we will initiate the Professional Learning Community (PLC) in the area of STEM with emphasis on 
assessment. 

P993Q will continue to develop the STEM program to increase student’s performances and activities in STEM. A 
priority for the administration is to add an additional lab and purchase additional FOSS kits and Amplify core 
curriculum to continue to expand the program and expose more students to the STEM program. Teachers will 
collaborate through flexible scheduling, inter-visitations and team meetings to develop assessments and instruction 
that are coherent across each site. Coaches and professional development opportunities at the district and school 
level will be provided to support STEM labs and activities. Inquiry teams will be formed to refine formative and 
summative assessments. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017-18 School Quality Guide states that 97% of teachers believe that their principal sets high standards for 
student learning. Administrators continue to provide support to teachers in developing best practice strategies and 
developing lessons that are rigorous, engaging and individualized to meet student’s needs through various 
professional development opportunities. P993Q believes that positive changes in schools are driven by the data 
collection process that identifies trends and patterns. Administration is aware that data collection should be a priority 
focus of our school. The availability and importance of data collection and technology will provide information that 
meets the needs of students academic, behavior and social skills. It's imperative to expand the data team by adding 
additional members to our existing team in order to support the various populations, sites and age ranges within 
P993Q. With the continued addition of classes, initiative programs and behavior supports, administration believes this 
priority is needed to help monitor progress, strengths, and weakness and identify next steps. Some of the strengths of 
P993Q’s Effective Leadership are: 

  Monthly collaborative inquiry data meetings will be held to analyze student work samples for strengths, 

weaknesses and next steps.  

  Administration collaborates with data team to discuss curriculum, programing and assessments to evaluate 

effectiveness and next steps. 

  Administrators continue to purchase curriculum that engages students in designing a learner-centered 
curriculum aligned to CCLS; which integrates basic and higher level thinking to address the diverse and 
individualized needs of each student population. 

  Teachers use formal and informal assessments to check for student learning and encourage students to 

monitor their own progress through the use of student assessments. 

Administrators continue to communicate their high expectations and provide teachers with flexible scheduling 
allowing for collaborative teacher meetings, extended day professional learning opportunities and district level 
professional development. This has resulted in 66% of teachers rated as highly effective and 33% of teachers rated 
effective for the 2017-18 school year. Administrators used data from student and teacher achievements to develop 
next steps in ensuring the continuation of highly effective and effective teacher’s best practices. This year there will 
be additional staff added to the data team to make data more accessible and thorough. These teams will create and 
refine instruction and assessments used across all content areas. It is felt that the additional data team members will 
ensure that all the data that is collection is comprehensive and becomes accessible in a timely fashion. Through the 
use of monthly collaborative teacher meetings and professional development opportunities in technology 
administrators want to create a team of teachers who will develop systems and templates across all content areas to 
refine data collection to ensure best practices in all classrooms.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017 School Quality Guide states that 93% of parents/guardians believe P993 works closely with them to meet 
their child’s needs. Additionally, 96% of parent/guardians trust the principal at her word to do what she says she will 
do. The Framework For Great Schools emphasizes the importance of developing and welcoming the collaboration 
with families and community-based organizations by bringing in resources from the community into the school 
environment. P993Q’s administration fosters mutual partnership, interaction, and trust between the school and each 
student’s individual school community. Parents have expressed to P993Q's administration the need for independence 
for their children and have made it a priority to enhance participation in the Access for All program. 

The strengths for strong family and community ties include: 

  Weekly communication between teachers and related service provides with parents via phone calls, 

communication log and parent engagement activities.  

  Title lll Saturday Institute conducts workshops specifically geared towards ENL students and families.  
  Parent Coordinator organizes informational workshops, family outreach, and recreational programs for 

families. 

  Planning trips into the community (post office, library, police station, etc.) to provide students with the 

opportunity to apply and practice appropriate behavior in the community. 

During the 2017-18 school year, students at Cardozo HS were ambassadors for the student advocacy team where they 
did research and presented information about hearing impairments to classmates and their school principal. At FSSA, 
student advisory team planned a prom by holding meetings to discuss the idea, propose the plan to the principal and 
assigning student’s jobs in organizing their prom. Due to parent enthusiasm, overwhelming success, and positive 
feedback of the advocacy program, administration has decided to expand this program to all sites at P993Q. Parents 
have expressed the need for their children to become more independent and be active participants in planning their 
future therefore P993Q'd priority will emphasis the creation of school advocacy teams, parent engagement and 
participation in the Access for All program. Administration believes that these teams will provide students with the 
opportunity to develop a voice in decision making in academic, social and community activities within the school and 
community at large.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS Q993, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title III Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS Q993 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

   P993Q proposes to continue the Title III Saturday Instructional Institute for the 2018-19 school 
year. The program will run for 5 Saturdays as follows:  November 3rd, 2018,   December 1st, 
2018,  January 5th, 2019,  February 2nd, 2019, and April. 6th, 2019.  We will hold February 9th, 
2019 and April 13th, 2019 as alternate dates, as needed.  The program will run from 8:30 AM to 
1:00 PM.  Instruction will be delivered in English, using ENL methodologies.  The model of the 
instructional program for ELLs this year will be based on “Bridging the Gap Between Home and 
School Language Acquisition”.  The thematic unit this year will be "Under the Sea". Instruction 
will be aligned to the Bilingual Progressions,  and the NYS Common Core Standards Reading 
1,  Speaking and Listening 1.  30 ELLs from all proficiency levels of performance, will be 
invited to attend the program in one 12:1:4 class (grades K-2), one 6:1:1 class (grades 2-4) and 
one 12:1:1 configuration (grades 7-9).  The program includes students in grades K-4 and 7-9, 
inviting former Title III attendees to once again act as mentors for the younger grades. One 
TESOL teacher and three Special Education teachers (2 of whom that have formal with training 
in Universal Design for Learning techniques and strategies) will provide direct instruction to all 
of the ELL students whom attend the Saturday program, with the assistance of 1 Guidance 
Counselor and 10 bilingual paraprofessionals (2 Bengali/Urdu, 1 Mandarin/Cantonese, 1 Haitian-
Creole, 1 Hindi, and 1 Spanish-speaking. ias well as 4 more bilingual paraprofessionals that will 
be provided to four of our ELLs whom are mandated 1:1 behavioral and health 
paraprofessionals). The TESOL teacher and special education teachers will be using a guitar, 
laptops, ipads, ipad minis, device chargers, flash drives, digital cameras, media projectors, 
wireless microphone systems, rhythm instruments, AAC Devices, art supplies, socialization 
games, flannel boards, manipulatives, dry erase boards, yoga mats, Ocean Life books, CD-Rs, 
and  the  Look, Listen and Speak Ocean kits (and related materials) to support instruction. 
Our third special education teacher with  considerable knowledge in working with hands on 
technology will also work collaboratively with the TESOL teacher and UDL specialists. This 
teacher will facilitate instruction and provide assistance by helping students, parents, and 
teachers to design, program, and utilize Augmentative Alternative Communication systems 
(AAC)  devices and materials. The 2 respective UDL specialists and third special education 
teacher will be proficient in communicating in Hindi, Urdu,  Chinese and Spanish to support the 
demographic growth in the language based needs of our Title III attendees and P993Q's growing 
population of ELLs. With the facilitation of one guidance counselor, the program will coordinate 
parent network groups, PBIS strategies and techniques, and available resources for parents of 
ELLs. Parents will work along side their youngsters and engage in hands-on activities. For that 
reason, 10 bilingual paraprofessionals will be employed in the instructional program to provide 
native language support for students and to serve as interpreters for parents who speak the 
various languages. The licensed and permanently certified TESOL teacher and 
licensed/provisionally certified Special Education teachers are qualified in the 
following:  Teaching English to Speakers of other Languages (TESOL), Special Education 
Grades K-12, and have a combined thirty+ years in ENL and  Special Education as well. The

and motivating. Lessons will be delivered using various methods of presentation such as whole 
language, movement, and the use of multimedia and music based instruction. Various AAC 
devices will be used to support development of receptive and expressive communication skills. 
The TESOL, UDL specialists, and hands on technology teachers will utilize multimedia, 
instructional software, ebooks, and related hardware to support the supplemental Saturday 
instructional program. Technology-based hardware such as Smart Boards, ELMO visual 
presenters, multimedia projectors, bluray players, digital cameras, lap tops, AAC devices, color 
printers, microphones, and internet access will be utilized to support instruction. Ipads and 
ipad minis will be used to record and scrutinize student dialogue in verbal and language 
emergent students.  I Talk apps and other English Learning tool services will be downloaded 
onto these devices as part of our instruction to aid students in learning English. “Bridging the 
Gap Between Home and School Language Acquisition” was selected as the model for our 
Saturday supplemental instructional program. Research shows that involved parents enhance the 
skills of ELLs as they are connected to the home-school community. In addition, after reviewing 
IEP goals, student work, and NYSESLAT scores, the TESOL teacher will submit a needs 
assessment to the principal. Data based on this needs assessment showed that additional 
instruction was needed across all language acquisition areas: listening, speaking, reading, and 
writing.  Curriculum and lessons will be developed to engage students, parents, and family 
members in the process of generalizing ENL skills in school, at home, and in the community. 
Appropriate translation/interpretation paraprofessionals will be available. P993Q site is 
accessible for students/families with disabilities. Communication devices will be available to 
facilitate communication for students.The Saturday supplemental instructional institute will 
enhance language instruction based on the use of informational text and real world 
applications.  ELLs perform better when parents are involved in their education (B. Harry, 2004; 
J. Cummins, 1984). In addition, instruction that includes strategies (e.g., Cognitive Academic 
Language Learning Approach) that address cognitive and academic language needs for ELLs and 
is communication-focused is also supported by research (Chamot & O’Mally, 1994); Dulay, H., 
Burt, M. & Krashen, S. (1982), Krashen, S. (2006); Baca, L. (1991). Technology will be 
integrated into instruction during the Saturday instructional program at 993Q. Research has also 
shown that technology can be used to enhance teaching and learning in schools (Fisher, Dwyer, 
and Yocam, 1996; Cummins and Sayers, 1997). Researchers report that technology motivates 
students, encourages them to take ownership of their own work, builds metacognitive skills, 
provides students with access to other cultures, and enhances classrooms as centers of inquiry, 
exploration and literacy (Toppings, K., 1998).

Part C Professional Development 
Mr. Leigh Eisenberg (ENL teacher from P993Q), Ms. Katy Upegui (technology specialist from 
P993Q), Ms. Ghyoor Sultana (UDL/Data specialist from P993Q) and Ms. Kathy Chan 
(UDL specialist from P993Q) will provide professional development to  all Title III 
staff members including themselves, paraprofessionals, and principal. The ENL teacher will 
provide professional development in New Language Arts Progressions (NLAP) and the ELL 
Identification Process, The UDL specialist will provide training in the Universal Design for 
Learning paradigm. The data specialist will provide training on using data to measure student 
growth, and Ms. Katy Upegui will be providing professional development on  integrating 
technology skills with children in the 12:1:4 population (reflecting an area of  growth in both 
school based and Title III attendee populations). The staffing ratio supports 10% professional 
development.  Further topics will include: alignment of instruction to the CCLS--Reading 
1,  Speaking and Listening 1 and Bilingual Progressions, using informational text as it applies to 
real life situations; the role of the bilingual paraprofessional as part of the instructional team, the 
use of technology to stimulate and support communication and socialization in ELLs, making 
picture symbols, making dual language symbols, how to build digital photo libraries, and putting 
theory into practice to elicit language from our ELLs. Data based on our needs assessment 
showed that additional instruction was needed across all language acquisition areas: listening, 
speaking, reading, and writing.  The objectives of the PDs are geared toward training staff about 
the  Bilingual Progressions and Reading 1, Speaking and Listening 1 of the CCLS. Staff will also 
be trained on how to provide translation and interpretation services to a large ELL population. 
Staff need to be familiar with and adept in the use of AAC technology in order to facilitate 
communication. PD will take place once a week on Fridays for 5 weeks from 2:35PM to 
3:35PM.

 Part D: Parental Engagement Activities 
There is a high level of communication with ELL parents throughout the school 
community.  Supporting the ENL program is strong collaboration between the Parent 
Association and Parent Coordinator resulting in ongoing family activities, cultural events, and 
workshops that provide opportunities for social interaction, exposure to information on the 
Saturday Institute, and supports outside the school community.  At the start of each Title III 
workshop, parents engage in family networking activities. Parents then work along side their 
youngsters and engage in hands-on activities. Parents will be given PDF based teacher created 
instructional materials to be used at home with their children which will be downloaded on 
external thumb drives which they will be receiving. Parents will learn how to choose from and 
utilize various forms of scaffolds needed to help their children succeed. Parents will learn how to 
use AAC devices and ELL based materials to generalize targeted communication skills. ELL 
parents are also made aware of CBO's and work program opportunities as part of transition 
planning for middle and high school students.  Parents of ELLs attending the Title III Saturday 
Institute  provide feedback after each session. Responses are evaluated for concerns and 
suggestions in generalizing listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills at home and in the 
community. Printed materials are distributed in native languages as well to inform all parents in 
school techniques and strategies that can be utilized and practiced at home.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The Schoolnet BOY and EOY  are used to assess early literacy skills of our Standardized ELLs  and Scantron Performance Series 
is used for our students grades 3-8.  Alternate Assessments students are measured using SANDI/FAST.  In addition, all ELLs 
(alternate or standard assessment )are given NYSI TELL and NYSESLAT and are further assessed using teacher created 
assessments and the LAP tool kit.  The data shows that our students strengths are in the areas of Listening and Speaking.  This 
data will be used to drive instruction and help our school's planning and scheduling as per CR-Part 154.               
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Administrators ensure that teachers are trained in ENL services during extended day, collaborative teacher meetings, and 
professional development opportunities. ENL Compliance Liaison is available to assist all classroom and ENL teachers in 
modifying assignments to meet the needs of ENL students.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our programs for ELLs is determined by a monthly inquiry meeting where we analyze data tracking sheets that 
monitor the progress of our ELLs based on their IEP annual goals. At these meetings,  particular attention is paid to NYSESLAT 
scores from previous years to track student progress. We learned that most students are at the Entering proficiency level, but 
they do progress over their duration at P993Q into the Commanding proficiency level.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Data specialists create an itemized analysis of testing data that show a student's area of strength and deficiency. Teachers use 
this information to guide lesson planning and adjust learning for ENL students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
While P993 does not participate in the RTI program, an AIS teacher is available to provide services to all struggling students 
and interventions decrease over time as students progress.  Our school uses data from formal assessments to drive rigorous 
and culturally responsive instruction.  Language development at all levels is fostered through purposeful, deliberate 
conversations between teacher and students, and among students. Reading and writing is taught as specific curricula, and 
integrated into each content area. Our program adds layers of instructional support to the standard core curriculum delivered 
in a school, based on the demonstrated and changing needs of the student learners. This includes levels of intervention and 
instruction that increase in duration and intensity over time. As students improve, measured by reliable and valid assessments, 
the extra supports are removed.  Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) are an integral part of classroom 
instruction. Our objective is to use characteristics of these approaches to meet the needs of children experiencing academic 
and social difficulties in school. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns reveal that while most students are on the  Entering Level, they do move towards the Commanding 
proficiency. Data shows that most students, but not all,  in grades K-12 remain at the Entering proficiency level. Some students 
do reach the Commanding proficiency level over time on a standardized test given to alternate assessment students. The 
breakdown is as follows:  147 Entering, 11 Emerging, 7 Transitioning,  5 Expanding, and 7 Commanding students.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

ATS reports are provided to ENL Compliance Liaison to be carefully examined and distributed to all pertinent staff for review. 
Academic focus will be placed in the areas of deficiency to improve scores on state testing. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1. Both integrated/standalone models are utilized for ELLs at P993Q.  Both models are used as per CR 154.2 while 
simultaneously ensuring student safety,  IEP compliance, and  implemented based on site specific needs.  A 
heterogeneous grouping model is in place to deliver services for all proficiency levels.  P993Q implements  the 
Freestanding ENL program exclusively. As a result, ENL teachers evaluate data and schedule instruction at specific 
sites where there are students mandated to receive ENL services. Students are grouped by ratio, grade, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

proficiency level. Students are served in self-contained classrooms; integrated via co-teaching between ENL, 
classroom teachers, cluster teachers and related service providers. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

993Q does not have any TBE programs at this time. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

993Q does not have any DL programs at this time. 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

        ENL schedules reflect compliance with CR-Part 154 to the greatest extent possible and are tracked through STARS. P 993Q 
ENL teachers push in to classes whose student-teacher-paraprofessional ratios include 12:1:4, 12:1:1, 8:1:1, 6:1:1, and 
inclusion settings. These respective ratios and student ages are always considered and maintained in order to best ensure 
student safety and optimal learning conditions for ENL instruction delivery therefore Instructional minutes include lessons 
based on  ENL, NLA, and HLA standards that meet the needs of the special education ELLs at P993Q. Therefore, all these above 
subcategories are delivered mandated instructional minutes in each program model. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
     Within the Freestanding ENL model, content-based instruction is delivered primarily using CALLA (Cognitive Academic 
Language Learning Approach) that integrates academic learning strategies needed to function in all-English classrooms. In 
addition, TPR (Total Physical Response) uses movement to foster language development and facilitate 
comprehension.  Lessons are aligned with the pacing calendar, and reading, writing, listening and speaking activities are 
incorporated into lessons across all content areas. Key vocabulary is emphasized throughout the lesson and the teacher 
provides oral and written previews and reviews. Our teachers devote adequate time to teaching content objectives and 
language objectives with the focus of building language-related skills and competencies that English learners need in order to 
comprehend the content. We do this to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core Learning 
Standards.  ELLs with autism will learn vocabulary through the use of icons with large pictures and a small word, icons with a 
small picture and large words, or just the printed word with the definition written out. These words are taught/re-taught and 
maintained using behavioral techniques. Group activities are planned to encourage collaboration and peer 
interaction.  Academic discussion techniques are differentiated according each students’ verbal communication style. Teachers 
will model sentences encouraging ELLs to focus on the content and not the structure. Students are encouraged to organize and 
express their thoughts in written/symbol form  or verbally (i.e. speeches). The teacher serves as a coach encouraging students 
to be more explicit and to always have high expectations for their learning.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   4. Translators are made available to facilitate evaluations.   ELLs and families of ELLs are formally and informally interviewed 
in their native language. Informal evaluations are also done by AP paraprofessionals and other bilingual staff members under 
the guidance of trained pedagogues. The Spanish LAB is administered to students whose home language is Spanish if they do 
not test at Commanding on the NYSITELL.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

5a. The instructional plan for SIFE includes small group and one to one tutoring, community awareness activities and AIS 
services.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

5b. Newcomers also receive small group and individual instruction along with community awareness activities to familiarize 
students with ENL methodologies. Instruction for students requiring ELA testing will align with ELA standards, have 
accommodations applied, and utilize ENL methodologies in preparation for assessments.  
5c. Instructional plans for ELLs receiving services 4 to 6 years include the use of technology, music, movement, and 
augmentative communication devices to help students meet IEP goals. When appropriate, ELLs will participate in transition 
programs preparing them roles in the community. 
5d. Instruction for long-term ELLs will continue to include transition programs and skills to prepare them for college/career 
readiness. Long-term ELLs are entitled to all AIS services and will be scheduled to receive them at their respective sites.  
5e. For former ELLs in years one and two, after testing at Commanding some transitional support activities that the schools 
provide include all ELL testing acomodations, participation in Title III,  continued support from the ENL teachers. All former 
ELLs are also given 90 minutes of instruction per week.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Instruction is differentiated for all students using both ENL and special education programs and methodologies. These include 
but are not limited to: The Natural Approach, which utilizes strategies that provide positive and accepting environments, 
concepts made comprehensible through visuals and objects, and little overt correcting of language errors. The Picture 
Exchange Communication System (PECS)-a system that uses pictures to initiate and facilitate communication for language 
emergent students is also utilized. Alternate placement paraprofessionals and bilingual service providers support 
differentiated instruction for students with mandates. As well as teaching content area based instruction ENL teachers spend 
time teaching Basic Interpersonal Communication skills. ENL teachers further adapt and modify existing curriculum, which may 
include Unique Learning Systems, ReadyGen, Attainment, SMILE, Glencoe Science, EngageNY Math, and Go Math. ENL 
schedules reflect compliance with CR-Part 154 to the greatest extent possible. ELLs are grouped according to classification, 
grade level, and English proficiency levels. ENL teachers, classroom teachers, and related service providers meet regularly in 
order to create and implement schedules that do not conflict within the confines of the current SESIS system.:    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 The Integrated model allows ENL teachers to maximize delivery of service for ELL-SWDs.  As per state mandates, all special 
education Limited English Proficient students are served according to IEP goals and each student is administered the 
NYSESLAT. ELLs participate in non-gradable programs. ELLs contribute to weekend programs in which family, friends and peers 
are invited. They also participate with non-disabled peers in assemblies through Project Arts and Science Fairs. Our inclusion 
model is another way we ensure participation with non-disabled peers. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 All intervention services are offered in English only as part of the Freestanding ENL Program at P993Q. Most of the ELLs at 
993Q fall within the Entering and Emerging levels of English proficiency due to the nature of the students' disabilities. Sub-
groups are identified by staffing ratio, such as 12:1:1, 12:1:4, 6:1:1, and 8:1:1 and disabilities ranging from learning disabled, 
emotionally disturbed, students on the autistic spectrum, and severely cognitively and health impaired. The purchase a 
continued reading and writing program entitled, "First Author" will ensure that students learn the correct writing formats used 
on standardized testing. Math intervention for these subgroups include Go Math, Attainment, and Unique. Students will 
continue to take practice exams on state approved computer programs, such as, Scantron Performance Series, School 
Performance Tasks and Schoolnet texts. Exams are ordered in a student's native language as based on availability and 
modifications are applied during testing windows. Teachers use testing data to modify assignments in all areas of the 
curriculum. Translation services are provided when needed.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

First Author will be continued with existing curricula; Attainment will be expanded to the upper grades. P993Q will use teacher 
created rubrics that show rigor to ensure that IEP goals are being monitored. ELSB literacy program was also purchased for 
younger grades. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

993Q has not had any bilingual programs, thus we have had none that require closing. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELLs at P993Q are encouraged to participate in school-based activities such as trips, shows, and athletic events. High school 
age ELLs participate in School to Work transitional programs in the community at large.  
ENL teachers, classroom teachers, counselors, and alternate placement paraprofessionals support high school age ELLs in 
these types of transitional programs. The Title III Saturday Institute is open to all ENL mandated students. This program offers 
educational support across the four modalities of the NYSESLAT exam in a non-classroom setting.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials and technology utilized with subgroups of ELLs on the autistic spectrum and severely cognitively 
impaired are Smart Boards, ELMO Visual Presenters, ipads, multi-media projectors, audio speakers, portable voice recorders, 
portable media centers, cinema screens, touch screens, digital cameras, mobile laptop carts, color printers, and internet access 
in all classes. Instruction is supported by the use of Alternative Augmentative Communication devices (AAC) that include single, 
two and three button communication devices, BIG MACS, Dynavox V, Dynavox VMax, and Dynavox Maestro.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 In our ENL program, Home language is supported by the use of bilingual Picture Exchange Communication Symbols (PECS).  It 
is delivered to all ELLs that are mandated to receive ENL services. Alternate placement paraprofessionals are assigned to 
Bilingual mandated students as an interim service when appropriate bilingual programs are not available. Multi-lingual libraries 
are in place and available to ELLs in all classes. Dual language “We Are New York” books from former Mayor Bloomberg’s office 
are in the middle school and high school classes. ENL teachers collaborate with related service providers (speech, guidance, PT, 
OT) to apply IEP mandated adaptations and modifications during instruction. Native language support is systemic and not 
limited to the ENL classroom.  In addition to glossaries, dictionaries, and materials in the native languages, school 
personnel provide support to ELLs during the school day to for clarification as needed in subject- area classes. Teachers can 
group students of the same language for certain activities so that they can assist each other and respond in the native 
language. Each of these strategies extends through our Title III program.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ENL teachers collaborate with related service providers (speech, guidance, PT, OT) to apply IEP mandated adaptations and 
modifications during instruction. Collaboration with classroom teachers takes place to ensure age and grade level appropriate 
instruction is delivered in the following ways:  ENL and teacher collaborative team meetings, review from data specialist and 
analyze IEP and baseline, midyear and end-of-year data. Core curriculum and related materials are modified to meet the 
functional levels of all ELLs. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Instructional materials and technology utilized with subgroups of ELLs on the autistic spectrum and severely cognitively 
impaired are Smart Boards, ELMO Visual Presenters, ipads, multi-media projectors, audio speakers, portable voice recorders, 
portable media centers, cinema screens, touch screens, digital cameras, mobile laptop carts, color printers, and internet access 
in all classes. Instruction is supported by the use of Alternative Augmentative Communication devices (AAC) that include single, 
two and three button communication devices, BIG MACS, Dynavox V, Dynavox VMax, and Dynavox Maestro. Common Core 
Curriculum materials are ordered on a site by site basis in order to best meet the needs of each given population within each 
respective site. All shared spaces are utilized within P993Q sites. Integrated activities and events are coordinated between 
building and District 75 programs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs and those enrolled during the school year are invited to participate in the summer Chapter 683 program 
where they will receive instruction in by an ENL teacher,  special education teacher, paraprofessionals, guidance counselor, PT 
and OT staff.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 P993Q currently does not offer language electives to high school age ELLs at this time.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 At this time, P993Q does not offer dual language programs   
 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
ENL teachers attend all District 75 and DOE compliance meetings. Information is turn-keyed with the ENL Team and time lines 
for implementation are developed. ENL teachers attend workshops and participate in webinars pertaining to ENL compliance 
and curriculum at the District 75 and citywide levels. Information is shared with all members of the ENL team. ENL teachers 
turn key updated 993Q ELL information and data to the District 75 Director of English Language Learners and District ENL 
Coaches on a regular and as needed basis. Attendance at all professional development workshops is posted monthly and 
tracked for compliance purposes. All ELL providers are members of an ENL focus group which meets monthly.  Through School 
Based Option (SBO) voting, 993Q provides professional development to its staff every Monday through Thursday via extended 
days. At these times, PD is provided to all staff regarding ELL compliance, identification, instruction, and assessment. PDs are 
offered to all staff in the areas of ELA/ Math instruction, Behavioral Assessment via Rethink Program for Paraprofessionals, 
Arts, Parent Outreach, and Autism. A PD calendar is distributed to all staff in the beginning of the school year. 
 Meeting agendas reflect recent professional development or training opportunities that align Common Core Learning 
Standards to ENL Instruction. Agendas and PDs are kept at each site with sign offs during extended day activities. Student work 
is evaluated and tracked for progress throughout the school year for growth in ENL modality areas during Danielson 
Framework meetings. Training in strategies to differentiate instruction for ELL-SWDs include the Universal Design for Learning 
and Depth Of Knowledge models. Through the integrated model, ENL teachers utilize these strategies with classroom teachers 
and paraprofessionals. Paraprofessionals working in the Title III Saturday Institute receive two hours a week of per session 
training in the curriculum, lessons, and methodologies needed at each session.      
    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
An ELL professional learning community composed of the school's 4 ENL teachers meet on a monthly basis to discuss all 
current on going policies and mandates for ELL compliance. An ENL Compliance Liaison is assigned to attend all district ELL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

Compliance meetings.  All information is turn keyed to provide adherence to mandates. All related service 
personnel provide assistance for ELLs transitioning from elementary to middle school and middle school to high school. 
Professional development is tracked through out the school year utilizing attendance sheets, agendas, and program 
evaluations. Data tracking sheets are shared with staff and maintained in the classroom data management systems. Data 
tracking sheets are also used during administrative cabinet meetings to identify next steps supporting ELL populations and 
special needs. As students transition from elementary to middle school, ENL strategies that are effective with each student are 
shared with staff in their new setting. Students transitioning to high school are prepared for community activities such as work 
programs using ENL supports and strategies. All P993Q sites keep agendas and sign offs for all meetings to ensure that ENL 
teachers receive ELL specific professional development. Frequent review of the continually updated ELL Policy and a 
Reference Guide is utilized to support ELL professional development. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Once a year, ENL teachers schedule parent teacher meetings (not including mandated parent orientation meetings) and DOE 
scheduled parent-teacher conferences to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language proficiency 
assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas. Translations are written and provided by trained 
pedagogues from the school or through DOE translation services. The school provides translations for parent/guardians of ELLs 
on an as needed basis. Translation and interpretation services are available through the the Translation and Interpretation unit 
within the NYC DOE.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
P 993Q's Title III Saturday Institute fosters ELL parent involvement to model instructional techniques that  benefit generalizing 
school based skills to the community. All records of annual individual meetings with ELL parents as well as outreach to ensure 
parent needs are accommodated and uploaded into SESIS, e.g., phone logs, data binders, anecdotals, meeting notes, parent 
coordinator logs, parent trainings and all the other parent interactions are uploaded into SESIS. The Parent Coordinator 
oversees the process to ensure compliance. The P993Q Parent Association is also headed by parents of ELLs; four members of 
the School Leadership Team are parents of ELLs. As a result, there is a high level of communication/training with ELL parents 
throughout the school community. Collaboration between the Parent Association and Parent Coordinator result in ongoing 
family activities, cultural events, and identified workshops that meet the needs of the ELL community. The Parent Coordinator 
works diligently to create networks amongst parents the support the ELL community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jacqueline Zaretsky, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The following data is used to identify the preferred home language of parents/guardians of students attending 
P993Q: 
* The Office for Family Engagement and Advocacy Language Identification Card that is sent home with students 
and is available on-line in our newsletter 
* Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
* Blackboard Connect Parent Outreach family survey section 
* Interviews with parents/guardians when student is enrolled 
* Continuous discussion with parents throughout the school year at all parent engagements 
Responses are analyzed for translation and interpretation needs for any future contact with families. Information 
is then verified in ATS and placed on emergency cards.
