Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 
It is our mission to provide the highest quality and the most individualized instruction that supports student choice 
within a rigorous curriculum. While allowing each individual to become college and career ready set forth by the 
common core standards, we are also developing students’ critical thinking skills that extend beyond the classroom 
walls. It is our firm belief that, during these crucial developmental years, our support will enable students to discover 
a passion for learning and develop intrinsic motivation by raising questions, risk-taking, problem-solving and 
synthesizing knowledge via real world applications. Through this journey, our students will refine their sense of self, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

and develop their ability to take ownership which will help them negotiate their place within society. This process will 
foster self-confidence, reflection and growth. By educating the whole child and germinating socio-emotional learning, 
we believe our children will be able to succeed in college and the work force collectively. Our mission can only be 
achieved by creating and maintaining a community where parents, students, teachers, staff and administrators are 
committed to this vision. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Middle School 101, the Edward R. Byrne School, is named after a 22 year old police officer who was killed in the line of 
duty while protecting his community from the perils of drugs. It is Officer Byrne’s memory that fuels every decision 
made on behalf of our student body. The administration and staff of M.S. 101 believe an unwavering commitment to 
rigorous education in concert with engaging extracurricular activities and community outreach programs are essential 
in supporting our students so they may become responsible, productive members of society. We have germinated 
partnerships with Broadway Junior, the New York Historical Society and Kips Bay. We also utilize our teachers and 
staff to provide our middle school students with extracurricular opportunities including but certainly not limited to 
the following—a boys and girls basketball team, a chess team, a cheerleading team, a track team, a debate squad, a 
drama club, a dance team and a history club.  

M.S. 101 is located in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx and serves approximately 500 students in grades six 
through eight. We share a campus with two other schools—P.S. 304 and P. 10. PS 304 is one of our feeder schools. 
For the past three years, we have articulated with PS 304 as well as our other two local feeder schools--PS 72 and PS 
14. Our teachers and their teachers collaborate in the spring with regard to incoming students. This provides our staff 
with more information about our incoming students. This process has proven to be very informative and maximizes 
instructional time in the fall. 

In terms of our school’s strengths, we offer Regents classes to 8th graders in Common Core English, Earth Science, 
Second Language Proficiency Spanish and Common Core Algebra. Our accomplishments include the implementation 
of a PBIS model which catalyzed a decrease in principals’ suspensions by 90% and level 4 incidents by 80%. We believe 
in the natural partnership between a dean of students and the school’s guidance counselor. They must work in 
tandem to germinate our students’ socio-emotional growth. To that end, they both work in conjunction with Astor, a 
mental health clinic/mobile response unit who work in our school on a weekly basis. Intention shapes our decisions 
here at MS 101. Our instructional focus is this: all students will be reading on or above grade level by the time they 
graduate 8th grade. To that end, we are in the full fidelity phase of the Middle School Quality Initiative model. Our 
school uses the Degrees of Reading Power as a normative assessment to diagnose students’ lexile levels, our school 
community is fully vested in Word Generation and we have implemented Responses to Interventions in the form of 
the Wilson Reading Program. 

With respect to our partnership with parents and families, we believe in visibility, approachability and transparency. 
Our teachers and staff use Pupil Path (skedula), an online grading system, to communicate with parents and provide 
families with windows to the school. Additionally, teachers, administrators and staff spearhead parent workshops 
every Monday within the classrooms. We recognize that parent involvement tends to nosedive in the middle school 
years. To counteract that trend, we host performances during PTA meetings. We also catalyze sociability and parental 
involvement via Parent’s Night Out. On Friday nights, throughout the school year, we facilitate guided activities in the 
school building (i.e. the gymnasium and cafeteria) to facilitate student sociability and parental goodwill! Our goal is 
for students and parents to view our school as a supportive community. 

Areas of celebration include our students’ growth on the New York State English Language Arts Test. Additionally, 
students showed marked progress between September 2015 and June 2018 on the Degrees of Reading Power test, 
9% (73% of 6 th grade students are at or above grade level; 82% of 6 th grade students made progress) of 6 th Grade 
students, 11% (79% of 7 th grade students are at or above grade level; 88% of 7 th grade students made progress) of 7 
th Grade students and 10% (70% of 8 th grade students are at or above grade level; 88% of 8 th grade students made

progress) of 8 th Grade. With respect to challenges, our focus area is mathematics. Students in the lowest third are not 
making progress as per the Middle School Quality Guide.  

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 27% of our students have I.E.P.s. 

3 - Self Contained Classes 

6 - ICT Classes 

4- SETSS Classes 

Within this population students have specific needs based on their IEP classiification: Learning Disabled, Emotional 
Disturbance, Autism, Speech/Language Impairment, and Other Health Impairments. In addition, these students 
receive support services, such as Speech/Language Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, and Counseling 
services.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

With respect to rigorous instruction, we have refined our implementation of the four writing units through our 
continued partnership with the Urban Institute of Mathematics, PS/MS 71 and Mott Hall in concert with our Lit Life 
consultant. We have improved our use of the Writers’ Pathway rubrics across content areas. We have collaborated 
with our National Training Network to develop mathematics professional learning teams aligned to the specific needs 
of our students. We have supported a fully developed approach in social studies with specificity to the Pathways 
curriculum. We have cultivated our partnerships with the New York Historical Society to create historian fellows.  

With specificity to the collaborative teachers’ component of the Framework, we have supported our teachers in 
strengthening their practice by providing timely, actionable feedback aligned to the Danielson Framework. We have 
cultivated teacher-leaders through refining our professional learning teams and showcasing our partnership with the

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

As per the 2017-18 Principal’s Practice Observation tool, our areas of celebration include that MS 101 has created 
curricula aligned to CCLS standards that build grade by grade and help prepare students for high school and beyond. 

The following is a more specific list of strengths listed in our school’s PPO: 

  Core Ready provides our teachers with units of study in reading and writing, augmented by the TC on-demand 

writing prompts for narrative, informational and argumentative essays. 

Science teachers use the NYCDOE scope and sequence to inform instruction. 

  The math curriculum is well-designed to prepare students for algebra. 
  Passports serves as the foundational piece of the social studies curriculum. 
 
  All MS 101 students receive arts instruction. 
 
  The principal has established routines and structures that support students learning such as the use of the 

Students receive instruction around the Algebra, Earth Science, Spanish and English Regents. 

“Flow of the Day” in all classes and “S.O.L.V.E.” in every math class. 

  There is evidence of differentiation. This is evidenced by the use of IXL, peer assessments, student discourse 

and portfolios. 

  A schoolwide emphasis on writing was evidenced by the plethora of student writing across content levels and 

grades. 

  The availability of classroom libraries in every classroom reinforces the importance of independent reading 

coupled with individualized conferences notes. 

  The principal has garnered numerous partnerships including but not limited to MSQI, NY Urban Debate 

League, New York Historical Society, Project Boost and NJHS. 

  The principal has partnered with “sister schools” to combine professional development and consultant 

services for teachers and staf. 

  There is a collaborative feel between MS 101 and PS 304, the collocated school. 
  The principal has clear system in place for gathering and analyzing data—including but not limited to the DRP, 

IXL and the MOSL. 

  The principal and assistant principal conduct cycles of observation with the principal focusing on new 

teachers. Feedback is concrete, timely and actionable. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

According to the 2016-2017 PPO feedback forms, administration must implement more refined protocols to capture 
in-class data. Additionally, administration should help reinforce deeper thinking by reviewing lessons and focusing on 
depth over breadth. MS 101 must improve math instruction by transitioning to the NTN KEMS curriculum. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, students in all grade levels will show a 3% increase in meeting proficiency levels as evidenced through 
student performance data on the 2019 New York State Mathematics Standardized Assessment.

With respect to the supportive environment aspect of the Framework for Great Schools, MS 101 has collaborated 
with Yale University’s Center for Emotional Intelligence . MS 101 has expanded opportunities to provide equity and 
access to more students with a specific focus on screened and specialized high schools. MS 101 has expanded 
opportunities to engage with the arts and cultural institutions by partnering with Carnegie Hall and Broadway Junior. 
According to the 2017-18 PPO, the principal has promulgated a culture of high expectations and respect. 

Moving forward, we will strengthen our collaboration with Yale University’s Center for Emotional Intelligence pilot, 
using the RULER approach to impact students in a positive way. Additionally, we will refine our partnership with 
Broadway Junior.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Relative to the Collaborative Teachers Framework, MS 101 builds capacity among teachers and teacher-leaders. 
Teachers collaborate around the Passport curriculum, National Training Network and Lit Life. Teachers work in cyclical 
professional learning teams to study both qualitative and quantitative data. Administration helps foster teacher 
capacity by strengthening pedagogy via concrete, actionable and concrete feedback. As per the 2017-18 PPO, the 
principal has nurtured a vibrant, caring community within the campus by fostering collaborations among co-located 
teachers (P10 and PS304). MS 101 has partnered with sister schools in the neighborhood to bolster pedagogy. We 
also articulate with incoming feeder schools 

Moving forward, we will continue to build capacity and leadership through our partnerships with LEAP and the New 
York Historical Society.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
 

By the end of the 2018-19 school year, the Advance Data will illustrate a 3% growth of the teachers improving one HEDI

According to both 2017-18 PPOs, MS 101’s strengths with respect to effective school leadership center on our 
collaborations with the Middle School Lit Life Cohort as well as NTN. The MS 101 teachers are part of the Social 
Studies Leadership Cohort. The principal is part of the Superintendent’s “Think Tank” to develop a school-wide culture 
of excellence in teaching and learning. The Assistant Principal attends the district AP Institutes, as part of the district-
wide approach to building a capacity and collaboration. 

Additionally, it was noted that the principal and assistant principal conduct timely, effective cycles of teacher 
observations. Moving forward, MS 101 will implement NTN with fidelity and continue to refine inter-school 
collaborations respective to Lit Life.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Edward R. Byrne, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

M.S. 101, The Edward R. Byrne School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement 
level, e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 
● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning 
and decision making in support of the education of their children; 
● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support 
and monitor their child’s progress; 
● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, 
and in languages that parents can understand; 
● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to 
improve outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between 
parents and other members of the school community;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 
school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 
● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 
allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting 
skills; 
● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 
strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 
● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, 
the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes 
providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership 
skills;  
● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and 
families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the 
assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school 
environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of 
events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the central office.; 
● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and 
support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  
● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., NCLB/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 
● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise 
parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their 
right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 
1118 and other applicable sections under the No Child Left Behind Act; 
● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of 
the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 
● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  
● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations 
and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
MS 101 uses the Degrees of Reading Power test, Wilson Just Words and Word Generation program  to assess students' literacy 
skills.  The DRP provides assesses students' lexile levels. Word Generation assessments  determine students' vocabulary 
acquisition and retention levels. Additionally, teachers assess students' writing levels via Word Generation essays. Wilson Just 
Words assessments, our RTI, help us monitor students' decoding skills. . This data informs planning by helping teachers 
determine whether ELLS need concentrated instruction in decoding, comprehension and/or vocabulary. 
Based on these results, teachers determine students’ independent reading level and guided reading level. We administer the 
Wilson Language Program’s follow-up tests to students who test more than a grade level below. This data helps teachers to 
assess students’ strengths, challenges and specific impediments with regard to reading. Teachers determine whether students 
need interventions in vocabulary, decoding, comprehension or all of the above. This data helps all teachers determine which 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

scaffolds ELLs students will need. Additionally, teachers use this data during the Strategic Reading Periods. 
In 2016-17, 3 of our ELLs,  3/9 scored at Level 1 on the ELA test, while 6 ELLs, 6/9, scored at Level 2. Out of the six ELLs who 
scored at Level 2, three Level 1 Former ELLs moved to Level 2. MS 101 has implemented Word Generation, a cross- content 
vocabulary retention program. It introduces ELLs to Tier 2 words—vocabulary they will encounter across subjects. Teachers 
use Word Generation to assess ELLs vocabulary acquisition in a variety of ways. They listen to students, read their writing and 
test their acquisition. 
Teachers also administer a benchmark writing assessment at the beginning of each unit.     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers use data benchmarks to support the effort. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our program by examining students' performance on the NYSESLAT, and other states tests, such as 
Math and ELA. We use in-class performance-based assessments such as oral reports, essays and unit tests to evaluate progress 
as well. We also use the DRP, Word Generation and Wilson assessments to monitor progress.      
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Grade level team evaluate multiple forms of data to address next steps. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
NA 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We do not administer the NYSITELL. With specificity to the NYSESLAT, these were the 2017 results: 1 Emerging, 1 Transitioning, 
4 Expanding and 2 Commanding. Data patterns indicate that our ELLS perform far better in listening, speaking and reading 
than they do in writing across the curriculum. ELLS students need concentrated instruction in vocabulary acquisition and 
writing.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs?

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Currently, we have ten ELLs and four Former ELLs falling under the two-year rule.All of them are in a freestanding 
program. We use an integrated model. Students are in flexible groups based on lexile level and speech. The ENL 
teacher pushes in content areas and integrates ENL strategies into the lesson plan and lesson activities.. She uses data 
to streamline instruction and determine which supports need to be implemented based on the lesson. Since we only 
have ten students, programming is fairly simple. Student groupings change. She pushes in the core subjects based on 
their level.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           To ensure that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels of our 
students we follow CR Part 154 guidelines. Specially, students at the Entering/Emerging levels are programmed for 3 units of 
instruction. Transitioning students are programmed for 2 units of instruction  and Expanding level ELLs are programmed for 1 
unit of instruction. Native support is provided through the use of technology, dictionaries and the buddy system. The SIT team 
in conjunction with the administrative team monitors instruction 
. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   All content is delivered in English. We use the integrated  model to scaffold students and catalyze rigor. The ELLs teacher 
provides supports as needed. The ENL teacher provides support through an integrated model. She provides scaffolds 
throughout the content areas and collaborates with content area teachers. Students use IPads during strategic reading 
periods, visual aids, graphic organizers and dictionaries. As per the CCLS, students read non-fiction and take part in close 
reading with scaffolds in place. They are provided with conversation stems to support accountable talk.  Teachers circulate to 
collect data and keep a log of how often students participate in classroom conversations and debates. Talking protocols are 
established for listening and speaking in each class. Students take the DRP to diagnose reading levels. Teachers administer 
running record assessments and writing benchmarks to assess progress.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

              
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

For the schoo-year 2017-18, the ELLs subgroups are as follows: 3 Newcomers, 6 Developing, 1 Long-Term  and 4 Former 
ELLs.We provide glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, IPADs, peer partners, graphic organizers and visual aids for all categories of 
students. We differentiate based on three bodies of research: Brain-based research on learning, Learning Styles and Multiple 
Intelligences and Authentic Assessment. We plan our instruction around five steps:  1. Get to know the student. 2.Use various 
teaching strategies. 3. Use a variety of instructional activities. 4. Ise alternate ways to evaluate student progress.    
 
Newcomers work on basic and intermediate speaking, listening, reading and writing skills.Newly- arrived students  learn 
phonics and conversation is practiced everyday.Class participation, partner and echo reading are encouraged. Visuals and 
realia are used in lessons and sentence frames and templates are employed in speaking and writing. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
During the current school year, seven students  meet that criteria. Two students are in 12:1:1 setting, two are in 12:1 setting; 
while the remaining three are in ICT classrooms.  The ENL teacher pushes in and integrates ENL strategies into the lesson and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

lesson's activities. ELL-SWDs have access to the same content material in the various content areas, but differentiated through 
grouping, manner of delivery and product output.  All teachers are steeped in professional development to ensure they 
provide the proper scaffolds and modifications. Teachers and paraprofessionals are knowledgeable about students' IEP goals. 
ELLs are paired with non-Ell peers to catalyze English language acquisition.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  As per their IEPs, students are placed in the appropriate setting. Teachers plan according to students' IEP and ELLs goals. As 
per the aforementioned question, all ELL-SWDs join the general education students during enrichment, music, art, drama and 
physical education. They socialize with other students during lunch and school wide events. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
During our regular instructional day program, MS101 provides data-driven, intensive instruction in ELA ENL, math, science, and 
social studies through our intervention program offered before school. All subject area teachers give a pre- and post- unit 
assessment per unit of study. This data is collected, recorded, and analyzed daily, weekly, and monthly. Information from the 
data analysis is used weekly at our Professional Learning Team meeting to collaboratively decide upon strategies that will be 
developed, refined and implemented. During the school day, teachers provide academic intervention by differentiating 
instruction through process monitoring, station teaching and Guided Reading groups. As a professional assignment, some 
teachers have small group instruction, whereby they use a push-in/pull-out model in order to provide one-on-one or small 
group instruction. 
  
At-risk services include providing individual and group counseling, linking at-risk students to outside referral services and 
programs, and providing academic support through tutoring in small group or individualized instruction. Pupil 
Personnel/Academic Intervention Team meets biweekly to assess and track student progress. Based on analysis of patterns 
and trends, the Parent Coordinator in conjunction with the counselors provide parent workshops. 
  
All ELL subgroups are invited and encouraged to participate in our extended day program. During the regular day program, our 
SETSS, speech, and ENL teachers provide mandated services to our special  needs and ENL students. For all programs, 
instruction is in English with native language support as needed. Specifically, we utilize bilingual dictionaries, staff members 
and students who speak Spanish, Arabic and Albanian.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are not currently considering any new programs for the current school year. Our current ELL population is ten, we have 
four former ELLs this school year. In order to be able to effectively service both these populations, we have grouped them in 
the same classroom 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not anticipate discontinuing any of our current programs/services for ELLs.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our instructional programs have high levels of rigor and support to ensure all our students, ELLs and non-ELLs, achieve high 
academic achievement. By using the Integrated organizational model of instruction and the Block program model for our ELLs, 
we ensure that they are afforded equal access to all school programs, including technology. Our school is connected to the 
community-based organization, Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club. This organization provides home-work assistance, tutoring, and 
various sports activities for our students. Additionally, in the Spring our school offers test readiness classes after school in math 
and ELA to ensure that our students perform well.    
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials used to support ELLs are the same as the content educational materials used for non-ELLs. Because 
we use the Integrated model, our ELLs have use of the same technology as our non-ELLs. Every classroom has two desk-top 
computers. Additionally, we have 4 lap top carts, each holding 30 lap tops. All of our classes have use of these lap tops. The 
specific instructional materials used are as follows: 
  
                                ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS - Core Ready Lit Life - Balanced Literacy  
                                MATH - NTN; KEMS 
                                SCIENCE - Glencoe Science:  Life Science 
                                SOCIAL STUDIES -  NYC Passports   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Our school offers a free-standing ENL program only. Native language support is delivered through bilingual dictionaries and the 
buddy system.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services such as counseling, SETTS, speech, and ENL as well as educational resources such as bilingual dictionaries, 
language development program for ELLs, and content area instructional resources correspond to our ELLs' ages and grade 
level:.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The instructional materials used to support ELLs are the same as the content educational materials used for non-ELLs. Because 
we use the Integrated model, our ELLs have use of the same technology as our non-ELLs. Every classroom has two desk-top 
computers. Additionally, we have 4 lap top carts, each holding 30 lap tops. All of our classes have use of these lap tops. The 
specific instructional materials used are as follows: 
  
                                ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS - Core Ready Lit Life - Balanced Literacy  
                                MATH - NTN; KEMS 
                                SCIENCE - Glencoe Science:  Life Science 
                                SOCIAL STUDIES -  NYC Passports 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The school has a new parent orientation in June for all incoming families. The Parent Coordinator, ESL teacher, school 
administration, guidance counselor and ELLs secretary meet with the ten families to ensure their involvement.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish - Grades 6, 7, 8   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ELLs liaison at the network provides professional development for all teachers. Additionally the ELLs teacher leads 
workshops regarding ELLs modifications. Since we only have ten ELLs here at MS 101, our pd is tailored to meet their needs. 
Ms. Dapul, our ENL teacher, meets with all staff including, the guidance counselor, paraprofessionals, teachers, administration, 
the parent coordinator, our special education team, the school psychologist and all therapists throughout the year on her 
preparation periods to ensure that ELLs needs are being met. She keeps a log and monitors their progress. Because we only 
have ten ELLs, professional development sessions for ELLS can be streamlined. All teachers are ELLs teachers.    
The ELLs liaison at the Bronx Borough Office provides professional development for all teachers. Additionally the ELLs teacher 
leads workshops regarding ELLs modifications.     
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We use the various mental health professionals in the school to scaffold ELLs in their transitions- namely the guidance 
counselor, the on-site mental health clinic staff and the SAPIS worker. With the help of a translator, the guidance counselor, 
Parent Coordinator and ELLs instructor meets with ELLs families in September, right as students are beginning the sixth grade. 
Additionally, all sixth grade teachers meet with incoming fifth grade teachers in May to articulate about ELLS students. Notes 
are shared. Records kept regarding ELLS learners.    
The school secretary oversees all professional development records. We do not offer bilingual education. The district provides 
professional development for our ESL teacher. She leads teachers in tailored professional development regarding ELLS 
throughout the school year.   
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Since we only have ten ELLs, our ELLs teacher is able to communicate with parents regularly via Pupil Path telephone calls and 
meetings as needed.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We only have ten ELLs students. The Parent Coordinator serves as their liaison. The Parent Coordinator taps into the parents' 
interest. She invites them to volunteer at the school. Some of them serve as translators to other parents. Their families take 
part in workshops with the help of a translator if necessary.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Each September our pupil accounting secretary make sure that the home language of all students at MS 101 is 
disseminated to the administration and the Parent Coordinator. This information is gathered from the (HLIS), ATS 
reports and student emergency contact cards and the informal surveys conducted by our School Leadership 
Team. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
