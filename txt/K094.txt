Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We provide a safe and supportive environment where the students, parents, teachers and support staff form a 
community of learners. We are committed to achieving the highest standards of excellence through an academically 
rigorous curriculum for all students and through professional development for teachers. We provide students the 
opportunity to become active, caring, lifelong learners who demonstrate respect for themselves and others and have 
the capacity to participate in the world around them. P.S.94 prepares our students for college and career intellectual 
challenges focusing on the development of the whole child as an inquirer, both within and beyond the classroom. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

P.S.94 nurtures independent learning skills, encouraging every student to take responsibility for their learning and 
committed to developing inquisitive, critical thinkers who will embark on a lifelong journey of learning. We believe in 
the value of developing citizens who are proud of their cultural heritage and become bi-cultural as well as bi-literate. 
As the global economy continues to open the markets of all nations, it is extremely important that we provide our 
future generations with the tools that they need in order to strive in this new economy. It is our intention to assure 
that all of our students are offered the opportunity to become bi-cultural as well as bi-literate.  

 

To meet our mission, we are committed to… 

● Provide ALL students, within a safe, clean, and secure environment equal access to the curriculum which is an 
integration of academic and enrichment disciplines 

● Provide engaging, rigorous and coherent literacy curricula aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards  

● Provide engaging, rigorous and coherent mathematics curriculum to develop critical thinking through problem 
solving procedures  

We have established a comprehensive plan for high quality, international education that is set on five core values - 
Individual Responsibility, Respect for Diversity, Academic Achievement, Community Involvement, and Relevance to 
Our World. Our students’ pledge aim to develop internationally minded people who, recognizing their common 
humanity and shared guardianship of the planet help create a better and more peaceful world. ‘ P.S.94 is our school. 
We are here to learn and grow into independent global citizens . We will be respectful of our teachers and fellow 
students. We will be responsible learners by coming prepared for class every day. We will work hard and challenge 
ourselves to become creative leaders of our own learning.’  

We believe that our students learn best when they strive to be inquirers, knowledgeable, thinkers, open-minded, 
communicators, reflective, caring, principled, balanced and risk-takers.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
We are committed to achieving the highest standards of excellence through an academically rigorous curriculum for 
all students incorporating local and global issues into the curriculum, asking students to look at six related, trans-
disciplinary themes and to consider the links between them. The themes include ‘Who We Are’, ‘Where We Are in 
Place and Time’, ‘How We Express Ourselves’, ‘How the World Works’ ‘How We Organize Ourselves’ and ‘Sharing the 
Planet’. 

 

P. S. 94, The Henry Longfellow International School for Language and Culture is a K-5 elementary school located in 
Sunset Park, Brooklyn. We have a culturally and linguistically diverse student population of over 1363 students of 
which 53% are English Language Learners and 40% are former English Language Learners allowing us to offer Dual 
Language programs in Spanish and Chinese in grades K-5.  

 

P.S.94 aims to create a curriculum that is engaging, relevant, challenging and significant for all learners aligned to the 
Common Core Learning Standards. The curriculum is trans-disciplinary, meaning that it focuses on issues that go 
across subject areas. The curriculum is provided for students to apply their skills and knowledge to real world issues, 
to work collaboratively with peers, to be challenged and supported to complete tasks and to problem solve, to 
articulate their learning targets, self-monitor, self-correct and self-evaluate, to have an understanding of the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

assessments and rubrics used to measure their learning and to present their work, by doing, in a variety of formats, 
orally and in written form.  

PS 94 uses a thematic approach to teach literacy and language. In addition, we emphasize integrating language 
development through, science, technology, mathematics, social studies, music, and the arts. The school uses this 
approach to build the foundations of reading in early learners and provide teachers with tools for creating effective 
language and literacy environments in their classrooms. All teachers use several effective practices that help promote 
learning in students’ first and second language. In addition, teachers allocate time for the development of listening 
skills and oral comprehension through stories, songs, meetings, and discussions, promote natural oral interaction 
between peers in large and small groups through project base learning, collaborations, and presentations. 

In addition, students participate in the American Ballroom Theater Dancing, Lego Robotics, engineering, band, chorus, 
dance, visual arts, journalism, basketball, soccer, track and field and web design.  

At PS 94 we continue to increase parent engagement through various programs including Parent as Learning Partners, 
Family Math Night, Family Science Night, GED program, ESL classes, and workshops offered by staff, and various 
community and city agencies. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our student population is comprised of 53% English Language Learners, 40% former English Language Learners and 
8% are students with disabilities. Our students’ needs require a repertoire of learning strategies, including scaffolds in 
English and/ or native language (home language) where appropriate, to acquire English vocabulary throughout the 
content areas.  

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which our school PS 94 made the most progress over the past 
year were Collaborative Teachers, Supportive Environment, Rigorous Instruction, Strong Family-Community Ties and 
Trust. Our key area of focus for this school year continues to be to develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of 
beliefs about how students learn best. We will continue to ensure that teachers: 

  Use rubrics and reading and writing learning progressions to provide actionable and meaningful feedback to 

all students 

  Track student progress in all four modalities of language aligned to New York State Next Generation Learning 

Standards and content areas by using checklists, rubrics, beginning and end of unit assessments  

  Using current assessment to adjust curricula so that all students meet objectives and master grade level 

expectations 

  Teach strategies, including scaffolds in English and/ or home language where appropriate  
  Adapt curriculum to strategically provide multiple entry points and high-quality supports and extensions

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Although our school rating, as per the 2014-2015 Quality Review, in the area of Instructional Core 1.1., 1.2 and 2.2 
was proficient, there is still a need to focus on 1.2 which it is to develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of 
beliefs about how students learn best.  

This past school year 2017-2018 we provided professional development opportunities to incorporate the Danielson 
framework for teaching and the NGLS instructional shifts to improve teacher practice. Teachers received continuous 
support around the Danielson Framework: Domain 3: Instruction 3b-Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques, 
3c-Engaging Students in Learning and 3d-Using Assessment in Instruction. All teachers used the SIOP model to meet 
the language needs of all students .Teachers revisited strategies and scaffolds that would provide multiple entry 
points for all students, including English language learners and students with disabilities. 

In addition, as per the 2017-2018 Quality Review there is a need to align assessments to curricula, use on-going 
assessment and grading practices, and analyze information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional 
decisions at the team and classroom levels. Therefore, all teachers need to provide actionable feedback to students, 
or use what they have learned about student performance on common assessments to inform adjustments to future 
instruction. 

This school year 2018-2019 teachers will continue to use the SIOP model to meet the language needs of all students . 
Teachers will continue to revisit strategies and scaffolds that would provide multiple entry points for all students, 
including English language learners and students with disabilities. Track student progress in all four modalities of 
language aligned to New York State Next Generation Learning Standards and content areas by using checklists, 
rubrics, beginning and end of unit assessments Teachers will continue to ensure that deepened level of questions and 
opportunities of rich student led discussions are routinely provided to all students in all classrooms and content areas. 
Teacher and students will continue to use rubrics and reading and writing learning progressions to provide actionable 
and meaningful feedback to all students. Teachers will continue to use current assessment to adjust curricula so that 
all students meet objectives and master grade level expectations. They will continue to adapt curriculum to 
strategically provide multiple entry points and high-quality supports and extensions. Students’ needs will then be met, 
allowing them to produce meaningful work products, engage in challenging tasks and demonstrate high order 
thinking skills through discussions and written products.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 all teachers instructing English Language Arts will continue to implement targeted instructional content 
and language objectives, including scaffolds that will result in a 5% increase of all students, including English language 
learners and students with disabilities, as measured in ELA and NYSESLAT assessment and student work (portfolio).

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

This past school year 2017-2018, we focused on Domain 3 as the data form the teachers evaluation and the Danielson 
Framework demonstrated a need to concentrate in all of the Domain 3. Professional development and additional 
support was provided to ineffective and developing teachers. This school year 2018-2019 we will focus on Domain 3c 
with a deeper concentration on 3d. Our literacy and mathematics coaches will be conducting model lessons around 
Domain 3 to develop teacher pedagogy.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Henry Longfellow School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Henry Longfellow School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

The Henry Longfellow School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act 
(ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by 
Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Our journey at P.S. 94 has been a transformation for change. Our 2015-2016 ELA and 
NYSESLAT data indicated that our students needed additional scaffold support and 
differentiation in reading. In addition, we also needed to provide opportunities for students to 
develop their oral language skills. PS 94 researched an approach that would be inclusive and 
focused on supporting language. We will continue to learn and implement the Sheltered 
Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP) during the first and second grade reading intervention 
program as we believe this is the most effective way to incorporate the strongest elements of 
reading. SIOP language methodologies will be integrated during guided reading and small group 
instruction for first and second grade reading intervention students. Ultimately, the integration of 
the SIOP model will provide multiple pathways for students to participate and succeed 
academically with additional literacy language support in itemized knowledge, early reading 
strategies, decoding strategies, self-correction strategies monitoring reading strategies, using all 
sources of information to read, vocabulary development, fluency all in effort to improve reading 
comprehension of multiples sources of texts.Teachers will receive professional development to 
understand how to best support our English Language Learners and will be required to attend 
training sessions on Mondays from 2:20-3:50 p.m. Professional development will include SIOP 
training, administration and analysis of running records, guided reading and small group 
instruction in an effort to target the needs of English language learners.All agendas and 
attendance sheets will be kept in PS 94 Professional Development Binder.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  PS 94 recognizes that parents are our children’s first teachers.  Research shows that students 
who have involved parents outperform their peers academically. We are proud that our parents 
are active participants in the education of their child.  Parents are invited to join classes on 
educational trips throughout the year.  Parents participate in the first Friday of every month 
which they visit their child’s classroom and work on a special project, read or play math games 
and learn about language strategies to support our ELLs.  In addition to the scheduled parent-
teacher conferences, teachers meet with parents individually during their parent engagement 
block every Tuesday. Also, assistant Principal Gonzalez uses the AMAO tool to identify students 
at risks and uses that information to meet with parents and teachers to discuss ways to support 
those students' language development. Teachers and assistant principals offer workshops to 
parents to get a deeper understanding of our goals, our students’ language development, the 
different proficiency levels and ways to support language development for our ELLs at home. 
Parents are able to attend workshops in their preferred language along with information and 
resources about the workshop. We will also post the information on our website. Parents will be 
notified of the workshop through our school’s monthly calendar as well our teachers’ monthly 
newsletter to parents. Calendars and newsletters are sent home in the parents preferred language. 
We will also include information about the workshops in our school website which can be 
translated to our parents’ preferred language. Records of the agendas, attendance and handouts 
will be maintained in the parent communication binder in the main office. Copies of agendas, 
attendance, handouts and exit slips will be maintain in Ms. Gonzalez’s parent workshops binder 
as well. Workshops will be conducted in English, Spanish and Chinese as we will have 
translators and FM units available for parents to use and participate together during the 
workshop.

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

all ELLs students at risk and how they progress.   This data informs  our intstructional plan by completing periodic assessments 
that track our students progress as well as the support we provided per content, writing genre and reading. As we meet for 
inquiry we use the student work to analyze trends, strengths and struggle to then inform our teacher practice and student

learning.           
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Vertical team, Common Grade Meeting, Monday Professional development and instructional cycles of support with coaches, 
and 1-1 conversations.              
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use several methods to evaluate progress and measure the success of our programs. The standardized test such as the 
NYSELSLAT help us monitor and evaluate the success of our programs. The NYSESLAT data is informative as we use it to also 
plan additional tools and progress to provide opportunities for our ELLs to develop all four modalities of language. We analyze 
the data to ensure students are progressing in their language proficiency. Additionally, for the 2017-2018 school year, we 
adeministered the HLA performance tasks in Spanish for our grades k-5. We will use that data to monitor and evaluate the 
success of our Spanish Dual Language program. This data willl also inform us of the tools and support our studens may need to 
become biliterate and bilingual at PS 94. Moreover, feedback from our parents teachers and students.  Every year the demand 
for placement at 94 has grown and we are proud of the focused and comprehensive services provided to English Language 
Learners.  Our program has grown because students are successful in the program.  All teachers respect and recognize the 
importance of language and culture and are fully committed to preparing our students to become citizens of the 
world.  Parents recognize and appreciate all we do to ensure that every child leaves 94 ready for college.  Additionally our 
success can be seen by the feed back and recruitment we receive from neighboring junior high school.         
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Provide a Tier intervention program during the school day and after-school program for grades 1 to 5 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Students who are “at risk” or bottom third are identified using the results on leveled reading assessments (F&P), the results of 
writing on demand for grades k-5, the results of reading on demnad for grades 3-5,  weekly progress monitoring of all 
students, and state-wide tests. We also use the EDAT tool to identify students at risk. These students receive supplemental 
instruction, or interventions, delivered individually or in small groups during the student’s regular school day in the general 
education classroom. During that time, student progress is closely monitored. Students not making adequate progress in the 
regular classroom in Tier 1 are provided with more specifically-designed services. Our school provides reading recovery 
services for those students in the first grade and AIS for students in grades 2-5. Additional support is provided for grades 3-5 
during our Saturday Academy. These interventions are more intensive in nature and generally provided in small group settings. 
These services are provided in addition to instruction in the general curriculum. Students receive individualized, intensive 
interventions that target the student’s skill deficits. Students who do not respond to these targeted interventions are often 
referred for an initial special education evaluation. Data collected during Tiers 1, 2 and 3 are considered in making the 
eligibility decision. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
ELLs at PS 94 have shown great progress in the NYSESLAT. The number of Beginners/Entering has decreased compared to last 
year and the majority of Entering are first time tested students. In looking closely at the NYSITELL results, the majority of the 
students score higher in listening than speaking. We have a significant number of students who enroll in October – April many 
in grades 3-5.  These children are expected to take grade level content area exams and many are not literate in their home 
language making instruction challenging.  Teachers engage these students in authentic and real learning contexts that spark 
student interest through project based learning and language based learning.  We offer support to these students during, 
before and after school as the data indicates that these are the students that perform at Levels 1 & 2.  Further analysis by 
grade level teacher teams conducted in September indicates that although overall students are performing better in listening 
and speaking as expected; reading and writing has improved significantly in all grades.  Our results align with research on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

second language acquisition; our ELLs progressi within three to five years and as their academic language improves so does 
their performance in reading and writing.         
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Vertical Team Meetings, Monday professional development and grade meetings 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students receiving instruction in ENL classrooms receive ENL support all day from their classroom teacher. Classess 
are formed with students with different language proficiency levels and teachers provide differentiated instruction to 
support the language and academic development for all students. If there are Enlish Language Learners in our general 
Education Classroom, or in our ICT classrooms, we provide a ENL support following the SIOP Model, via a push in 
model, where an ENL teacher delivers language supportive instruction to the student in the classroom while the 
student receives instruction from the general education or special education teacher. This is a collaborative way of 
providing language support to students without the loss of classroom instructional and engaging learning time. The 
general education teacher or special education teacher along with the Push-In ENL teacher collaborate on curriculum 
and data analysis to target the needs of the students. The reading and writing progressions of the curriculum along 
with the New Language Arts Progressions are used to provide appropriate academic and developmental support to 
the students.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 
 
One of our goals at PS 94 is to   afford students the opportunity for high academic achievement while becoming   
bilingual, bi-literate, and multicultural.    We believe that these linguistic and cultural skills will enable them   to 
function more successfully in a global society.  We are strongly committed to providing our   ELLs with the skills they 
need to be academically successful.  Our guiding    mission is to increase the academic achievement of our English   
Language Learners.   To meet our   mission we have heterogeneously grouped classes in Dual Language Spanish and   
Chinese in grades Pre K-5 as well as self contained ENL and integrated ICT   classrooms in grades K-5.   Every   decision 
we make about the direction of our instruction is informed by the   assessment of what our diverse student 
population does well and what it needs   to improve. Our goals and objectives are designed to build upon the previous   
years of teaching and learning so we can focus on short term planning and   long term planning for growth and 
improvement every year. We continuously   compare our practice against best practices for gaps that give direction to   
our teaching and learning. Our weekly schedule and our flow of the day   reflect the mandated requirements from the 
CR Part 154 in terms of ENL   (standalone and integrated) and HLA.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 
 
In order to meet the linguistic   needs of our ELLs, parental choice and part 154 mandates, PS 94s Language   Allocation Policy 
will be as follows: Dual Language 50% English 50% Spanish   or Chinese, ENL Program Self Contained 100% English. All 
programs provide or   go above the Part 154 mandates of providing 360 minutes a week of ENL for   Entering and Emerging 
students; 180 to our Transitional and Expanding   students and 90 minutes a week to our Commanding students for two 
additional   years as per the new CR Part 154. All ELL students will receive 180 minutes a   week of Home Language Arts.   As 
soon   as  the NYSELAT scores are available,   we review the proficiency level of each child to ensure that they are   receiving 
the mandated minutes.  Since   all ELLs are in Dual Language Programs or self-contained ENL, the programming   is set by 
student needs and teachers are able to adjust instruction based on   proficiency levels of students.  In   addition, all instruction 
regardless of the content has a language objective. 
            
 
   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In the ENL self contained classrooms content areas are taught using  ENL methodology and strategies. In dual language classes, 
literacy skills are developed in both languages.  During the literacy block, the components of balanced reading program are 
introduced in both the students’ new language with appropriate scaffolds so entering students also have access to the 
curricula. Both ELLs and EP students receive literacy instruction in English and Spanish/Chinese daily.  During this time, 
teachers will schedule the various components of a balanced literacy program by language.  These components include 
readers workshop, read aloud, shared reading, word study, guided reading, independent reading, partner reading, and writing 
workshop.  Teachers will plan together to decide the scaffolds are needed to support both languages of instruction for social 
studies and science, and Mathematics.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Each grade team meets and together they analyze the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL results. Teachers collaborate and group students by 
proficiency levels to target instruction and meet with students in small groups. In a team-teaching approach, teachers must 
plan all instruction together in order to meet the academic and linguistic objectives of all the students. Students in the dual 
language classrooms are assessed periodically in both languages. To monitor the development of the home language, Sanish 
Dual programs used Fountas and Pinnell Reading benchmark assessments in Spanish. Additionally, our dual language teachers 
have created reading and writing assessments in the home language as well as Speaking and listening progress log to monitor 
and ensure that our ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language throught the year.            
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

All ELLs and former ELLs for up   to two years after testing out are eligible for ELL testing accommodations,   in addition to any 
accommodations on their IEPs or 504 Plans, if applicable. 
We will provide testing   accommodations to ELLs, as needed, on all NYS ELA and content-area assessments   (i.e., 
mathematics, science and social studies). We will ensure that all   necessary arrangements will be made to make these 
accommodations available   for ELLs who need them. 
            
 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our ELLs with special needs are provided instruction to ensure alignment to grade level standards and expectations as well as 
to meet the IEP goals.   We currently have 1  Dual Language Spanish ICT class, 4 Chinese ICT classes, 3 ESL ICT classes. These 
teachers are certified in Bilingual or ENL, Special Education and Common Branch.  They work closely with the grade level 
teachers to ensure the same learning opportunities are offered.  They scaffold instruction and provide small group instruction 
more frequently throughout the day.  In addition, they use intergrated co-teaching practices that are adjusted to meet student 
needs.  We also provide bilingual SETTS, Speech, OT and PT services to our ELLs.  Our guidance counselor and School based 
Support Team meets regularly to discuss the progress of students. Additionally all of our ELLs have access to Rosetta Stone a 
specialized language software. All classrrooms have desktops, a listening center and at least 5 ipads where students use 
Razkids for literacy support, Rosseta Stone for language support and curriculum aligned books on cd’s to promote language 
exposure as well as content specific vocabulary for our ELLs. For our native language portion we provide content area 
instruction in both languages. Teachers also use and share resources from engage ny and achieve the core as needed. Students 
are also provided with content aligned books in their home language. Finally, students also use the listening center with books 
in the native language. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ELLs/SWDs that are identified as in need of related services receive them as prescribed by their Individualized Educational 
Plan (IEP). In order for students to attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment, that are grouped 
according to their needs and abilities. Both the SETSS and the classroom teachers collaborate with the classroom teachers to 
ascertain the needs of the students to attain success.             
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered.

Our targeted intervention program   for ELLs include AIS intervention composed of English Language Arts, Math,   Science and 
Social Studies.   We have 1   Reading recovery Spanish Bilingual teacher who provides reading intervention   in Spanish and 
English to our early grade students.  We also have a test preparation program for   all students including ELLs that meets on 
Saturday for our Saturday   Academy.ELLs in the Dual Language program and ENL program in grades K-5   participate in before 
and  after school   programs that provide additional opportunities for students to develop heir   new and home 
languages.  They   receive  small group instruction in the   area of need.  Dual language and ENL   teachers that participate in 
the before and after school programs meet once a   month to re-organize groups based on student needs.  Additionally, ELLs 
also receive additional   help one-on-one or in small groups with their teacher or a bilingual   paraprofessional provide through 
the Bilingual Pupil Services program. We   select and implement proven research based interventions that are matched to   
students’ underlying needs. We collect formative baseline, mid-year, and   end-of-year data to ensure that we are on track 
with meeting our long-term   goals. Our interim assessments are administered, analyzed, and discussed   every six weeks 
during our weekly collaborative learning meetings. We also   provide extra help with language and grammar usage during our 
before and   after-school programs.   Home language   support is offered to our Dual Language and ENL students throughout 
the day   through the curriculum, materials and interventions.  Dual Language teachers support home   language development 
by teaching literacy in the home language first   depending on their language proficiency level of the students.  Home language 
support is provided through   all components of literacy.  The Dual   Language program hires teachers who are native speakers 
or fluent speakers to   reinforce ELLs mastery of their first language.  All students, starting in Kindergarten,   take books home 
in the home language to read independently.  Our ENL teachers  support home language development by   providing books in 
home language for students to take home and read with   their families.  Home language   dictionaries, glossaries and text 
books are also available in every   classroom. We strongly believe in respecting and recognizing the importance   of language 
and culture and are fully committed to preparing our students to   become citizens of the world.  
Students are taught according to   their age, grade level and language proficiency level. All ELL students   required services and 
resources corresponding to their age, grade level and   proficiency level.

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There were no programs discontinued.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Due to our large ELL's population the programs are available to our students. All students at PS 94 including ELLS have equal 
access to every program and are invited to participate in every program.    In addition, they participate in the American 
Ballroom Dancing, Lego Robotics program, band, chorus, dance and visual arts. Academic intervention services takes place 
before, during and after school day for students in grades K-5 in reading, mathematics, native language, science and social 
studies. ELLs are invited to participate in all activities at PS 94 and are provided access to the curricula by providing the proper 
scaffolds to support their learning. ELLs are also invited to participate in all of the after school programs that PS 94 offers to its 
student population such as band, chorus, dance, guitar, soccer and basketball.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We support our ELLs with specific  materials to support second language acquisition.  We all follow the SIOP model. All Dual  
language and ENL classes in grades K-5 use Rosetta Stones, and Raz Kids .Our Dual Language classes use 100 Book  Challenge in 
Spanish, Research Labs Spanish and Chinese, and home language  resources.  Curriculum materials such  as maps, charts, 
posters, and videos are available in English as well as in  other languages. Manipulatives for mathematics and science 
instruction are  also used. Fountas and Pinnell intervention systems are used as an intervention program. In addition,  our 
SETTS teacher uses SPIRE for intervention to support our ELLS during  one-to-one intervention in English.   
All classrooms have: 
•     Leveled classroom libraries that include   books and other printed materials 
•     Word Wall with pictures in the lower   grades and  content vocabulary with   pictures in all grades 
•     Multilingual and multicultural libraries

 In addition, all classrooms are   equipped with Smart Boards and Document cameras to enhance visual aspects of   learning for 
ELLs.  Our enrichment team   created and designed a STEM lab, that contain learning centers including a   technology center 
that have tasks with language strategies and modifications   to promote learning in Englsih and the native language.     
  
Home language support is offered   to our Dual Language and ENL students throughout the day through the   curriculum, 
materials and interventions.    Dual Language teachers support home language development by teaching   literacy in the home 
language.  Home   language support is provided through all components of the balanced literacy   model.  The Dual Language 
program hires   teachers who are home language speakers or fluent speakers to reinforce ELLs   mastery of their first 
language.  All   students, starting in Kindergarten, take books home in the home language to   read independently.  Our ENL   
teachers  support home language   development by providing books in home language for students to take home and   read 
with their families.  Home   language dictionaries, glossaries and text books are also in every classroom.   We strongly believe in 
respecting and recognizing the importance of language   and culture and are fully committed to preparing our students to 
become   citizens of the world.  
  
Students are taught according to   their age and grade level.  All ELL   students receive required services and resources 
corresponding to their age,   grade level and proficiency level. 
           
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The ELLs that are identified as in need of related services receive them as prescribed by their Individualized Educational Plan 
(IEP). Those students that do not have an IEP are reviewed by the Response to Intervention Team (RTI), where an educational 
action plan is developed based on age, grade, and proficiency levels. The action plans are reviewed every 6 weeks to 
determine its success and to create any necessary revisions. Home language support is provided throughout the day during 
content area such science, social studies and mathematics. Teacher provide support through the analysis of their language 
proficiency levels and through the home language arts progression to provide the proper scaffolds.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 
 
    At each age/grade level classroom teachers, through their curriculum, plan and develop appropriate scaffolds, tasks and

assessments to ensure students receive the appropriate resources.     In regards to SWDs all services are adapted and aligned 
to their Individualized Education Plan while being appropriate to their cognitive needs.      
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
In addition to Teachers College   Reading and Writing Workshop Model, we support our ELLs with specific   materials to 
support second language acquisition.  All Dual language and ENL classes in grades   K-5 use Raz Kids, Eureka Mathematics, 
Exemplars and National Geographic   Science.  Our Dual Language classes use   100 Book Challenge in Spanish, Research Labs 
Spanish and Chinese,  and home language resources.  Curriculum materials such as maps, charts,   posters, and videos are 
available in English as well as in other languages.   Manipulatives for mathematics and science instruction are also used. 
Fountas   and Pinnell intervention systems are used as an intervention program In   addition, our SETTS teacher uses SPIRE for 
intervention to support our ELLS   during one-to-one intervention in English.   
All classrooms have: 
•     Leveled classroom libraries that include   books and other printed materials 
•     Word Wall with pictures in the lower grades   and  content vocabulary with pictures   in all grades 
•     Multilingual and multicultural libraries 
•     Listening Centers 
•     Strategy and language charts related to   current unit of study in  Reading,   Writing  and Math 
•     Charts modeling correct language usage 
•     Flow of the Day with pictures 
•     Computers 
•     Laptops 
•     IPads 
  
  
In addition, all classrooms are   equipped with Smart Boards and Document cameras to enhance visual aspects of   learning for 
ELLs.  Our enrichment team   created and designed two STEM labs, that contain learning centers including a   technology 
center that have tasks with language strategies and modifications   to promote learning in Englsih and the native language.  
  
Home language support is offered   to our Dual Language and ENL students throughout the day through the   curriculum, 
materials and interventions.    Dual Language teachers support home language development by teaching   literacy in the home 
language first.    Home language support is provided through all components of the   balanced literacy model.  The Dual   
Language program hires teachers who are home language speakers or fluent   speakers to reinforce ELLs mastery of their first 
language.  All students, starting in Kindergarten,   take books home in the home language to read independently.  Our ENL 
teachers  support home language development by   providing books in home language for students to take home and read 
with   their families.  Home language   dictionaries, glossaries and text books are also in every classroom. We   strongly believe 
in respecting and recognizing the importance of language and   culture and are fully committed to preparing our students to 
become citizens   of the world.  
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELL students are assisted before the beginning of the school year through Back to School orientation, Open 
House, and the PTA offers ongoing events throghout the school year. We offer translations and translators to parents.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Our  Dual Language program is aligned to research based, developmentally  appropriate best practices 
and the curriculum is organized around major  concepts that students are expected to learn. As students 
move up in grade  the curriculum is increasingly more complex.     Our Dual Language program is designed 
to meet student needs and below  is a grade by grade program description.  
 
 Dual Language Spanish/English Models:   
-Side-by-side 
-Stand   Alone   
The   model we have per grade depends on the student population and the mount of   dual language 
classrooms we have per grade.   
Stand   Alone Teaching Configuration:    
Within   the stand alone configuration, there is one teacher who provides instruction   in both languages 
at separate times. The classroom contains instructional materials   in both languages and is organized so 
that the language of instruction is   clearly designated (i.e. color codes for language, signs indicating 
language   of day).  The teacher plans what   concepts and activities  s/he will   conduct in each of the 
languages. 
During   the literacy block, the components of the balanced reading program are   introduced in one 
language. For the remaining of the instructional day,   students will receive instruction in English and the 
home language following   the roller coster model, changing the language of every other day. 
  
Within   the team teaching configuration there are two classes that receive   instruction from two 
teachers.  One of   the two teachers in the team is assigned to provide instruction in English   and the 
other teacher to provide instruction in the other language.  In a team-teaching approach, the two   
teachers must plan all instruction together in order to meet the academic and   linguistic objectives of all 
the students.    There are two separate classrooms for instruction.  One English, the other in the students’   
home language (Spanish or Chinese). The two groups of students are   linguistically integrated; there are 
native speakers of English and native   speakers of Spanish or Chinese who are ELL as well as EP students 
within each   group.  The groups move from one   language classroom to the other. 
Literacy   Instruction: Simultaneous Literacy skills are developed in both   languages.  During the literacy 
block,   the components of the balanced reading program are introduced in theh new   language. Units of 
Study in Reading and Writing will be taught in English by   both teachers. For the remaining of the 
instructional day, teachers will   follow the side-by-side model where students will switch rooms every 
other   day. Both ELLs and EP students receive literacy instruction in English and   home language.  During 
this time,   teachers will schedule the various components of a balanced literacy program   by 
language.  These components include   readers workshop, read aloud, shared reading, word study, guided 
reading,   independent reading, partner reading, and writing workshop.   
 Both models of instruction in our Dual programs have equitable language policy of 50/50.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
 
Teachers receive professional development sessions to support English Language learners in the areas of language 
development, differentiation, scaffolds, instructional support, planning, the SIOP model and others to ensure all students have 
access to the curricula and lessons are aligned to the Next Generation Learning Standards. 
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
 
Our Professional Development committee works with the staff and administration to align professional development sessions 
with the ELL language development needs of our school. Beginning, teachers are surveyed and that information is used in 
conjunction with findings from student data and teacher observations to plan the support for our teachers. To ensure that we 
meet the requirements of CR Part 154.2, we will document all professional development sessions and instructional support 
provided through agendas and attendance. Specific activities include training workshops in and out of school building, lunch 
and learns, grade meetings and staff meetings are all geared to provide ELL language support. In addition to that we inquiry 
cycles to determine best ways to support ELLs. Designated recorders take informed notes with next steps. All notes are 
forwarded to all teachers. Records will be kept in the Assistants' Principal office.            
 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In addition  to the scheduled parent-teacher conferences, teachers meet with parents  individually during their parent 
engagement  block every Tuesday. Also, assistant Principal Gonzalez uses the EDAT tool to  identify students at risks and uses 
that information to meet with parents and  teachers to discuss ways to support those students' language development.  
Teachers and Assistant principals offer workshops to parents to get a deeper  understanding of our goals, our students 
language development, the different  proficiency levels and ways to support language development for our ELLs at   home.  
 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 
 
Our parents, especially those of   our ELL population, are a vital component to our students’ success;   therefore, we have 
designed activities to meet their needs. We gather   information based on informal and formal conversations between staff 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

and   parents, thorough our parent coordinators, parent surveys,  and from School Leadership Team (SLT)   meetings. We offer 
Monthly Parent Workshops are conducted to enhance   parenting and academic skills knowledge, as well as health issues. We 
also   offer workshops for parents of students newly admitted, and we provide   opportunities for representatives of the 
community to meet with parents at   our school. 
Every year we have plan multiple   one hour workshops for parents to come to the school and learn techniques to   help their 
children. These workshops will be held to assist parents in   supporting their ELLs at home. Workshops are conducted in 
English, Spanish,   and Chinese to ensure that all parents can actively participate and learn   from the workshops. Various 
techniques will be demonstrated to parents to   show them how to help their children learn English when they themselves do   
not speak English.  
  
The workshop notices will be   translated to accommodate the native language at home (English, Spanish,   Chinese). The 
translation services will be provided by parent volunteers and   several translating resources. 
 Topics for Workshops: 
1. Next Generation Standards and   How It Relates to English Language Learners 
2. How to support your child in   developing literacy skills. Reading With Your Child and the Benefits 
3. How can my child and I learn   English together 
4. Reading in the new language or   in the home language, what kind of questions do we ask our chikdren after   reading a book 
to improve language skills and comprehension 
  
Also parents come to our school   the first Friday of every month and visit their children's classroom for a   period as part of our 
Parents as Learning Partners. Teachers, parents and   students work together as parents learn strategies to support their ELLs   
academic development. 
            
 
  
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
 
 
Our Dual Language program is a   developmental, language enrichment, bilingual education program that   integrates students who 
are native English speakers and native speakers of   another language (Spanish or Chinese) for all or most of their content area   
instruction.  Therefore, the students   of each language group serve as language models for each other.  In addition, all students are 
developing   their second language skills while learning content knowledge in both   languages.  
  
We believe in the value of   developing citizens who are proud of their cultural heritage and become   bi-cultural as well as bi-
literate.  As   the global economy continues to open the markets of all nations, it is   extremely important that we provide our 
future generations with the tools   that they need in order to strive in this new economy.   One of our goals at PS 94 is to afford   
students the opportunity for high academic achievement while becoming   bilingual, bi-literate, and multicultural.    We believe that 
these linguistic and cultural skills will enable them   to function more successfully in a global society.    Upon their completion in the 
Dual   Language programs students in both language groups will: 
➢     Meet or exceed Next Generation Learning   Standards 
➢     Develop proficiency in their first   language (Home Language) 
➢     Develop proficiency in their second   language (English Language) 
➢     Develop positive cross-cultural   attitudes; behaviors, and skills that will help them function in a global   society. 
➢     Develop second language skills while   learning content knowledge in both languages. 
It is our intention to assure that all of our students are offered the opportunity to become bi-cultural as well as bi-literate.  We

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Janette Caban, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
