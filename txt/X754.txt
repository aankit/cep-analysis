Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

At 754X, we support all students to achieve by educating the whole child. Our school seeks to accommodate all 
learners in a safe and productive environment. We work to prepare our students for the world after graduation where 
they are expected to apply new learning, and to adjust to new situations. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

By being cognizant of the learning needs of each student, we incorporate the strategies and methodologies to support 
achievement. We provide a Standards based curriculum to all students, which offers multiple pathways to graduation, 
and transition to independent living. 

 
 In order to do this we welcome and celebrate all stakeholders, while emphasizing respect and collaboration, in a 
supportive, caring environment. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Jeffrey M. Rapport School for Career Development (754X) is a District 75 high school located in the heart of the 
South Bronx. The school provides services to a diverse populations of special needs students spanning the ages of 14-
21 years. We deliver academic, social-emotional, and transitional services to students with learning disabilities, 
intellectual disabilities, autism, and emotional behavioral disabilities. Students in our standard assessment program 
follow the traditional pathway toward graduation which includes the accumulation of credits and passing of 
Regents/RCT exams. Students in our alternate assessment program pursue the Skills and Achievement 
Commencement Credential. As such, these students receive educational, employment, and transition experiences 
which will serve them well as they proceed into adulthood. The majority of our students live in the area of the school 
which has historically been categorized as economically depressed. However, we do receive and welcome students 
from all across New York City. In order to support our students in achieveing at the highest levels, we know we must 
support the whole child. We currently have two iniaitives to support our students’ success. We utilize the Hochman 
Writing Program to provide scaffolds that will prepare our students to express themselves in written form. We have 
done this program for two years now, and we have seen student growth in-house and on regents exams. Our second 
initiative is the Resilient Scholars program, which will provide the social-emotional supports our students need to 
thrive in and outside our building. Without strategies and supports that address our students’ social-emotional needs, 
we will not meet our end goal of raising student achievement. We believe these two programs will continue to help us 
grow within our priority focus of student achievement.  

The following is the school’s Educational Vision: 

We are committed to providing students with the academic and social skills necessary to become productive citizens. 
We are dedicated to providing a rigorous and engaging curriculum that reflects the skills of a technology based 21st 
century workforce. As a community, we envision continual improvement of academic programs, social/emotional 
supports, pedagogy, and professional development.  

We post this in every classroom and in the halls, so students know our promise to them. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We are a District 75 special education high school. Our entire student body is comprised of students with IEPs. We 
serve students who have been classified as having emotional behavioral disabilities, learning disabilities, autism, and 
intellectual disabilities. Students receive supports based on their needs as stated in the IEP, which can include 
counseling and speech services. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As stated in the school’s Educational Vision, we are committed to providing students with the academic and social 
skills necessary to become productive citizens. We are dedicated to providing a rigorous and engaging curriculum that 
reflects the skills of a technology based 21st century workforce. As a community, we envision continual improvement 
of academic programs, social/emotional supports, pedagogy, and professional development. As a professional 
community always seeking to improve the educational experience for children, we also pay considerable attention to 
the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Below are ways we made progress over the past year, as related to the Framework for Great Schools: 

  Rigorous Instruction: Last year we greatly prioritized our direct writing program, Hochman Writing, in order to 

elevate student performance in class and on assessments. As a result, we saw increases in scores on our in-
house benchmark assessments. Our PD prioritized structure and audience, and we saw a 66% and 73% 
increase in those indicator scores. We also saw an increase in in the Part III essay on the ELA regents exam, 
which we had been a priority within our writing instruction. We also saw a large increase in passing Algebra 
scores, which was helped greatly by students completing more of the open response portions of the test. We 
will continue to prioritize this direct writing instruction as an integral part of instruction since it is part of our 
core values of how students learn best.  
Supportive Environment and Trust: We, as a community, have come to realize that without the establishment 
of relationships with students, we would be at a serious disadvantage in anything we attempted to do. 
Correspondingly, we sought to focus on the elements of Supportive Environment and Trust. As such, our 
previous goal was to increase the level of active participation from students in a shared decision making 
model. We earned a Well Developed in 1.4 and 3.4 in our 2017-2018 Quality Review, and our area of 
celebration was 1.4 where students were involved in the shared decision making with the Student Council.  

 

  Collaborative Teachers: At 754X, the professional learning and collaboration of teachers is extremely 

important. Based upon our Theory of Action for adult learning, teacher teams meet weekly in Professional 
Learning Communities. This year, collaborative planning and teacher teams will be the primary activity during 
teachers’ administrative periods. Since collaboration and teacher teams has always been a strength at 754X, 
we plan to capitalize on this and expand our teacher leadership in these PLCs and PD. We will continue to 
have our teacher leaders run the Humanities and STEM communities.  

  Effective School Leadership: Effective school leadership is essential in the successful development of all facets 
of the organization. In professional conversations with the administrative staff over the summer, we decided 
as a Cabinet to pay as much attention to this element of the Framework as possible. It starts each day by 
welcoming students into the building. All members of the Cabinet are present when students first enter the 
building. We build relationships. All members of our school are welcomed, valued, and respected to enhance 
the sense of inclusiveness, provide social/emotional support, and create the sense of connection to the school  
Strong Family Community Ties: We saw an increase in total parent participate in events from 2016-2017 to 
2017-2018. In 2016-2017 we had 171 parent sign-ins for school events. This increased dramatically in 2017-
2018 where we saw 375 parent sign-ins at school events. 

 

We have based our main priority focus for the year on our analysis of last year’s growth and struggles. We always 
need to root our goals in increasing student achievement. In order to achieve our goal, our priority focus for the year 
is centered on student ownership and feedback. We believe that if we hone in on this area, we will see an increase in 
student tenacity, and in turn, achievement. We have outlined, based on the Framework, how we plan to achieve this 
goal: 

 

  Rigorous Instruction: In order to continue our growth, we know we also need to focus on our students’ 
academic tenacity. Feedback on the 2017-2018 School survey indicated that teachers saw a gap in what 
students thought they could achieve and their academic output. In order to address these needs, we are 
building student conferencing blocks into all student schedules to ensure we focus directly on academic goal 
setting and action plans in order to build tenacity and improve achievement. 
Supportive Environment: This year we will be participating in the Resilient Scholars program within District 75. 
Our goal is to see improvements in students’ social emotional skills as evidenced through the DESSA and the 
Resilient Scholars program. We know that if we provide students with these social-emotional supports, they 
will possess more academic tenacity, which will help raise student achievement. 

 

  Collaborative Teachers: This year, teacher leaders will take on a more direct role in school initiatives and 

professional development. We will transition to 80% teacher-led professional development. We will measure 
teacher satisfaction with this teachers-leading-teachers model based on School Survey results. While this goal

is very teacher-centered, we believe that teachers that are excited about their own learning will help students 
become more excited to learn in class. 

  Effective School Leadership: . The Administration maintains an open-door policy with students, staff 

members, and families. The discussions held as a result of this policy lead to the achievement of students (via 
transcript analysis and personal and academic behaviors) and the development of teachers (via professional 
conversations and training opportunities). Thus, each day, the Administration is tied into the pulse of the 
school and the input of all members of the community is obtained. Building on our strengths, this year we will 
focus on high visibility, goal setting, and providing effective feedback, which mirrors what we want our 
teachers to focus on with students. If we model what we want to see in our teachers, we will see a greater 
impact for students tenacity and achievement. 
Strong Family Community Ties: In continuing to focus on the Framework, and based upon analysis of the NYC 
School Survey, it is readily apparent that the school needs to strengthen family and community ties. Thus, our 
goal in this element of the Framework is to increase parent participation in the educational and 
social/emotional aspects of each student’s High School career. The school seeks to increase this participation 
by 15% as compared to the previous school year. The meeting of this goal will be measured by attendance at 
Parent/Teacher conferences, parent participation at school-wide events, and an increase in the response rate 
on the NYC School Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Despite significant strides made in the delivery of instruction to students, student performance data on NYS 
examinations has not displayed the desired and corresponding results. After a thorough examination of NYS exams 
together with NYC Baseline Performance Assessments, the data revealed that students are making significant gains in 
the multiple choice portion of tests (35 percent growth); however, prior to 2017-18, over 90% of students are not 
attempting short response and/or extended writing response sections. By the end of the 2017-2018 school year, and 
after the implementation of Hochman writing, 100% of students attempted the constructed writing response section 
of the Regents! This data indicates that students are gaining in confidence and ability to recall information, write for 
extended periods of time, and demonstrate ability to master content-specific knowledge and skills. While we are 
seeing growth in this area, we will continue with our school-wide writing focus for many years to come.  

A new area of growth for 2018-19 is to cultivate student independence and persistence through a continued focus on 
growth mindset and academic tenacity. If we focus on this and establish all classrooms as growth-mindset zones, this 
will ultimately lead to greater movement LRE, which creates equitable opportunities for our students. We believe that 
a growth mindset should be practiced along with strong pedagogy and robust curriculum in order for all students to 
succeed and create a student-centered classroom. Mindsets heavily influence student performance; therefore, we are 
focusing our instructional efforts to build confidence, independence, and academic tenacity with difficult tasks since 
we know this will lead to an increase in student achievement. We recognize that independence looks different with 
our diverse student population, so we want to prioritize growth based on individual student starting points. 

At the end of 2017-2018, various stakeholders completed a comprehensive needs assessment. We examined our 
initiatives from the past three years and various types of student data to determine impact. The results of this 
assessment led us to our tenacity and independence focus. Work samples and quantitative data showed 
improvements for many students especially when they had high attendance. In order to get these results with all 
students, we see the need to focus on independence, perseverance and ownership to cultivate the tenacity all 
students need to succeed in a challenging, rigorous environment. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

By June 2019, all students who attend consistently (those students with attendance 70% and above who have been 
consistently enrolled) will show an increase in academic tenacity as demonstrated through a 10% increase in our 
independence tracking system and test attendance and score.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

*Cabinet meets to discuss vision for student conferencing period 
and considers school structures that would be needed to support 
implementation of a conferencing block. 

*Cabinet discusses citywide Equity and Excellence Initiative to 
ensure we are aligned. Since one of the goals is to have 80% of 
students graduating by 2026, we believe this conferencing and 
the transition period will help students be better prepare to plan 
for the future. 

*Instructional cabinet meets with administration to recommend 
potential protocols and procedures that will maximize 
productivity in conferencing period. 

*Cabinet finalizes Student Conferencing protocol and makes 
necessary scheduling changes to allow all students to get 
conferencing once per week. 

*Select teachers pilot the student conferencing protocols and 
collect evidence of student responses related to determined foci 
from previous action step. 

*Teacher leaders (or teachers present for summer school) share 
quantitative (rubric scores, test scores etc.) and qualitative 
(student questionnaires, work samples, etc.) with cabinet and 
make recommendations for revisions to the conferencing before 
it becomes a yearlong push. 

*Administration will review the data and engage in a reflection 
protocol using the Equity Toolkit from Colarado State. 
https://www.cde.state.co.us/postsecondary/equitytoolkit 

*Cabinet makes revisions, ensures all students are appropriately 
scheduled for a student conferencing period for Fall 2018. 

* Provide PD to staff on student conferencing period structure 
and share important findings from the previous year. Also share 
research-based rationale (specific focus on Gates Foundation 
report on academic tenacity).

*Teachers engage in weekly conferencing periods with their 
homeroom that focus on specific goal academic goal setting after 
examining student work (protocol and worksheet provided) and 
tenacity (protocol and rubric for tenacity and growth mindset 
provided). 

*Administration provides a schedule for mock regents testing 
during the year. Rationale – if we provide students with more 
opportunities/exposure to challenging work under a testing 
condition, they will be more prepared in January and June for the 
actual testing. This testing will only happen 2-3 times per year to 
avoid overkill and losing instructional time. 

*Assessment Team, which is comprised of a 50-50 split of 
alternate assessment and standard assessment teachers, meets 
to discuss metrics and tools to measure growth in independence 
and tenacity during the year. Alternate assessment sub-team 
works to define a metric to measure the growth in independence 
for students, and standardized sub-team begins by analyzing 
current practices in the school and where gradual release and 
independent time can be built into instruction to better prepare 
students for regents.

during the year. 

*Teachers meet in PLCs to discuss and reflect on student 
conferencing and feedback quality.

We will use a tenacity rubric (adapted from Eskola/NYC DOE resources) to quantify tenacity. We will analyze the 
results of January and June Regents to determine students tenacity and perseverance in testing. We will use the item-
analysis sheet provided by the district to support this analysis. Teachers will also utilize the rubric and goal setting 
sheets to monitor student progress on an ongoing, formative basis in their classes when engaging in a writing 
exercise. We will also use our independence tracking system that was developed by the assessment team to measure 
growth in classes that do not take a standardized test. 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
As indicated in the school’s Mission and Vision statements, the school is committed to providing a safe and productive 
environment which will allow students to succeed. The school provides a number of social/emotional supports that 
help to achieve our vision and keep incidents to a manageable level. These supports include a Positive Behavior 
Supports system, access to counseling, a dedicated crisis team, and an open-door policy to the Principal’s office. 
These supports enable the school to: 

-decrease the number of reportable incidents as the school year progresses 

- reduce the number of suspensions 

- solicit student voice through sit ins with the student counsel and quarterly school surveys. 

-provide a number of different student options 

Although this system of supports is in place, we are still scoring below the city averages in Supportive Environment, 
according to the 2017-18 NYC School Survey. Beginning Fall 2018, we will be rolling out the Resilient Scholars program 
as part of a District 75 initiative. This program will help strengthen the social emotional supports in classrooms and 
directly teach high priority skills, as determined by the curriculum. The program will be rolled out in all three 
academies/sites. 

 

This program will help directly teach into the skills required to build academic tenacity (our priority focus). Skills such 
as perseverance, self-control, time management, goal setting, etc. are all key components of both academic tenacity 
and the Resilient Scholars program. We believe this will help us with our end goal of improving student achievement 
and help students see their own role and control over their academic journey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the 2017 Quality Review (QR) report and the 2018 Principal Practice Observation data, one of our 
school's strength is in 4.1 (teacher support and supervision). When looking at the NYC School Survey, 754X scores 
higher than the city and district average in Quality of Professional Development and in several indicators within Peer 
Collaboration. Our systems and structures to support teacher collaboration and teacher leadership have been 
recognized as a strength in QRs and PPOs. We have done several things to prioritize this collaboration: 

*Strategic admin period scheduling to promote common planning time for department and grade teams. 

* Teacher Leadership team that meets weekly after school to plan common planning meetings (weekly and monthly) 

*Distributed leadership opportunities in addition to our department heads and grade team leads including IEP 
coordinator, transition coordinator and instructional coach. 

For 2018-2019, we want to continue to build on this strength, but we want to prioritize teacher-led professional 
development. We embrace the belief that teachers should be learning from teachers, and we want to continue our 
gradual release of administrator-led PD. According to the School Survey, 68% of teachers responded as “agree” in the 
innovation and collective responsibility indicator, which is 6% lower than the city average. We believe that if we 
increase teacher ownership of their professional development, we will see an increase in teacher collective 
responsibility for school initiatives. With this collective responsibility will come improvements in teacher practice. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, teacher collaboration and leadership will improve through our continued use of a Teacher Leadership 
program and 80% of all professional development will be planned and led by teachers/paraprofessionals. This 
improvement will be measured by a 6% increase in “Innovation and Collective Responsibility” (within Collaborative 
Teachers) on the School Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

When looking at the School Survey, we have improved this year to be slightly above the city average in terms of 
Effective School Leadership. The results indicate that the Principal makes clear to staff his expectations for meeting 
instructional goals (92 percent), sets high standards for student learning (93 percent), and has a clear vision (90 
percent). We also earned well developed in 1.3, 5.1 and 3.1 during last year’s Quality Review. While these results are 
positive and an improvement from previous years, we know we can always continue to grow. Survey respondents 
indicated that 78 percent felt that the principal knows what's going on in the classroom and only 67 percent feel that 
the principal participates in instructional planning with teams of teachers. Currently, the principal prioritizes 
classroom visits and instructional support to new teachers, probationary teachers up for tenure, and teachers rated 
Developing. Since parts of our morning block are devoted to Resilient Scholars, Transition Planning and Student 
Conferencing (all linked to our priority focus), leadership will also do non-evaluative walkthroughs to support teachers 
during these student-centered, tenacity-focused blocks. 

 

As we build on our strengths and recognize our areas of growth in leadership as it pertains to transparency, reflective 
feedback, and high visibility in instructional supervision will become a top priority.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will be more actively involved in the ongoing development of teachers by attending at 
least one PLC per week and see all the different PLCs at least once a month which will result in a 10% increase in teacher 
satisfaction on the NYC School Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As mentioned earlier, an area of particular focus will be strengthening Family and Community Ties. We saw an 
increase in total parent participate in events from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018. In 2016-2017 we had 171 parent sign-ins 
for school events. This increased dramatically in 2017-2018 where we saw 375 parent sign-ins at school events. We 
celebrate this growth, but we also want to take a critical look at certain events to determine if we can continue to 
grow in this turnout. For example, we saw the same parent turnout at our Family Fair Day in 2018 that we saw in 
2017. Since we are focusing on tenacity, which merges academic, personal and social skills together, we also see the 
need to provide guidance to parents on what this looks like. This will allow students to get certain skills and mindsets 
reinforced at home. We want to continue to focus on bringing families into the building to share their knowledge with 
us. Until our parent engagement reaches 100 percent, we strongly believe there is more work to be done.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, the school will increase parent participation in the educational and social/emotional aspects of each 
student’s High School career by at least 15% as compared to the previous school year, measured by attendance at 
school events.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. 75X754, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

75X754 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
P754X’s 2018-19 Title III program will focus on arts-based language instruction. We aim to 
serve 36 ELLs whose IEPs mandate 12:1:1 instructional ratios. We will host eight instructional 
sessions on Saturdays beginning in February 2019. Sessions will last from 9:00 am-2:00 pm. All 
instructional sessions will be open to parents of ELLs, who are strongly encouraged to attend and 
participate. The program will be staffed by four TESOL and TBE-certified teachers, three 
paraprofessionals and one assistant principal. We will use OTPS funds to hire the services of 
Inside Broadway, an approved DOE contractor, who will assist us in providing arts-based 
language instruction. 
The arts are a valuable tool for educators and students at all levels. The arts, in all forms, enable 
individuals to showcase many aspects of life, and offer deep experiences in reflection, 
communication, experimentation, enquiry, probing, and imagination. Research has proven that 
the skills learned in the arts may aid students in mastering other subjects, such as ELA and Math. 
Evidence has also suggested that integration of the arts in school curricula contributes to student 
achievement. “High school arts teachers often describe the positive effects of arts education as a 
strategy for engaging and motivating their students.” (Critical Links: Learning in the Arts and 
Student Academic and Social Development, 2002).  
We at 754X believe that incorporating the arts and art-making into English language instruction 
will enable English Language Learners to cultivate and expand their proficiency in the 
modalities of reading, writing, speaking and listening. For example, the use of the visual arts in 
the classroom can enhance language development by offering non-verbal practices for 
communication by providing a platform for students to create images connected to words. It is 
our hope that by integrating the arts into our Title III program, our ELL population will practice 
new ENL learning strategies that will augment language acquisition. 
The Title III instructional program will infuse theater arts, dance and visual arts with content 
areas addressed during the school day. The Saturday sessions will be divided into thirds. In the 
first third, held from 9:00- 10:30am, students and their parents will partake in interactive 
ENL/Dance lessons. During the second block, held from 10:30am – 12:00pm, students will be 
instructed in literacy with a focus on oral and written language that is specific to the Theater 
Arts. At 12:00 we will  break for a 30 minute lunch, which P754X will provide. The Third block, 
held from 12:30pm- 2:00pm, will provide mathematics instruction in the context of Visual Arts, 
more specifically, the measurement and numeracy in design. 
Inside Broadway will facilitate the artistic aspects of the program. Their goal as an organization 
is to bring the arts directly into the school community while nurturing a life-long love of theater 
and the arts. Goals include language and vocabulary development, emotional literacy, enhanced 
speaking skills and a better understanding of oneself and others. OTPS funds will be used to pay 
for Inside Broadway, for four iPads on which we will record student performances, and for 
theatrical props used in student performances.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
The program is designed to utilize the disciplines of voice, acting and choreography to engage 
students and parents in new pathways of expression. Using musical theater scripts and songs, 
students and parents will explore the themes and issues of the selected material and will correlate 
the experiences of the characters to their own lives. 
By using scene study techniques, students and parents will explore the texts of the selected 
scripts and songs to better understand story arc, character motivation, expand vocabulary and the 
ways in which prose and lyrics can relay emotions and propel language. Students will also gain 
insight into the elements of dramatic structure while being able to recognize character intentions, 
obstacles, subtext and resolution; all while building language fluency. All work will be 
highlighted and exhibited during the Program’s showcase (to be held on the last day of the Title 
II program). 
Emphasis on the New York State New Language Arts Progressions will be the platform for most 
of the curriculum planning. According to the Chancellor's expectations, students should also 
experience Common Core-aligned instruction across all subject areas.  The NLAP provides us 
with a framework to ensure that students receiving English as a New Language are meeting the 
CCLS.  Units of study for the Saturday program will primarily focus on NLAP Standard 1, in the 
areas of Writing, Reading and Speaking/Listening for grades 9-10. The following Standards will 
also be intergrated during instruction, and are meant to work in conjunction with the 
abovementioned NLAP standard. 

Part C: Professional Development

Begin description here:            
P754X will conduct four professional development sessions which will begin in late January 
2019 prior to the start of our Title III program. Sessions will be ongoing throughout the program. 
PD will take place on four Wednesdays from 2:05-4:05 (students are dismissed at 2:00 on 
Wednesdays). Sessions will be supervised by one assistant principal who will not be remunerated 
from Title III funds, as PD sessions overlap with our AP’s official hours. 
Research has shown that professional development plays a vital role in raising student 
achievement. To paraphrase Jacob and Lefgren, in order for teachers and administrators to be as 
effective as possible, it is necessary that they continually expand their knowledge and skillset to 
better implement successful educational practices (Jacob, B. A. & Lefgren, L. 2002). 
Professional development enables educators to professionally flourish in order to help students 
learn at the highest levels. Ongoing professional development emphasizes team growth through 
collaboration. 
With this in mind, Professional Development (PD) for our Title III Program will explore best 
practices in ENL in the form of a Professional Learning Community (PLC) where all participants 
will contribute by facilitating during each PD session. The administrator, three teachers and four 
paraprofessionals will participate in all Title III Program PDs that will focus on ENL practices 
and visual/theater arts in the classroom.   
Professional development sessions will focus on scaffolding techniques described in the Quality 
Teaching for English Learners (Q-TEL) model.  All participants will present material from 
Classroom Instruction That Works with English Language Learners (Hill and Bjork, 2008), 
during each professional development session.  The sessions will begin with Chapter 1, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52

Introduction to Research and conclude with Chapter 15, Generating and Testing Hypotheses. The 
professional development sessions will focus on this text and development of multidisciplinary 
lesson/unit plans (math, literacy, science)  focusing on nutrition, based on concepts in the 
literature.   

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Research provides us with substantial evidence that parental involvement and engagement is 
associated with high student academic performance and social competence. One relevant study 
compared students whose parents are more highly involved with students whose parents are less 
involved. Rebecca Marcon (1999) looked at 700 urban preschoolers in Washington, D.C. Using 
teacher reports of parent involvement, she compared students’ grades and skill ratings. Children 
with highly involved parent ratings, compared to those with low ratings, scored higher grades. 
This year's Title III program aims to increase parental engagement among our ELL population. 
The Saturday program encourages students and parents to participate in all activities together. 
Parents will be invited to all sessions. Lunch will be provided to encourage participation. It is our 
hope that parents, students and school officials will have the opportunity to collaborate, build 
community and enhance relationships to better suit the academic and social evolvement of our 
students. 
To incorporate Dance, students and parents will work with an Inside Broadway teaching artist on 
a choreographed musical piece from selected Broadway material. Using visual art techniques, 
students and parents will design and recreate theater backdrops and props. Along with each 
design piece, students and parents will provide museum captions describing their complete 
pieces.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 The school uses SCANTRON Performance Series to assess students early literacy skills. SCANTRON  is a computer based 
assessment that utilizes lexile measures to analyze  student levels in Language Arts, Reading and Mathematics. 
SCANTRON  automatically adjusts  student performance levels as they navigate through the various assessments and provide 
detailed evaluation of student literacy skills embedded through the content areas. Assessment data and results show severe 
deficiencies in literacy skills across content areas for our ENL students. SCANTRON  data accounts for more accurate student 
placement,  diagnosis of instructional needs, including instructional adjustments,  and measurement of student gains across 
reporting periods.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of our ELL program is evaluated using a variety of data which includes NYSESLAT, NYS exams, Periodic 
Assessments, and a wide variety of informal assessments, such as portfolios and report card grades.  We use an ELL Inquiry 
team to study longitudinal progress of every student. This data compares not only the NYSESLAT and ELA scores but the 
percent gains in each of the aforementioned assessments. We closely monitor assessment data to determine the academic 
success of our instructional approach to our ELL programs. Assessment data is reviewed officially by school leadership on a 
quarterly basis through paper and online reporting. We also consider the engagement of our ELL families as a factor in the 
success of our ELL programs. It is essential to involve our parents in order to promote students’ success. Our ELL parents are 
engaged in parent workshops during the supplemental program. . The progress that these parents make, in their language 
development and in their ability to engage in their students’ school work, is an element of our ELL program success. 
Additionally, our staff members’ professional progress is a measure of the success of our ELL programs.  
     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Currently, 754x serves ELLs in grades 9-12.    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns indicate that a significant number of students, regardless of grade level, reside in the lower levels of 
performance. 86 total students register in the Entering(Beginning) category. Despite overall success in acquiring course credit 
and passing report card gradesmany of our students do not achieve the same type of success on the examinations.  This does 
not necessarily indicate, however, severe deficiences in English language proficiency.  The significant disabilities of our 
students must also be taken into account. The students at our school display a wide range of impairments that include 
cognitive disabilities, emotional disturbance, and test anxiety. In evaluating the whole child, which these assessments do 
not,  it becomes apparent that student language proficiency is not as poor as it may appear.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction is delivered to ELL's in the following ways:  
ENL teachers collaboratively teach with traditional subject area teachers using various co-teaching models 
Pull-Out services 
Integrated Model 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

 Students are grouped in our standardized assessment program based upon grade level which is determined by credit 
accumulation.  In our Alternate Assessment program, students are ungraded and classes consist of students in similar 
age groups and similar academic levels, where possible. Therefore, students are taught in heterogeneous settings by 
both grade and level.  Most of the time, students are in groups according to whether they are designated 
standardized or alternate assessment.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We only have an alternate assessment TBE program.  HNL is taught by the classroom teacher in conjunction with ENL 
services provided by an ENL teacher.     

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Currently, 754x only features ENL and TBE programs.    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              Instructional minutes, as described on the charts below, are delivered to students by way of the Push-In, Pull-
Out model conducted by the school's ENL teachers. The LPT analyzes student requirements  and communicates  student needs 
to the ENL teachers. ENL teachers  are required to devise their schedule, which receives oversight by the Asst. Principal of the 
LPT, to ensure accuracy and proper instructional time.  Our bilingual teachers are each responsible for teaching 2 of the 4 core 
subject areas . Classes visit different teachers and thus receive instruction in all content areas.  Additional native language 
support is provided through the use of specifically selected school personnel who are fluent in the student's native language. 
  
 Students assigned to our TBE program are serviced by bilingual teachers and ENL teachers.  Students in this program receive 
the number of units of ENL and HLA instruction as delineated by CR Part 154. ENL instruction for all Entering ELLs is 540 
minutes per week ; 360 minutes per week for our Emerging ELLs and 180 minutes per week for our Transitioning and 
Expanding students along with 180 minutes of ELA instruction.  ENL minutes are delivered  by an ENL pedagogue. Additionally, 
TBE students receive 180 minutes of Native Language Arts (HLA) per week by certified bilingual pedagogue.  
  
Our ENL teachers also provide pull-out services to students at our off-sites and at our main-site. Students in our ENL program 
with IEP mandates for ENL only receive ENL services from our certified ENL teacher.  Students’ with IEP recommendations for a 
TBE program that benefit from the ENL program are provided with Alternate Placement Paraprofessionals who speak the 
students’ native language and English.  Students in our ENL program according to the CR Part 154 are entitled to the following: 
for students at the Entering level, 540 minutes per week for ENL instruction, students at the Emerging level receive 360 
minutes of ENL instruction per week and for students at the Transitioning and Expanding levels, 180 minutes of ENL instruction 
and 180 minutes of ELA per week. Commanding students receive 900 minutes of ENL instruction for two additional years.  
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                To ensure that students meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards and pass the required state and 
local assessments, ENL instruction is delivered via content specific curricula. In English Language Arts and Content Areas, 
instruction for ELLs emphasizes on language acquisition through planned linguistic objectives and integrates principles of 
Universal Design for Learning (UDL). We use ongoing assessments to modify language allocation in instruction throughout the 
year, so as to most appropriately scaffold students developing language proficiency as students progress in response to 
instruction. This strategy incorporates the principle of Academic Rigor, as teachers scaffold students to perform at the height 
of the Zone of Proximal Development.  
Teachers, equipped with a current and comprehensive view of their students’ levels of language proficiency within each 
modality, are best able to plan for instruction that both supports and challenges their students, with the most appropriate 
allocation of native and target languages, to meet the demands of the CCLS. We then focus on integrating these cognitive 
approaches throughout the subject areas. This extends language learning, as well as promotes content comprehension. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

Instruction is provided in a classroom environment that supports academic language development. Characteristics of this type 
of encouraging environment include comprehensible input, low affective filter, and error acceptance. In addition, students 
practice language while processing complex and abstract ideas. This scaffolded curriculum is driven by standards-based 
instruction in order to promote high student achievement. ENL teachers collaborate with classroom teachers to ensure 
coherence of content instruction. Instructional plans are shared so that ENL teachers and classroom teachers are planning for 
students to achieve the same lesson objective, with scaffolded approaches tailored to individual students’ needs. We utilize 
multiple ELL-appropriate resources to support our children in content-area learning. 
Instruction is supported with multicultural library books, the use of technology, and the adaptation of literacy materials to 
meet the needs of students with severe disabilities. To comply with New York City’s Literacy requirements, each classroom 
library contains books in the native language, including those adapted by teachers to meet the needs of students with severe 
disabilities. All instructional materials, service supports and resources, and adapted teacher-made materials are age and grade 
appropriate.   
In the school's TBE program, core content is delivered to students via certified teachers who are responsible for 2 core content 
subject areas.  In the school's ENL program, ENL teachers work collaboratibely with traditional subject area teachers to impart 
instruction. Collaboration between all members of the ELL community is essential in determining student needs and creating 
viable student objectives. This collaboration is achieved by way of administrative scheduling and includes analysis of student 
work by members of the school's Assessment Team. All teachers utilize the Danielson Framework for Teaching  in an effort to 
reflect, refine, and successfully deliver instruction. Multi-Sensory instruction is common througout both programs  as well as 
teaching language in context. Additional methods include scaffolding, differentiation of instruction, and the continued 
introduction of content-specific vocabulary. This allows for the successful delivery of the demands of the Common Core 
Standards regardless of what program a student is in.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                 All content area subjects in our TBE programs are delivered in English with the exception of HLA, which is delivered in 
Spanish. HLA instruction is parallel to the literacy instruction imparted in monolingual classes and is provided by bilingual 
teachers utilizing native language literacy materials. The use of bilingual software and multimedia enhances and supports the 
development and assessment of native language skills. Native language supports are used to evaluate the content 
understanding of students who are not yet able to express their knowledge in English. Bilingual teachers assess students’ 
reading proficiency using native language books. Content area knowledge is evaluated using translated content specific 
assessments for new ELL students. Ultimately, language of evaluation is determined based on ELLs’ dominant academic 
language.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIIFE students are well supported through individualized and differentiated instruction from all content area teachers and 
receive small group instruction during AIS periods concentrating on areas of concern. SIFE students are encouraged to attend 
after school programming at the school as well. ENL teachers design appropriate instruction and assessments to maintain 
rigorous instruction. Specifically, teachers utilize DOK and UDL guidelines.  
Newcomers to the ELL program (1 to 3 years of service) receive mandated bilingual and ENL instruction and additional support 
to build communication skills in English and in the student’s native language through AIS, bilingual paraprofessionals and Title 
III.  For ENL students who are in years 3 through 6 of service, we provide continued development and support for continued 
acquisition of skills through a balanced literacy approach, enhanced communication in both Spanish and English, provisions of 
bilingual and ENL instruction at the worksites, and follow-up activities both in the community and at home.   
Our long-term ELLs (in excess of six years) receive services based on their IEP mandates, and in accordance with their 
proficiency levels as indicated on the NYSESLAT. Some of our long-term ELL students also attend our Transitional Sites where 
they gain additional training and job placement from AHRC.  All instruction is designed to promote language acquisition and 
language growth.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

When students score proficient on the NYSESLAT, they are provided with additional support for two years. Students continue 
to benefit from the school's after school programs. Differentiated strategies and extended time are utilized to support 
language needs.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Subject area teacher's collaborate with the ENL teacher to work with students in small groups, twice weekly, to provide native 
language support in the content concepts and vocabulary, as well as targeted exam preparation for students who will take the 
NYS  exams. Cluster teachers collaborate with the ENL teacher to support students in using language-appropriate strategies to 
scaffold content learning for students.  ENL teachers will specifically work on vocabulary and grammar for all aspects of 
academic language.  Comprehension and writing skills are honed and taught by the ENL teacher during ENL instruction.   
As literacy is a fundamental element of language learning, students receive a comprehensive range of support services in 
developing their reading and writing skills. Targeted students work with guided reading specialists one-on-one or in small 
intervention groups; language of instruction is according to student need (English or Spanish, based on dominant language in 
literacy). 
 Students also receive support through our Title III program, which focuses on building comprehension through targeting 
academic vocabulary. 
Instruction is provided by certified Special Education teachers with bilingual extension and by certified ENL teachers.  ENL 
methodologies used include: TPR, CALLA, Language Experience, the Natural Approach, Whole Language, and multi-sensory 
materials. Students designated as having an alternate placement paraprofessional receive additional support in the native 
language and English from a paraprofessional who speaks the students’ native language and English. The use of technology  is 
incorporated into ENL and content area instruction to give students additional support. Multi-sensory and multicultural 
materials are infused throughout all aspects of instruction.  ELL subgroups also benefit from Wilson Reading  during the school 
day and also participate in all after school programs such as CHAMPS, Title III After-School Program, and other sports 
programs. Wilson reading provides decoding, encoding, and sight word fluency, vocabulary, oral expressive language 
development, and comprehension.  
The use of software and multimedia such as Rosetta Stone enhances and supports the development of English Literacy.  Focus 
on language acquisition is extended throughout the curriculum and subject areas through embedded informational text 
reading strategies, multisensory approaches, cooperative learning, the infusion of the arts, and the use of technology. 
Language instruction within content area subjects is crucial for ELLs to succeed in achieving Cognitive Academic Language 
Proficiency (CALP), in targeted language.  In addition to other resources, ENL teachers utilize content-specific material to 
implement effective instruction for reading and writing.  Materials are acquired or created based on consultion between the 
ENL teachers and content area teachers.  All materials reflect DOK levels and are Common Core aligned.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  All students who attend 754 are identified as having special needs.  All students including ELL subgroups (SIFE, newcomers, 
ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years and Long-Term ELLs) have opportunities to participate equally in instructional programs with 
AIS supports and our shop classes. Our school features the following shop classes:  Dance, Plastics, Woodworking, Auto 
Mechanics, Recycle-a-Bike, Cooking and Catering. Our students also participate in other work related programs such as, part-
time and full-time community-based work and school-based internships when they turn 17 ½.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students in our school receive the following targeted interventions in each content area: 
  
- Small student to staff ratio which allows for more interaction with teachers and individually tailored instruction. 
- Specially qualified teachers who receive the latest training in ENL, TBE, and special education services. 
- Differentiation of Instruction which allows information to be presented in ways students can understand including DOK, UDL, 
and Common Core aligned activities and assessments. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

- Teacher cluster meetings where teachers analyze student data to create individualized interventions for each content area 
subject 
  
In addition, our school offers the folloing intervention programs: 
  
- Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy and other related services in order to enhance the development of the whole child 
and alleviate hindrances to learning 
- Counseling to increase the social-emotional development of the student and enhance learning 
- Title III after school program which provides additional support for students, and parents, in language acquisition 
- CHAMPS after school program which provides  additional support for students and promotes  positive interactions as well as 
physical development 
  
All of our intervention programs for ELLs incorporate English and native langauge when possible.   
  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
A new program to incorporate horticulture and botany for bilingual and ENL students  is currently being designed.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Currently, 754X does not plan to discontinue any programs for ELLs.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELL students are afforded equal access to all school programs as is any other student.  Announcements and flyers notifying 
students about any program are given on both English and Spanish.  Additionally, we will have flyers translated to other 
languages as needed.  Teachers and staff also call parents/guardians to notify them of any programs that are available. 
  
Some of our programs include: 
Title III 
CHAMPS 
Basketball 
Volleyball 
Cheeerleading 
Regents Prep 
Clubs 
Gardening  
Full-Time/Part-Time Worksites 
  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
A new, state of the art Library Media Center was  installed. It is a virtual research facility complete with appropriate reference 
material and a computer lab with Internet access.  Our in-house Library Media Specialist plays and integral role in ELA, HLA, 
ENL resource allocation and research skill development for both teachers and students. ELLs are trained to evaluate websites, 
locate current event articles through on-line databases, and prepare evidence-based claims. Materials utilized include TrueFlix, 
BookFlix, BrainPop, Tumble books and National Geographic en español. Content area materials are available in English and 
Spanish via NYPL resources. The school also has the benefit of SmartBoards and numerous computers available for use. 
Classrooms have extensive libraries with both English and Spanish titles.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

TBE students receive 90 minutes of instruction in their native language per week. HLA classes mirror the ELA curriculum. ENL 
students do not receive instruction in the native language, although they are given the opportunity of working with a bilingual 
paraprofessional. Native language materials are available for students and teachers at our Library Media Center. Home 
language support is delivered in each program via the use of teachers, paraprofessionals,technology, and adapted materials. 
Instruction is given based on CR Part 154 guidelines.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 As 754 is a special education high school, the school is ever vigilant in ensuring that material disseminated to students is 
grade-level appropriate. In both our standardized and alternate assessment programs, the general education curriculum is 
utilzed. Modifications and differentiation occur, but the material is the same. Adapted materials  and technology play a large 
rolein providing necessary resources and support.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
A new, state of the art Library Media Center was  installed. It is a virtual research facility complete with appropriate reference 
material and a computer lab with Internet access.  Our in-house Library Media Specialist plays and integral role in ELA, HLA, 
ENL resource allocation and research skill development for both teachers and students. ELLs are trained to evaluate websites, 
locate current event articles through on-line databases, and prepare evidence-based claims. Materials utilized include TrueFlix, 
BookFlix, BrainPop, Tumble books and National Geographic en español. Content area materials are available in English and 
Spanish via NYPL resources. The school also has the benefit of SmartBoards and numerous computers available for use. 
Classrooms have extensive libraries with both English and Spanish titles.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
  Prior to entering the new school year, newly enrolled students have the opportunity to participate in Chapter 683 (Summer 
School Program) where instruction focuses on acculturating students to the school in addition to supporting them with 
language acquisition. Newly enrolled ELLs also have access to the school's Title III program.  Both programs have the benefit of 
bilingual counseling services.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently, 754X does not offer language electives for ELLs.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Currently, 754X only features ENL and TBE programs. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Individual professional development goals for teachers are discussed with the Principal and/or Asst. Principal .This discussion is 
held at the beginning of the school year at the Initial Planning Conference and allows teachers to reflect on their practice and 
establish ownership of their professional development. The Asst. Principal and teachers are able to analyze offerings provided 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

by the Ditsrict 75 Office of English Language Learners and register for training, if appropriate.  ENL personnel then turnkey the 
information to the rest of the ENL department. Workshops are also held at the school during professional development days 
targeting ENL needs.  
In-house professional development is provided by members of the Language Proficiency Team as an ongoing process 
throughout the school year. Focus is geared towards supporting ELLs as they engage in the CCLS.  Some of the topics include 
utilizing UDL principles in curriculum development, integrating ENL methodologies through unit/lesson planning, and looking 
at student work. Teachers, counselors and paraprofessionals are in constant communication both formally and informally to 
discuss student needs and determine overall ELL goals and progress. Common planning preparation periods have been 
established within  school class schedules in order to enable ENL teachers, bilingual teachers and content area teachers to plan 
curriculum and units of study that utilize ENL methodologies with alignment to the CCLS. The school's teachers and 
paraprofessionals serving ELLs are also supported through coaching services provided by the District 75 ENL instructional 
coach.  A portion of our school  is alternate assessment, ungraded , high school students. These students are working on 
transition goals and CDOS  standards to assist them as they transition from high school to the community. The remaining 
portion of students are standardized assessment. These students earn course credit, sit for the appropriate NYS 
examinations,  and proceed toward college and career.  
Jose P. workshops are provided by District 75 OELL, which specifically target instructional support for Special Education ELLs. 
All non-ENL teachers are required to fulfill 10 hours of training. Records of attendees are maintained in-house and are updated 
on periodic ENL compliance documents. Additionally, we encourage and allow all teachers, paraprofessionals, counselors, 
parent coodinator, therapists and secretaries to attend appropriate professional development opportunities offered through 
OELL and other DOE offices.  The Principal/Assistant Principals approve any appropriate training to help our ELL students 
succeed.  
 Trainings offered by the Office of English Language Learners are attended by ELL personnel who turnkey the information to

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The school provides information on the aforementioned items during scheduled IEP meetings and through monthly telephone 
calls to parents. A consistent and open line of communication exists between the school and families. This year, a pilot 
program is being established which will invite parents in to the school to meet with the LPT to discuss the previously 
mentioned items. This meeting will occur two  times per school year and allow the school to present information  and serve as 
an additional opportunity to discuss student progress. Connecting with parents regarding these items is also accomplished via 
the orientation and follow-up sessions conducted for the Title III program. Parents are also invited to become members of the 
School Leadership Team and participate in the Parent-Teacher Association. We provide translation services at all meetings 
where deemed necesarry.  We utilize in-house translators, but will use an outside vendor if a special language is needed that 
we cannot accommodate from in-house staff.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of ELL students have excellent opportunities to become involved . To begin, parents are sought out by our Parent 
Coordinator to become members of the School Leadership Team.  Parents who do not speak English are welcomed and 
interpretation services are provided. This affords parents the opportunity to be an integral part of the decision-making process 
at the school level.  Parents are also invited to attend and participate actively in the school's PTA.  The Leadership Team and 
the PTA offer parents fantastic opportunities to receive information, offfer input and feedback, and understand the direction 
the school is heading.  Outreach is also cionducted by the Parent Coordinator to solicit information from parents  as to ways in 
which the school can offer assistance. The school conducts monthly workshops for parents based upon the information 
gathered.   Title III is another way parents are engaged and involved in the school. This program occurs after school and is 
accompanied by a newsletter and weekly opportunities for parents to come to the school and engage in educational activities 
with their children.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Daniel Hoehn, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used to assess our school's written translation and oral presentation needs consists 
of the following:  

- Home Language Identificaiton Surveys (HLIS)  

- Parent interviews, specifying what language is preferred for all written and oral correspondence  

- Student Registration Form  

- Place of Birth report (RPOB)

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Language  

The majority of the 
translation and 
interpretations need to be 
in Spanish. However, we 
have added Haitian Creole 
and several African dialects 
as needed. Our findings 
were recorded during 
faculty conferences, staff 
memos, and ongoing 
communication between 
the teachers and the 
families.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

In order to fulfill section VII or Chancellor's Regulations A-663, in September no later than 30 days from the school's 
opening, we compile and review HLIS and RPOB data to determine the primary language spoken by the parent of each 
student enrolled in the school. In addition, in our main office we have posted in English and the 8 languages as per the 
chancellor's Regulations, the signs indicating to parents the availability of language services provided by the DOE. The 
data collected is used to determine in which languages school notices have to be translated and interpretation 
services needed. Our bilingual staff members provide the written translations and interpretation services needed to 
the greatest extent possible. When in-house staff members cannot provide the specific services needed, we request 
services from the Department of Educations' Translation and Interpretation Unit. We also distribute written 
notification to all parents, whose primary language is a covered language by the DOE, of their rights regarding 
translation and interpretation services.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In addition to the procedure outlined in Part E, we will monitor all new entrants in the same manner, relying on in-
house support or the Translation and Interpretation Unit. If internal resources are not available, we will enlist an 
outside vendor for translation and interpretation services.
