Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission is “to provide students access to resources and experiences which build the confidence, knowledge, and 
skills necessary to succeed on the path to a high school, college, and career of their choice.” To this effect, we used 
the resources that came with having a larger student population to make programmatic changes and continue 
partnerships intended to provide additional supports to our sub-groups, our at-risk students, and our teachers.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Archer Elementary just completed it’s seventh year as a school in District 12. Our school is comprised of 490 students 
from grades Pre-K through 5th grade in the General Education classroom, Integrated Co Teaching Classroom and Self 
Contained Programs. Since starting as a PreK through 2nd grade school, Archer has added a grade every year, meeting 
capacity in 2014-2015. Since then, Archer has started expanding the programs offered to our students and families by 
opening an ICT classroom every year since 2014-2015 when we started with 5th grade, with a goal to have an ICT on 
every grade in the future. Our school population is 24% Black, 57% Hispanic, 2% White, 14% Asian. Our enrollments 
stands at 53% male students and 47% female students.  

 

Aside from the diverse programming we offer to meet the academic needs of our students while ensuring they 
remain in the Least Restrictive Environment, Archer Elementary also departmentalizes for ELA and Math in Grades 3-
5.  

 

For the the second year in a row, Archer will be partnering with LEAP to provide our students and families with 
opportunities to explore the arts and STEAM through during and after school programs such as Textiles, Cartooning, 
Dance, Tomorrows Entrepreneurs and Drama. In addition, we continue to partner with our CBO Kids Creative/Roads 
To Success to provide a wonderful arts and academic related after-school program, as well as Archer Shakespearians, 
a program that allows our 4th and 5th grade students to perform a theatre performance of a Shakespeare show in 
June. During the 2018-2019 school year, Archer will maintain it’s connection with the local YMCA to offer swimming 
lessons to the 2nd graders and will continue our partnership with the Bronx Zoo.  

 

Other great aspects of Archer include: 

- Our collaboration with mental health agencies including NY Foundling and Visiting Nurse Services, Rose Kennedy 
Center and community agencies, that which many of our students and families are affiliated.  

- Partnered with Josh Groban to produce a 4th/5th Grade rock production of a Shakespeare performance. 

- Staff members who have attended trainings around RULER, a Social Emotional Learning program out of Yale 
University. This program will be used to develop and support teachers, students and the community around Social 
Emotional Learning. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 531 opened as a “new school” in 2011-12 with students in Pre-K through Second Grade. The 2016-2017 school year 
is our third at capacity; our first group of Fifth Grade students graduated in June of 2015. We are currently considered 
a school “In Good Standing” with New York State, and we received 5 "Well-Developed" and 5 "Proficient” ratings 
across all indicators on our most recent Quality Review (May 2018) and PPO (May, 2018). 

In terms of demographics, we are a Title I school, with 90% of our students qualifying for free lunch in the 2014-15 
school year. 22% of our students are English Language Learners (ELLs), the majority of whom speak either Spanish or 
Bengali in the home. 27% of our students have IEPs. PS 531 shares the Joseph O. Loretan Campus with PS 536 and PS 
691, two other elementary schools. Each year, our school takes an incoming Kindergarten 12:1:1 Self-Contained class, 
which often includes students with handicaps which limit with their mobility (we are a barrier-free building). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

These changes were based on assessment data (state and in house), MOTP/MOSL results, survey results, and 
feedback from school reviews (QR, PPR), and as a result, for we have: 

-Moved to a “departmentalized” system for the Third-Fifth Grades. Each grade has an exclusively scheduled 
math/science and an ELA/Social studies teacher 

-Trained three mentors through the District partnership with New Teacher Project who mentored a total of six 1st-3rd 
year teachers during the 2015-16 school year, three teachers during the 2017-2018 school year and will mentor four-
six teachers during 2018-19 school year. 

-Committed to training two teachers in Reading Recovery, an intensive, proven reading intervention program for first 
grade students during the 2016-2017 school year and an additional teacher during the 2018-2019 school year 

-Hired an additional ENL teacher during the 2018-2019 school year to support push-in/pull out instruction based on 
our rising number of ELL students 

-Hired a Guidance Counselor to support administration with teacher coaching around behavior management, running 
Student Intervention Team, working on/implementing school wide character curriculum, behavior support plans, and 
being a point person for OORS/discipline code issues. 

-Worked with a Generation Ready Consultant on effective ENL strategies 

-committed to the use of TC Units of Study for Reading and Writing in grades K-3 to support alignment of skills and 
rigorous instruction with a consistent approach. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

While these initiatives had a number of positive outcomes, the elements of the Framework For Great Schools in which 
we made the most progress were 5b (Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture 
where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers) and 5c (Collaborative Teachers: 
Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity 
to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement). Much of this 
progress was due to the increased size of our out of classroom staff. The addition of a Social Worker and the 
instructional coaches allowed each member of our leadership team refine their responsibilities and focus on a clearly 
defined area of school improvement. The addition of ESL and AIS providers allowed us to service a wider range of at-
risk students. Clear responsibilities resulted in better lines of communication around services, which allowed us to 
provide academic and emotional support services in a timely manner. 

Instructional coaches, the Special Education Coordinator, our Guidance Counselor, and the ESL Coordinator all 
provided teacher support in specific specialty areas. Feedback from these sessions allowed us to better tailor our 
professional development plan to teacher need. The result of these systems was improved teacher practice, as 
evidenced by an increase in MOTP ratings from early to late observations. 

Our key area of focus for the 2018-2019 school year is Element 5a (Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, 
inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are 
actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills). Over the course of the last 
two years, we have worked to increase the volume of student writing during the school day to help students develop 
their own voices as writers. Last year, we focused on creating conferencing systems that allowed students easy access 
to peer and teacher feedback to help guide them during independent work. Based on a review of student data, test 
scores and Quality Review and PPO feedback, as well as changes to our curriculum, Archer staff members will 
continue to reflect, refine and revisit our units of learning in both ELA, Math and other subject areas. We will

collaborate to ensure all students are actively engaged in intellectually stimulating work that challenges them to 
problem solve and apply higher order thinking skills as measured through on going data collection and discussions. 
Additionally, Archer will put a strong emphasis on ensuring that students, staff and families feel as though Archer 
remains and improves upon being a supportive and safe environment for all community members (Element 5b- 
Supportive Environment).

General Overview: 

ELA 

 

At PS 531, we take a number of steps to ensure curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and 
instructional shifts. From the 2011-2012 school year until the 2017-2018 school year, Kindergarten through Second 
Grade based our ELA curriculum on maps developed by commoncore.org and Lucy Caulkins TC Writing Units. Each 
themed unit was planned around a CCLS-aligned culminating task. Starting in May-August of 2016, we started to 
redesign the maps to integrate Caulkins' new TC Reading Units of study.  

On the Third-Fifth Grades, we began using Expeditionary Learning as our base ELA curriculum in 2014-15. We chose to 
use the Expeditionary program because of its heavy use of non-fiction texts, the high level of alignment between the 
texts and the social studies continuum, and the instructional focus on use of text evidence to support answers, all of 
which are elements of the ELA shifts. To further align our instructional practice to the CCLS and the shifts (and based 
on student work and assessment data), our upper grade teachers modified Expeditionary to include explicit writing 
instruction based on grade-level language standards and a Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) block to build student 
stamina. From May-August of 2016, we redesigned the maps and our scope and sequence in grades 3-5 to include 
writing across genres and additional "culturally relevant" material for students who are growing up in New York City 
and implemented the use of our writing conference folders to ensure students were receiving consistent and 
actionable feedback that they could speak to, use when working independently and refer to during their reading and 
writing instructional periods. These shifts resulted in a reduction of students performing at a level 1 from 58.6% in 
2014-2015 on the ELA state exam to 38.2% in 2016-2017 and then to 35.6% in 2017-2018. Our students performing at 
a proficient level in ELA has increased consistetly from 20% in 2015-2016 and 30% in 2017-2018. 

For the 2018-2019 school year, Archer made the shift to TC Units of Study for Reading and Writing in all grades, 
Kindergarten- 5th grade while maintaining all the work that was completed in years prior. This shift came after looking 
closely at our horizontal and vertical alignment of curriculum across grades during the 2017-2018 school year, and 
identifying areas that did not align and/or were misaligned. The shift to TC Units of Learning for both reading and 
writing will provide Archer with a common language around instruction and ensure horizontal as well as vertical 
alignment across our ELA blocks. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

 

Math 

 

At the start of the 2013-2014 school year, we switched math programs from Envision to GoMath based on DOE 
recommendations of program alignment to the CCLS. Early analysis of unit tests (and data from the Third Grade State 
Math Test) showed that students were improving their ability to compute, but were struggling with problem solving. 
This data led us to incorporate Exemplars into our math curriculum during the ’14-’15 school year. Exemplars focuses 
on teaching students how to read and interpret complex word problems based on real-life scenarios, then choose and 
execute a problem solving strategy. The program provides word problems (on 3 levels) based on each strand of the 
CCLS for Mathematics. Exemplars has a pacing calendar aligned to GoMath which allows us to choose word problems 
that require students to apply the concepts they are working on to more complex problems. Consistent use of the 
program across grades has helped students develop deeper understanding of the standards, as evidenced by 
improved communication about the problem-solving process on both unit tests and Exemplars.  

 

In the lower grades, we also noted that students were having trouble moving from 1-1 correspondence to the concept 
of “whole” numbers. When given basic addition and subtraction problems, students were often “counting up” or 
using fingers rather than adding and subtracting whole numbers. During the 2015-2016 school year, we worked with a 
math consultant who taught teachers different strategies to build number sense. As a result of this work, all lower 
grade classrooms now have short (5-15 minute) number sense routines built into their day as either quick math 
activities or during morning meeting. These routines have coincided with an increase in math fluency in our younger 
students. Our percentage of students scoring at a "proficient" level on the Math state test rose from 13.1% to 15.6% 
from 2014-15 to 2018-2018 . 

 

Across subjects 

 

We have engaged in discussion about planning multiple entry points into curricula and activities to meet the needs of 
all of the various groups of students at our school. This will be discussed further in the “pedagogy” section. As a result 
of this professional learning, all lesson plans include ways in which either work products or work process (including 
instructional group size) is differentiated to allow every student to access standards-aligned instruction and academic 
tasks.  

During the 2017-2018 school year, we participated in 6 weeks of Professional Learning around Instructional Planning 
to support teachers in developing lessons that targeted student need, student choice and assessment alignment to 
learning tasks and objectives.  

 

Data and Implications: 

We looked at a number of data sources for this needs assessment, including: Third-Fifth grade test scores and growth 
percentiles, actual student responses from the state tests, Fountas and Pinnell Running Record data from all grades, 
STAR Literacy data, and student writing samples from both ELA and math assignments from across grades. Analysis of 
this data showed a few trends:

Students reading below grade level did not achieve proficiency on the State Test, regardless of their ability as 
writers 

  A significantly diminished number of students scoring at Level 1 on the State ELA and Math assessments from 

 

2014-15 to 2016-2017 
Significant increases in students scoring “proficient” (Level 3 or 4) on the State ELA and State Math exams 
over the past two years 

  English Language Learners were achieving at a level lower than their peers across assessments 
  The quality of student writing (as assessed using a rubric based on Grade-Level Language Standards) dropped 
when students were producing work outside of the traditional “” sphere (lower quality writing from the same 
students on math and science assessments) 

  Every grade has 10-15 general education students who were reading significantly below grade level.Looking at 

data from previous year, these students were our “late readers;” kids who came to school with no early 
literacy skills and took a longer time than their peers to demonstrate emergent reading behaviors.The biggest 
achievement gaps were in the 2nd and 3rd grades, but by 5th Grade the students were close to “catching up” 
(generally reading within a year of grade-level). 

While practices related to all of these areas will considered when creating our professional development plan, based 
on these findings and feedback from our Quality Review and PPO, our main focus for the 2018-19 school year will be 
improving our writing proficiency across all content areas. We will do this by developing questioning and discussion 
practices across content areas to ensure our students are exposed to and demonstrating higher level thinking skills.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will a 20% increase in the number of students achieving proficiency on both the NYS ELA and Math 
exams.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

Our school has generally received positive feedback from parents and teachers on questions relating to school culture 
on the DOE Learning Environment Survey. In 2017-2018, we received a score of 3.80 on the DOE’s Environmental 
Survey in this area. According to the 2017-2018 survey, 95% of families reported that our school offers a wide variety 
of courses, extracurricular activities and services to keep their child interested at school. A list of the programs we 
have put into place to provide a supportive environment includes: 

 

  Relationships and Referrals to outside agencies for Mental Health Services (NY Foundling, , ETC.) 
  Character Education Program push in provided by Guidance Counselor using 2nd Step Curriculum based on 

school wide themes, teacher request for support and/or incident reports. 

  PBIS program that incorporates Class Dojo and opportunities to "purchase" PBIS reward activities and School 

Spirit Apparal at the Archer Store 

  Mediation during student conflicts or misunderstanding 
  At-risk counseling (Groups and Individual sessions) 
 
  Conduct PD on child abuse and neglect with teaching staff yearly and other topics as needed. 
  Present topics and discussion in at risk or mandated sessions that support self-esteem, character, social skills, 

School Liaison for and other Child protective agencies. 

and respect for all. 
Inclusion of Social Worker on School Cabinet 

 
  Conduct suicide assessment during crisis with students 
 

“Buddy” classroom partnerships between upper and lower grade classrooms for Reading and Math. 

A previous major area of concern in our data is in response to the question around students harrassing, bullying or 
intimidating others. According to the 2017-2018 survey, 56% of teachers stated that their students rarely or never 
engage in such behaviors. Likewise, this was an area of focus in our Quality Review feedback as a majority of students 
interviewed stated that they have witnessed or experiences teasing and disrespect. To address this area of concern, 
we are partnered with Yale to adopt the RULER program, trained staff members in Restorative Circles and Emotional 
First Aid, introduced Class Dojo school wide and redesigned our assembly and student recognition activities.  

During the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to utilize both our Social Worker and Guidance Counselor to 
provide family outreach and support in addition to working directly with teachers and students to continue to 
improve classroom environments. During lunch and recess, we have partnered with Asphalt Green to support with 
organized cooperative games and team building activities.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our educators’ understanding of the Common Core Learning Standards and Instructional Shifts vary across grade 
levels primarily because some are new to education, therefore we are constantly engaging in discussions that deepen 
our understanding. However, our educators know the importance of planning their lessons with the common core 
standards and student needs in mind. Furthermore, our curriculum was designed using the common core and 
instructional shifts, which further supports our educators’ understanding. All educators are held accountable for every 
student’s academic progress, which means that our collaborative success is top priority. 

For the 2018-2019 school year, we have three Model Teachers who support instruction along with providing cycles of 
support using the Danielson Framework for teachers in need. Our three Model Teachers lead our school-wide 
professional development around Guided Reading and Small Group Instruction through PLCs, Lunch and Learn 
sessions and Individual Teacher Support. Additionally, at Archer we have 2 Reading Recovery teachers who provide 
support to our lowest 1st grade students in addiiton to AIS support using the Reading Recovery model. These two 
teachers support our first grade team during their common planning to support with instructional strategies and 
suggestions to improve instruction, with a lens on the lowest performing students.  

PS 531 continues to work on building an open door culture of collaboration. Our “Area of Celebration” from our 2017 
Quality Review was 2.2 (Align assessments to curricula, use on-going assessment and grading practices, and analyze 
information on student learning outcomes to adjust instructional decisions at the team and classroom levels). 
Additionally, we received a rating of "Well Developed" around 3.4 (Establish a culture for learning that communicates 
high expectations to staff, students and families, and provide supports to achieve those expectations) Highlights of 
our current practices around this section of the framework include: 

  Grades K-5 designing and/or modifying curriculum together based on data from previous years/units 
  Curriculum planning time given after school and weekly Grade Team Meetings 
  Use of specific coaches to help teachers improve aspects of the their practice 
 

Inquiry Teams during professional development time to create an individualized and collaborative teacher 
development plan/s 

  Mentor teachers to support new teachers 
  Work with the New Teacher Center (NTC) Project to train mentors to work with their peers on improving 

practice 

  Training teachers in Reading Recovery who can provide whole school, small group, and individual workshops 

for teachers on literacy acquisition in children 

  Partnership with Carmel Hill to provide access to Accelerated Reader skills inventories 

 

To continue to develop our teacher teams and collaboration, our area of focus for 2018-2019 is around teacher 
inquiry teams. Our focus will be on our use of data to identify students' problems of practice and the instructional

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

“School Leadership” and “Trust” have been our two most highly-rated areas on the School Environmental Survey 
(both receiving ratings significantly above City-Wide averages). Scores in both areas have risen each year. The 
leadership team focuses on working closely with teachers and receiving input from a range of stakeholders and data 
sources to shape the yearly instructional focus of the school in ways such as: 

* The Principal and leadership team have made a number of shifts in daily programming to support teachers and staff 
members and to encourage collaboration across teams, grades and groups. 

* Trained teachers in Reading Recovery to provide targeted support to 1st Grade at-risk students and provide 
professional development to other staff members 

* Worked with the New Teacher Center to train 3 in-house mentors to provide better coaching to new teachers and 
teachers in need of specialized support 

* Moved to a “departmentalized” system for the Third-Fifth Grades. Each grade has an exclusively scheduled 
math/science and an ELA/social studies teacher 

* Hired an additional ESL teacher to support push-in instruction based on our rising number of ELL student. 

* Addition of 3 Teacher Leaders to support with teacher development and feedback/support.  

 

The biggest area of improvement noted in a review this indicator was lack of “timely” observations. According to 
surveys and discussions with teachers, the feedback provided during debrief sessions was not always timely or 
consistent. A priority for the 2018-2019 year will focus on the observation cycle changing from one that is completed 
in cycles at different times of the year to one that is ongoing and provides staff members with a variety of visits 
(formal, informal, drop it, requested) from various members (peers, coaches and administration). With the support of 
our Teacher Leaders, our goal is to improve how quickly and how often teachers are observed and how comfortable 
they are giving and receiving feedback.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

By 2019, school leaders will provide professional development to build teachers' capacity in designing coherent 
instruction and assessment in instruction, resulting in 10% of teachers moving up one level on the HEDI scale.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

PS 531 has been holding well attended parent events since the school’s inception in 2011-2012. Prior to 2014-15, the 
principal held monthly “Tea and Talks” with parents about what was happening in the school and ways to help their 
children at home. Additionally, the parent coordinator organized a variety of cultural events, concerts, and workshops 
for parents. Parent attendance at Tea and Talks and PC workshops has increased each year since 2011-12. With the 
advent of “Parent engagement” time during the 2014-15 school year, teachers also began hosting monthly events by 
grade on Tuesday afternoons. 

In 2015-16, we met our goal of increasing the percentage of parents/guardians who felt they were invited to visit 
classrooms to observe the instructional program (goal was to reach 86%, 92% responded positively). This year, the 
Environmental Survey question with the lowest positive parent response rate was "I have been asked or have had 
time to volunteer to support the school," to which only 70% of parents had a positive response. For 2018-19, we plan 
on continuing the structures we put in place to get parents into the building to see the instructional program, but our 
goal will be to provide more volunteer opportunities to allow all parents to help the school and continue to improve 
parent/school relationships. Our priority need is to raise parent participation within the school and their 
understanding of our school wide goals, which we will accomplish by providing more opportunities to be a part of the 
instructional aspects of the Archer community throughout the year. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 10% increase in positive responses to the question posed to parents around their 
understanding of their child's performance levels based on data check ins provided during Tuesday Parent Engagement.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
 

PS 531 is a relatively new public school. We post any anticipated vacancies on the New Teacher Finder and Open 
Market Hiring systems in April to ensure we have the opportunity to interview the widest possible range of candidates 
before they are hired by other schools. We hold two open houses per year, which allows us to meet and vet potential 
candidates before the interview stage of our hiring process. The school houses student teachers from both Teachers’ 
College and Bank Street, which gives us the opportunity to see potential high-quality teachers in action with our 
students and decide whether or not they are a good fit for our school. After interviews, all high-scoring candidates are 
invited to teach a demonstration lesson with a class of our students. We look for applicants licensed in areas that 
meet the needs of our student population (ESL and Special Education, in addition to Early Childhood and Common 
Branch). All chosen applicants are considered highly qualified as defined by ESEA PS 531 had a 90% teacher retention 
rate between the 2014-15 and 15-16 school years. We have also received consistent high ratings from teachers on the 
school environmental survey for the past several years. We mention this when recruiting and believe that these 
ratings help us get a high number of responses to our postings on the Open Market Transfer System.  

 

To ensure our staff stays highly qualified, we use part of our Title I 5% set-aside to help teachers pay for classes that 
allow them to be certified in multiple subject areas. We encourage all staff members to become leaders and provide 
pathways for them to do so. In the past few years, we have had two staff members in an administrative program at 
Bank Street, another in the LEAP program, and seven participating in the DOE Teacher Leadership Program. 
Encouraging leadership development has helped create a positive culture that is attractive to both current staff 
members and highly qualified teachers looking for a school in which they will have leadership opportunities. 

 
This year, we are also participating in the New Teacher Mentoring Project. Each new teacher is provided with a 
mentor (who spends the year receiving professional development on effective coaching) with whom the new teacher 
meets for at least an hour each week to discuss instruction. This program benefits both the new teachers in terms of 
likely retention and the two coaches in terms of receiving training which will make them more effective leaders within 
the school

2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
 

Our instructional focus, based on our students’ results on State and internal assessments, is “improving our students 
criticial thinking and problem solving skills across content areas.”  

Our professional development plan is geared around helping teachers achieve that goal. The plan includes a number 
of components, outlined below: 

 

Teacher-Led Professional Development – Once every 1-2 months, two or three groups of teachers will create a 
professional development session for their peers. Initial PD topics and the teachers leading those PDs will be chosen 
by administration (and related to data-based instructional needs), but as the year progresses, teachers will be able to 
create proposals for workshops they would like to lead. Staff members will be able to choose the workshop (from the 
menu of 2-3 options) they think best meets their development needs. 

Problem of Practice Conversations – Last year we began specific, targeted discussions around Problems of Practice 
that were being identified through Advance data or teacher identified. PoP conversations revolve around a specific 
instructional or management issue a teacher is having in his/her classroom. The teacher presents the issue (to either a 
partner or group of 3), along with data or student work that illustrate the problem. Colleagues then ask clarifying 
questions, including “Have you tried…” stems. At the end of a conversation, a teacher should have 2-3 self or peer 
generated next steps to attempt in their classroom. 

Admin Run Professional Development – There will be times when we need to discuss a specific instructional issue 
based on internal data as the year progresses. Administration will run PD on those days. 

In addition to Mondays, we have other professional development and learning structures in place: 

After School Single PD Sessions: These sessions are optional and teacher-led. The sessions are primarily for newer 
teachers, but anyone is invited. To date, we have run single PD sessions on: administering running records, 
administering ECLAS, elements of guided reading, creating goals for small groups, and smartboard basics. Additional 
planned sessions include: smartboard intermediate and advanced, creating SMART IEP goals, individual Danielson 
component sessions, and ENL strategies. The purpose of these sessions is to support teachers who are either new or 
might need additional help in a specific area. The topics of the sessions come from a combination of input from 
teacher leaders and administration. 

Grade Team Meetings: Weekly grade team meetings are used for a variety of purposes (instructional planning, 
administrative support, data discussions), but are considered professional learning at least once a month when 
teachers look at student work in a specific area and discuss processes and practices around how that work was 
produced, then get feedback and discuss best practices with grade team colleagues. 

Tuesday “Other Professional Duties” Time: Twice a month, content area teams will meet from 3:20-4:00 during 
“Other Professional Duty” time. Teams include: Special Education, ESL, Math, ELA, Lower Grades, and Social-
Emotional Support. During this time, team leaders will facilitate content-specific discussions focusing on planning, 
best practices, and data in relation to practice in their area.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

Book Clubs: One time per month, 45 minutes of Monday PD time was devoted to book clubs around texts that 
teachers selected to read (from a provided list) . The teachers will read the text throughout the school year and 
prepare a share for the staff in June around the text and the implication it had on professional practice.  

 

 
Part 3: TA Schools Only 

3a. Use of Program Resources 

Describe how the TA program resources will assist participating children to meet proficiency. 
. 

 

 
3b. TA Coordination with the Regular Program 

Describe the planning, coordination and support of the TA program with the regular educational program (i.e., 
providing ELT, accelerated, high-quality curriculum, including applied learning; and minimize removing children from 
the regular classroom during regular school day). 
. 

 

 
 
 
 
 
Part 4: SWP Schools Only 

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
-Multiple Open-School Events - one before K admissions and two for students and parents once they are registered 
for Kindergarten to allow the families to see classrooms and learn about expectations for Kindergarten Students. 

-Individual parent discussions about concerns and/or services students received before Kindergarten to ensure a 
continuity of services. 

-K parents workshops in September and November to allow parents to see their child's classroom and get a better 
understanding of routines and expectations. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teacher decision-making about assessments takes place on multiple levels. Teachers have input into several types 
assessment measures, including: 

-The specific Measure of Student Learning they will use on each grade. Teachers receive professional development on 
the different beginning/end of year options available to measure student progress (running records, online 
assessments, and performance assessments), then choose the option they think will be most appropriate to measure 
the progress their students have made from the start to the end of the year 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

-The school has a set of periodic assessments (and an assessment calendar with due dates) developed by teachers and 
administration of the course of several years. Teachers use Accelerated Reader, F+P Running Records, and the ECLAS 
Phonics suite to assess reading progress four times over the course of the year and Accelerated Math to assess math 
progress. Teachers have been provided with workshops on the administration and scoring of all above assessments 

-All lessons (documented through lesson plans) include a "formative" means of assessing student understanding of 
the daily learning target to provide teachers with the data necessary to make real time instructional decisions. 
Teachers have received professional development around different types of formative assessment and are able to 
select the specific type of assessment they believe will give them the most accurate data around student 
understanding based on the material taught 

 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 531, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 531 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act. 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS 531 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 
1. 

 

2. 

3. 

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 
academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 
the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  
1. 

Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 
workshops and conferences.  

Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 
community needs.   
1. 

These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
Archer Elementary currently serves about 120 ENL students from grades K-5. We have about 50 
Emerging and Entering students and 30 Transitional students.   During the 2017-18 school year, 
we had more than 20 New Comers register at Archer, all of whom had proficiency levels of 
Emerging and Entering.  Additionally, more than half of our ENL students are not on their grade 
reading level and are struggling with writing. As a result, we will provide additional small group 
instruction for our English Language Learners in order to support their second language 
acquisition. Our group instruction will have a particular focus on academic language across all 
subjects.  We will be instructing in English as we have a diverse array of language backgrounds 
(Spanish, Bengali, Arabic, etc).    There will be a total of 6 teachers (4 ENL certified, 2 common 
branch) providing additional support to our ENL students. We will use WriteSteps and Targeted 
Phonics to supplement our ELA curriculum while focusing on the academic language in GoMath 
to support language acquisition across content areas.  These programs should support language 
acquisition via engagement with high-interest, standards-based writing, language, and math 
content.  Classes will be formed by heterogeneously within NYSELAT Grade Bands (1/2, 3/4, 5) 
to allow students to receive support from both teachers and peers at a range of levels of English 
acquisition. 
Program Logistics: 
Before school: 7:15am-8:15am Day : Tuesday - 30 sessions.  Each of 3 groups will be taught by 
a certified ENL teacher 
After school: 2:45pm-4:45pm Day: Wednesday - 30 sessions.  There will be 3 teachers (1 ENL, 
1 ELA, 1 Math).  Teachers will rotate for 45 minutes with each group, so each student recieves 
ENL, ELA, and Math instruction. 
Duration: October 2018-April 2019 
Timekeeping/Attendance: Teachers will take attendance at each session, which will be collected 
and archived by the ENL Coordinator 
Assessment: Teachers will use initial school-wide assessment data (F+P Reading Level, 
ECLAS Phonics, BOY Math Testing Results).  Teachers will collect 
Note - the total cost of the program as recommended will be $16,376, including an overage of 
$1,322.  The school will supplement the cost of the Title III LEP using other funding sources.

Part C: Professional Development  
Begin description here:            
Archer Elementary English Language Learners are currently placed in Freestanding ENL classes 
and in General/Special Education Classrooms. It's been identified that teachers are struggling 
with strategies and support needed to reach all level of learners, especially in terms of ensuring 
students acquire Academic Language and Skills needed to increase their reading levels to 
understand grade level content. 
Additional Professional Development will be provided to teachers (both ENL and CB) to support 
making curricular and instructional modifications to meet the needs of ENL students at a range 
of proficiency levels.  Development will be offered during school via Grade Team 
Meetings, through optional "Lunch and Learn" sessions, teacher meetings  and after-school per-
session opportunities.   A member of the ENL staff will attend District ENL learning 
opportunities and PD and use this information as a basis to turn-key to staff. 
 
After School PD: Beginning end of September 2018, then sessions will be once every 6 weeks 
until May 2019.

Title III Teachers will provide ongoing workshops to promote Family Engagement. Workshops 
will include topics around the importance of practicing what is taught in school through 
homework and how parents can reinforce what students are doing during class. Teachers leading 
these parent-workshops will send home monthly calendars to inform parents of upcoming 
workshops as well as bilingual or native language resources they can utilize in their homes. We 
will provide translation for Spanish speaking parents through letters sent home, which will be 
translated by in-house staff members. We will also provide Bengali and Spanish translation 
during the parental engagement time, provided by our in house staff who are fluent in the 
language. Other languages not provided by in house staff will be translated using electronic 
software during the workshop for the parents who need it and parents who volunteer.

 The workshops will be held once a month on Tuesdays during the 45 minute parental 
engagement time. Additionally, we will also offer 2 hours of training on Saturdays from 9-
12:30pm, while students are engaged in other programs. This program will run from October to 
April, when the other programs run, totaling approximately 10-15 sessions. The money will be 
allocated for per-session time. We will have 2 ENL Certified teachers and 1 General Ed. leading 
the workshop on Saturdays. Title III Teachers will provide training to the parents who need more 
support. 
Topics include:

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Archer Elementary uses three methods to assess student proficiency in literacy. The first assessment tool is  ECLAS, which 
measures a student’s command of phonics as well as their degree of phonemic awareness. In  addition, students are assessed 
through running records to ascertain their Fountas and Pinnell reading level.  The last is STARS, which measures the standards 
of reading, literature, foundational and information. The results of these assessments allow the school to tailor reading 
materials to a student’s level as well as choose specific reading and decoding strategies to teach each student. The data shows 
areas that  
the children need to improve to meet reading grade level expectations. Such as letter sound awareness, names of letter, 
beginning and ending sounds, decoding and syllabication. This data helps inform our school about areas that each individual 
child needs to improve in order to move forward as a reader.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

We currently group students by reading levels in grades K-2 and provide targeted instruction based on their reading levels. 
Students rotate and receive guided and independent instruction to move forward as readers. Students who are below grade 
level receive Reading Recovery, individual targeted instruction. In grades 3-5 we provide students with guided instruction with-
in the classrooms and also with the ENL providers to meet students individual reading needs. Teachers assess students to 
ensure students are making progress and to provide them with skills and strategies needed to advance to the next level. 
Students in grades K-5 who do not make progress during the guided and classroom instruction are grouped into AIS and 
receive additional focused instruction to develop basic skills needed to make progress. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Archer Elementary believes that data and test scores for each student is a way to evaluate if a program is successful. We also 
believe that professional development, teacher training and solid instruction all help to determine or drive the “data”. 
Therefore, since this is the first year we are received ELA and Math State Scores, we are currently developing an accountability 
plan to put in place for all teachers to begin to implement good teaching strategies aimed at reaching the English language 
learners in their classroom. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the data has been gathered a team of teachers (Special Education Coordinator, Instructional Coach, Content Teacher, 
and ENL Teacher) meet to discuss classroom strategies and skills taught and student's past  and current interventions received. 
Students are then added to an AIS group or a Reading Recovery Group where the reading specialist works with the students to 
acquire reading support for 6 weeks and monitor student progress. Where as the ENL teacher provides students with language 
support needed to make connections to the reading support being offered. We then meet again to discuss if the students 
progress and next steps. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our RTI team collects data from teachers who are concerned with students who are not making progress. We then discuss if it 
is an instructional challenge or the student needs more scaffolding support in the classroom. We observe the classroom 
teacher and write our findings of classroom support, differentiation, strategies and skills being taught. We then meet with the 
teacher to discuss interventions needed in the classroom, after 6 weeks if the student does not make progress, we then 
provide AIS to the student and evaluate if they have met their targeted intervention plan. If the still is still struggling we then 
meet with all teachers again to discuss the next cycle of interventions and request data to compare other students on grade 
level.  Teachers provide F &P data, writing pieces, ECLAS or phonics assessments, track the STAR assessments. Depending on 
the specific reason for the referral we compare how the student is making progress in other areas. If the student is not making 
progress and it is not an instructional problem, we meet with the teacher to request a meeting with the parent to discuss 
other options available for intervention.      
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We noticed that the majority of our ENL students fall within the intermediate and expanding levels.  Students who have been 
in ELLs since 2  nd   grade who have not moved are SWD. Those students are mostly EM and TR, have have been on that level 
since the first language assessment.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

This year we provided teachers with trainings before and after school and discuss how to make adjustments based on the data 
received from assessments. Teachers who have attended the workshops have made adjustments to their lesson planning 
incorporating various models and strategies of teaching ENL students. We focused on specifically training ENL and Content 
teachers on the SIOP Model. Making sure teachers build students backgrounds prior to teaching concepts, since our struggling 
students are between the Entering and Transitional Proficiency levels.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school provides free standing and both push-in and pull-out classes to serve the needs of ELLs.  
The ELLs are grouped by proficiency level and serviced throughout the day, with various certified ENL teachers. The 
classes are heterogeneous. Students in grades K-5 are in one class with one teacher most of the day. We have 2 
Freestanding ENL classes that are serviced by certified teachers. Integrated Model: Those teachers receive additional 
support from the ENL Coordinator 1 or 2 a week, to support the EN and EM students. The other classes with ENL 
students: K- pull-out, 1  st  -pull-out, 2  nd   (Both) 3 and 4  th   both, 5  th   Pull-out and Push-in. Servicing is given as it 
is mandated on the CR part 154.2 as well as what is needed for the student at the time of instruction.  
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Teachers will be pushing-into classrooms during the ELA or Math portion of the day and pull-out students during the ENL 
time of the day. The push-in, pull-out servicing will be grouped by students based on level of proficiency and classroom 
instruction. EN, EM, TR students are grouped together, TR, EX, and CM are also grouped together based on the instructional 
and language need of the students as stated on their assessments and classroom instruction. As students make progress the 
teacher groups students accordingly to address their language and academic needs.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Teachers will plan language objectives that target mastering of content. After assessing students, they will develop lessons 
using scaffolding strategies: visuals, language structure, building background knowledge and target specific language needs 
during both instructional approaches. During the push-in model, teachers will co-teach with classroom room, in a small group 
and or add additional support throughout ELA instructional lessons with differentiated activities. Students are able to read in 
their native language are given glossaries. The ENL teacher also uses real-ia in the students native language to build their 
background. Teachers also incorporate, to their ELA Lessons: background knowledge, contextual vocabulary, close reading, 
guiding and, comprehension Questions, Structured Organization around writing (Graphic Organizers, models, prompts, 
sentence starters). Using the EngageNY Scaffolding suggestions guide and our new writing program WrtieSteps.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Students that speak Spanish are given the Spanish LAB to determine their language proficiency.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

All students receive support that enables them to meet lesson objectives according to the way they are able to learn. 
Newcomers  receive visual support and a vocabulary review, sentence starters and more to understand content in the 
classroom. New comers are also grouped from grades 3-5 to receive basic phonics and language support. 
•     English instruction as a support structure to clarify, build prior knowledge, extend comprehension, bridge experiences. SIFE 
and Developing students also receive scaffolding support prior to learning instruction and during instruction, visuals, 
manipulatives, vocabulary review, videos and more. Former Ells are given structures and process needed to complete 
assignments as well as other scaffolding supports as needed throughout instruction. We also use these scaffolding for all of 
our ENL students: meta-cognitive development: self assessment, think aloud, asking clarifying questions, using a rubric for self 
evaluation. Contextualization: metaphors, real-ia, pictures, audio and video clips, newspapers, magazines. 
 Building Schema: bridging prior knowledge and experience to new concepts and ideas.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL-SWDs are served according to the specifications in their IEPs, and are taught by a certified special education teacher. The 
ENL Specialist pushes in to special education classes as well as pulls-out to provide language support. Teachers of ELL-SWD use 
visuals, real-ia, media and many other materials such as math tools, flash cards, RAZ-KIDS, Imagine Learning,  and 
Fundations  to support students and provide access to academic and content areas. Students are provided with flashcards, 
manipulatives and other tools necessary in each subject.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school ensures that all students are able to reach academic success, within their IEP goals. Teachers provide support to 
students by scaffolding the curriculum; providing linguistic sentence structures, using videos, and adding pictures to words as a 
way to reach students visually. They also provide students with graphic organizers to assist in the organization of the text, and 
pre-teach any vocabulary to connect to background or build background knowledge.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The ENL teacher provides students with intervention based on the data taken from classroom instruction, NYSELAT, STARS and 
F & P. Students are grouped homogeneously and heterogeneously throughout the day. The ENL teacher provides students 
with phonics intervention based on the data taken from the Stars, NYSELAT and F & P. Students are grouped homogeneously 
and heterogeneously throughout the day. Students in grades K-5 who are emerging and transitional who have acquired 
language acquisition but are not making progress in reading are given additional support by our reading recovery specialist or 
AIS support teacher. 
Students in kindergarten through second grade at the intermediate and advanced level of language proficiency are grouped by 
reading levels and are given instruction to meet their language goals build their English language. For math we target 
content/language objectives after and before students are assessed in order to build their vocabulary and acquire foundational 
math skills.  ENL teachers push-in to support expanding students during math and pull-out entering students who need to 
building basic math skills. We use Exemplars to teach students steps to problem solving. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We will begin a intervention cycle similar to AIS, where target student's comprehension needs based on the STARS and the 
F&P. After assessing students, teachers will work on specific reading skills and post test to make sure students have mastered 
the skill.    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our Ells rotate throughout the school, with groups that are within their levels and interest. Every Friday we have Enrichment, 
where they chose a club and participate in small groups such as,  Math through Art, Chess, Board Game Mania, and many 
others with assist with the second language acquisition. We are currently in the process of also developing a after school 
success academy for our ELLs.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The Go Math program, which focuses on interactive and visual learning, is used to enhance students ‘mathematical skills. It 
also provides Spanish materials for students. Hands-on lessons are used to teach students science. These areas are integrated 
with literacy whenever possible; math stories and science experiences often become fodder for language experience writes. 
Students experience whole-class instruction, shared and guided reading and writing, and reader’s and writer’s workshops, in 
addition to completing individual work. Both fiction and non-fiction literature and topics are treated. Before, during, and after-
reading activities and strategies help prepare students for work, actively engage them, and solidify and process their 
understanding. Fundations, a comprehensive phonics program, coupled with the computer program Imagine Learning, is also 
used to assist students in literacy. They also use Accelerated Reading to  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In K we have a Bengali Para who provides translation to students. We also have a bilingual para who provides bilingual 
translations to students as needed. We have school aides and other staff who assist in translating for students in their home 
language as needed. We also use SAY Hi App and Google translate for minimal words and phrases for our students.     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The Special Education coordinator ensures students are receiving the required services as mandated on their IEP. She meets 
with all the service providers in the beginning of the year and schedules their services and gives me a copy.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The Go Math program, which focuses on interactive and visual learning, is used to enhance students ‘mathematical skills. It 
also provides Spanish materials for students. Hands-on lessons are used to teach students science. These areas are integrated 
with literacy whenever possible; math stories and science experiences often become fodder for language experience writes. 
Students experience whole-class instruction, shared and guided reading and writing, and reader’s and writer’s workshops, in

understanding. Fundations, a comprehensive phonics program, coupled with the computer program Imagine Learning, is also 
used to assist students in literacy. They also use Accelerated Reading to  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We schedule a parent orientation for K parents and discuss the various programs available and options for their 
student. Together with the School counselor and parent coordinator we schedule workshops to assist parents with emotional 
and mental support for their students. We also plan academic workshops together with the Instructional math and reading 
coaches, with the outside Exemplar Provider and ENL Specialist for parents and ensure translation is available for parents of 
other language that attend. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have a DL program.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Teachers are given PD in the beginning of the year in using the NYSESLAT to drive instruction. They are also guided throughout 
the year in how to teach, scaffold and differentiate instruction for our students. We also meet once a month to discuss student 
progress and targeted intervention needed to meet student goals. We also have a NYCWP that all staff members attend on 
writing. The Secretary attends training outside of the school.  
Teachers are offered various PD that enables them to meet students where they are achieve second language acquisition. 
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ENL sends an email with upcoming PD topics to all the staff in the school, then sends out an sign-up sheet with content 
area- grade and area of concern. She then plans her PD based on teachers feedback and based on the data and past years 
reports. She plans the PDs before and after school to accommodate teachers schedule. The sign-up sheets, agendas and 
attendance sheets are kept in a binder in the office labeled ENL with handouts and topics given. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
In the beginning of the year the PC schedules on going meetings with parents once a month during Tea and Talk with the 
principal, where various topics are discussed. During the sessions they also discuss goals of the school, various school options 
and language development.  
The Archer Elementary School website lists school events of note for parents, and also features a “Parents’ Corner” where 
parents may find more detailed information regarding the content of their child’s education at Archer Elementary school. 
Closer to spring, Ms. Kelly, the ESL Specialist, will host parent workshops on ways parents can assist their child with the State 
Exams. 
Translation services are available to all the parents. Parents are invited to school concerts, publishing parties, and science fairs. 
All parents are encouraged to share in these celebrations. 
The school will provide workshops on a variety of topics: standardized testing, reading research and balanced literacy, and 
open house (where parents meet with classroom teachers and get information on all aspects of the curriculum. Parents are 
also invited to celebrations of academic work (i.e. writing celebrations, family reading night) held at various times of the day to 
maximize parent participation. Parent workshops are facilitated by Administration and the Parent Coordinator, and are 
presented in English and Spanish for our large Spanish speaking population. One aim of the ELA workshops will be to provide a 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

 

context for understanding reading progress. Parents will also be provided with strategies for helping their children pick “Just 
Right Books”. Familiarizing parents with school policy for homework communicates the school’s high expectations for each 
student and how that is related to homework.  
SLT meetings are also held once a month in the evenings for the parents to attend. In addition, our parent coordinator is 
always available to speak to the parents. There is an active parent association that meets monthly. In addition, workshops are 
given to engage parents in the process of exploring and articulating their own reading habits. Presenters share multiple 
strategies and ideas to help parents support children’s reading. During these meeting, parent leaders address needs of parents 
and discuss ways Archer Elementary can provide workshops to address their needs.  During parent teacher conferences 
parents also discuss needs they may have with the teachers. We also review parental involvement surveys to determine needs 
of parents and ways to address them.  
Tuesday's during the Parental involvement activities address the needs of parents by trying to reach and assist them with their 
social, academic and emotional needs through internal and external resources.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Since our school has a large population of ESL students and students with HLOE, even though they are not classified as ESL 
students, parents are still invited to participate in all of our workshops. We ensure translators are provided and parents 
understand the content being given.  During the parental involvement time on Tuesdays teachers provide various workshops 
that address parents needs and concerns of their students. Each grade has a focus and throughout the year they elaborate on 
the topic based on parents surveys and students progress. The ESL Coordinator provides translation to Spanish parents, and 
we have parent volunteers who translate in other languages as needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Zakariah Haviland, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At registration, all parents are administered the Home Language Identification Survey. The parent may select to 
complete the form in either English or the native language. An ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator are present to 
explain purpose of the HLIS to the parent. If necessary, school staff, that are fluent in the parent's native language 
are available to assist in interpretation, or the DOE Over-the-Phone Interpretation Service may be utilized.  

In Section 3 of the HLIS, the parent indicates the language(s) that s/he would like to communicate both orally and 
in writing with school staff. This year the ENL Coordinator will use data obtained from Section 3 of the HLIS in 
order to pre-assess which language(s) will be needed for the current school year. The ENL Coordinator will then 
begin to update the record of parent language preferences, which is maintained and continually updated by the 
ENL coordinator throughout the school year. Primary language information obtained from ATS and the emergency 
card is shared with the administration, Parent Coordinator, School Leadership Team, and Pupil Accounting 
secretary. Classroom teachers of students whose parents have selected to communicate in another language are 
notified. The ENL Coordinator will be responsible for providing translated school notices and forms, as well as 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

arranging for any interpretation services that may be required with the office of translations for face-to-face 
meetings such as Parent Teacher Conferences and IEP meetings. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language

We meet with the teachers in the beginning of the year to discuss regulations and distribute copies of the regulations.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

A copy of the notice informing parents about their rights regarding translation and interpretation services in covered 
languages and instructions on how to obtain such services is sent to all non-English and non-Spanish speaking parents 
who are now in the school during open house and during the parent orientation. A sign in each of the covered 
languages is posted in the Main Office and posted in the entryway of the school. 

Parents will also be informed that their child may need a translator in their home language for the standardized 
exams. Translators are then provided. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We receive feedback from parents during workshops, and parent surveys, SLT meeting and PTA meetings. We then 
determine how we can improve our language services. We've added translations for homework using EngageNY, 
notices sent home and ensuring parents are receiving support in their native language every time they come in for a 
visit.
