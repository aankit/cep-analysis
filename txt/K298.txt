Section 2: Executive Summary and Organizing Principles 

 
The Objective 
The intent of this Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) is to continue to frame a three-year process 
for each Renewal school and design a comprehensive plan that outlines a strategic path to a paradigm shift in each 
school at every level. The motivation driving this work is our commitment to providing every child with a school that 
meets their academic and social-emotional needs. Closely accompanying this imperative is our belief that every school 
can be renewed and foster a community based culture of learning. The job of the district is to use our position to 
provide the systemic vision, strategies, and resources to facilitate school renewal through a collaborative effort including 
all stakeholders.  
 
The core values held as essential for the success of the School Renewal Program: 

  A “learning stance” must be held by all community members (district leaders, school leaders, school staff, 

community-based partners, students and families). The work should be approached with humility and integrity. 
We must all be willing learners. 

  A “theory of action” must guide the work to ensure clarity and coherence. 
  Authentic teams that collaborate in the spirit of trust, within and across the various levels of the school 

community, are prerequisites for successful school renewal 

  Schools will be places of robust engagement, anchored in positive youth development, ensuring that the school 

environment is welcoming and empowering for students, families and community members. 

  Strong professional development/learning is a fundamental part of our work. 
  The school renewal implementation must be simultaneously dynamic and responsive as well as sustained over 

the three year period of renewal. 

 
The organizing Theory of Action that guides the School Renewal Program strategy: 

By using the Six Elements of the Framework for Great schools as our improvement structure, we seek to align 
instructional coaching and leadership development with structural supports in order to build staff capacity.  
Using schools  instructional foci, school leaders  and staff will implement changes  in curriculum,  instruction, 
school  culture  and  structures  so  that  there  are  sustainable  improvements  in  student  outcomes  and  school 
culture. 

 
The arc of the School Renewal Program strategy: 
In order to attain high levels of achievement for all students in Renewal  schools we must build capacity to increase 
student achievement through the adoption of new attitudes and behaviors, research based strategies that improve 
teacher practice, coupled with the use of clear data driven supports for building students’ skills in the content areas and 
increasing student engagement. We are particularly prioritizing reading and writing across the curricula.  The use of 
student learning data will drive instruction through strong teacher teams; onsite, job embedded professional learning 
and problem solving, and accountability at all levels of the system:  central, district and school - for results. Renewal 
schools are provided with intensive training, leadership and pedagogical coaching, and structural supports, monitoring 
of implementation and ongoing feedback and revisions as needed. Further, each Renewal school will become a 
Community School and strategically partner with community based organizations (CBO) to integrate social services and 
expanded learning time into the fabric of the school to help them better serve the needs of students.  These schools will 
stand as centers of opportunities where families can get the supports they need to make sure students come to school 
ready and able to learn. 
 
School Receivership   
In April 2015, state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo created section 211-f of the State Education Law, which 
established the School Receivership program as a new intervention strategy to turn around struggling schools. This new 
law, and Commissioner’s regulation 100.19, requires that “Persistently Struggling Schools,” defined as Priority Schools 
that have been in the most severe accountability status since the 2006-07 school year, be given an initial one or two-
year period under a “Superintendent Receiver”.  These schools were placed in receivership under the New York City 
Schools Chancellor. Each school must make demonstrable improvement on specific benchmarks or it will be placed 
under an independent receiver. Under the Chancellor’s Receivership Plan, the School Renewal Program is NYCDOE’s 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          5 

 
core strategy for turning around struggling schools. Renewal Schools have already begun implementing significant 
interventions and are receiving additional resources and support to accelerate student performance and help close 
achievement gaps reflected in this RSCEP. 
 
Structure of the Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) 

The Renewal School Comprehensive Educational Plan (RSCEP) will serve as the organizing and overarching document for 
each Renewal school and will be directly aligned and developed around the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, and Strong Schools, 
Strong Communities, including the following: 

  Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks: Demonstrable improvement benchmarks located in the 2018-19 

RSCEP, in the Data and Accountability Snapshot page.  Receivership benchmarks have been closely aligned with 
the Renewal benchmarks so that schools will have one coherent set of improvement benchmarks to meet.  All 
Receivership Benchmarks are a subset of Renewal Benchmarks. While the targets for these overlapping 
benchmarks are not always identical, the Receivership Benchmark targets are always equal to or lower that the 
Renewal Benchmarks targets. That means that any school that meets its Renewal Benchmarks targets have by 
definition also met its Receivership Benchmarks targets. For additional information on Receivership 
demonstrable improvement benchmarks go here.  

  Establishing an overarching summative vision aligned with elements of the Framework for Great Schools and 

documenting key areas of celebration and renewal through analysis of assessments and by envisioning what the 
desired outcome for each school will be at the end of the School Renewal process.  

  Setting interim assessment benchmarks that create the path for improvement by focusing on desired outcomes 

and goals. In this way, the plan will be mapped to the overarching summative vision. In addition to the five 
discrete goals formed around the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, each school will create an 
action plan. 

  Transformation into a community school in order to increase student and family access to physical and mental 

health services and other social-emotional supports made available in or near the school. 

  Expanded learning opportunities for all students, including additional instruction provided during afterschool 

 

and/or summer programming provided in collaboration with community partners. 
Intensive professional development for all staff to ensure effective implementation of curriculum and 
instruction aligned to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and to support staff in effectively responding 
to the differentiated academic and social-emotional needs of all students. 
  Additional, focused strategies to increase parent and family engagement. 

 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students.

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          6 

 
The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and RSCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive 
Educational Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for 
continuous improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing 
review and analysis of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement 
activities and strategies that improve outcomes for students. 
 

 
Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 
 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          7 

 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

1.  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
2.  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
3.  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
4.  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
5.  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
6.  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
I.  Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
  
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the RSCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the RSCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here.

Next Steps for RSCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists in every Renewal school 

and meets all the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the American Institute of Research (AIR) needs 

assessment, the school’s updated NYSED accountability status and most current quantitative and qualitative 
data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Create a summative vision for the elements of the Framework for Great Schools. 

  Step 5: Revisit your school’s current goals, and strategically create new goals informed by the needs 

assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART – Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you monitor 
progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you have identified, and will let your school 
community know when you have reached your goal.   

  Step 6: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section. Title I schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement 

Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Complete the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) and the Community School sections. 

  Step 9: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether strategies and activities outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust practices along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

In a brief narrative, describe the current state of the Renewal school addressing the following:  

1.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including your school’s mission statement and a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or 
special initiatives being implemented.  

2.  What are the school’s beliefs about student learning? 
3. 
4.  Describe your school’s approach to family engagement and progress made with establishing families as 

Identify any special student populations that the school has and what their specific needs are. 

partners in furthering student achievement  

5.  Describe how your school is leveraging community school partnerships to support progress in elements of the 

Framework for Great Schools and indicate where this has been a challenge. 

6.  Summarize the Expanded Learning Time (ELT) opportunities that have been offered to your students this year. 

The Dr. Betty Shabazz School is committed to providing a quality interactive educational program for all children 
including ELL, special education and gifted students. Our school serves 263 students, of which 73% is African 
American, 24% is Hispanic, and 2% is Asian. 6% of our students are English Language Learners and 30% of our 
students are students with special needs.  

As we strive for excellence, our highly trained staff, in collaboration with the parental community, provides 
challenging experiences to meet the high performance standards that our school fosters. We actively seek to broaden 
our perceptions and understanding of a changing world in an effort to interact with and become active members in a 
diverse society.  

Our school recognizes that teaching and learning must serve as a springboard to improve student performance. With 
this in mind we have a developed a professional development process which helps our teaching body enhance their 
teaching practices through inter-visitations, instructional conversations, and modeling activities that promotes self-
directed learning for students. Our professional development approach also advocates the use of differentiated 
resources geared to motivate the learner. Furthermore our school is powered by values based system known as 
Citizenship, Pride and Respect (C.P.R.). These values are the cornerstones that help to develop character in our 
students as we strive to grow students to become masterful problem solvers and decision makers. C.P.R. reminds us 
that our role as educators is to model these values for our students by how we act and speak to each other and with 
them. With this in mind, our school has established the following goal towards meeting this vision/mission statement; 

1. Improve the quality of teaching as measured by the Danielson Framework for Teaching. 

a. Domain 3B- Questioning and Discussion 

b. Domain 1E- Designing Coherent Instruction 

c. Domain 3C- Engaging Students in Learning 

2. Develop a sound early literacy program by including the following core elements; 

a. Strengthen teachers’ capacity to teach reading 

b. Develop teacher knowledge in the areas of Phonics, Phonemic Awareness, and Vocabulary Instruction 

c. Develop a school wide system to monitor student progress and refine student instruction accordingly 

3. Develop a school culture in which the school staff are; 

a. culturally competent and adept at communicating with families

          13 

 

b. Create opportunities to hear student voices, as appropriate to grade level.  

c. establish a culture for learning that motivates students  

d. will help students develop the skill of using evidence to support arguments in discussion, which will then transfer to 
stronger writing in literacy and math, and develop the communication and collaboration skills that support college 
and career readiness. 

As a part of our Renewal School Benchmark Menu, we selected Rigorous Instruction and Strong Family/Community 
Ties as our leading indicators. We see these two elements from the Framework for Great Schools as an opportunity to 
strengthen the culture of our school community and continue to strive to provide our students with multiple 
opportunities to engage in meaningful and purposeful tasks. Historically, we have low parent engagement. We didn’t 
have a common language around what we expect our parents to do in our school community. As a result, we hired a 
consultant to help us reshape our working definition, and used our SLT as a forum to develop ideas that would 
welcome parents into our community and support their child’s progress in and out of the classroom.  

Rigorous Instruction is the foundation of our work at Dr. Betty Shabazz. We have tailored our instructional focus so 
that, if teachers implement and model instructional and discussion strategies from the Teacher’s College Reading and 
Writing Project, then students will support their arguments using evidence, in discussion, so that they develop 
stronger math, writing, and literacy skills. It’s important to focus our efforts on providing students with the most 
appropriate education to prepare them for college and various careers.  

 

We have to be purposeful and strategic in our thinking and planning around Expanded Learning Time. We would like 
to use the extra hour to provide remediation, enrichment, and mentorship activities that will allow students to work 
on skills and strategies that respond to their specific learning needs. Teachers can also use this opportunity to monitor 
student progress in reading by creating literature circles and hosting book clubs. In addition, student writing will be 
featured through school newsletters, and featured in articles and book reviews written in class. We have provided 
opportunities for teachers to plan rigorous instruction for our ELT which includes summative and formative 
assessments, checks for understanding, questioning and discussion, student voice/autonomy and independent 
thinking varying groups and ability levels.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Summative Vision, Annual Goals, and Action Plans  

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, 
and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious 
intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. (Aligned to DTSDE Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support) 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Part 1a.  Alignment to DTSDE Statements of Practice 
Tenet 3 Statement of Practice  
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
3.2 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of 
rigorous and coherent curricula appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of students. 
Teachers develop and ensure that unit and lesson plans used include data-driven instruction 
(DDI) protocols that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and NYS content standards and 
address student achievement needs. 
The school leader and teachers have developed a comprehensive plan for teachers to partner 
within and across all grades and subjects to create interdisciplinary curricula targeting the 
arts, technology, and other enrichment opportunities. 
Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative 
assessments for strategic short and long-range curriculum planning that involves student 
reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 

1.  Summarize your school’s strengths relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 

2.  Summarize your school’s needs relative to this element of the Framework for Great Schools and the SOPs 

selected above. 
Identify the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this section. 

3. 
4.  What data trends and sources were analyzed, e.g. NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, 

Central-led Review, Quality Review and/or Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) Review? 

This school year, with the use iReady, we have seen growth in our student’s writing and math abilities. Our most recent 
data from iReady, demonstrated that the number of students performing on 2 grade levels below has decreased, thus 
increasing the number of students that made progress in approaching grade level.  

In our most recent Quality Review, it was surfaced that while our teachers are have pedagogical practices that are 
aligned to our curriculum, there are still inconsistencies with providing multiple entry points into the curricula, which 
lead to uneven engagement in challenging tasks and higher-order thinking skills in student work products, including the 
work of ELLs and SWDs. In addition, across classrooms teachers inconsistently used assessments, rubrics, and grading 
policies to check for understanding and provide self assessments opportunities for students' learning. The assessment 
practices limit teachers' ability to effectively make adjustments to meet students' needs resulting in students' receiving 
limited feedback regarding their achievement.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Rigorous Instruction 

What is your school’s instructional focus? What is your vision for promoting the instructional focus consistently across 
classrooms?   
Our instructional focus will be on student autonomy and the impact of student independence through the use of the 
UDL (Universal Design of Learning), with the use of the Teachers College Reading and Writing Program is aligned to the 
CCLS through a balanced literacy, workshop approach. Students are taught reading skills and process writing using a 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          17 

 

mini lesson, active engagement, independent work time, and share out. Individual conferences allow teachers to 
differentiate learning for all their students.  

We will also add Teacher's College Units of Study in Phonics for grades K-1 in conjunction with Fundations, a phonics 
program by Wilson, in grades K-2. Fundations provide children of varying learning abilities with a foundation for reading 
and spelling. It provides teachers with the skills and tools needed to present a structured, sequential, and cumulative 
phonics/spelling program using multisensory teaching techniques. 

GoMath is fully aligned to the CCLS. Lessons are designed to fully facilitate conceptual development, as students work 
from introduction to mastery of each content standard listed in the Common Core. Throughout the lessons, students 
will use manipulatives, models, quick pictures, and symbols as they apply Mathematical Practices to build 
understanding. Students are expected to actively engage in reasoning during instruction, so they are prepared to 
transition from concept or skills comprehension to solving problems in contextual situations. 

The shifts will be addressed by: 

● Reading a wide variety of informational and fiction texts as aligned to the Writing Units of Study as mentor texts and 
through group Guided Reading lessons  

● Using evidence from sources across all grade levels during Writing Workshop units and through book discussions  

● Having rich book discussions through guided reading and read alouds where students give opinions and claims proved 
through evidence in the text 

● Using complex text from TCRWP, Independent Reading library books, as well as the leveled text of Guided Reading  

● Provide for 1 st grade, Reading Rescue, as an intervention  

● Introducing and analyzing academic vocabulary using Ready materials and Guided Reading texts 

In Mathematics we addressed the shifts by: 

● Assessing students’ conceptual knowledge and adjusting instructional practices  

● Revising and adapting curriculum to best meet the needs of the students  

● Teaching to mastery of grade level concepts  

● Targeting mathematical practices; specifically modeling and critiquing the work of others so students explain their 
mathematical thinking  

ELA instructional strategies will include: 

● Strategically align various genres text to units  

● Model use and acquisition of academic vocabulary  

● Use Close Reading to encourage rich, text-based instruction 

In Mathematics, we will develop instructional strategies that: 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          18 

 

● Encourage deep understanding  

● Allow children to make sense of problems and persevere in solving them  

● Help students construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others, use appropriate tools strategically 

● Use problem solving skills to solve math problems  

The following methodologies will support expanded learning time: Double periods, block scheduling, After school 
programs, and a Saturday academy. 

Over 50% of all eligible students will enroll in the After School Program and Saturday Academy. Teachers will use 
Focused Reading Intervention & Focused Mathematics Intervention resources from the Ready curriculum for Saturday 
Academy and Common Core Performance Coach by Triumph Learning for Wednesday & Thursday After School 
Academy. 

The assessments will be congruent to the TC Reading & Writing curriculum. TC Running Records of reading and on-
demand writing will be used throughout grades K-5. In Mathematics, we will continue to use pre and post assessments 
to determine student’s prior knowledge.  

We will conduct four mini state assessments (Book 2) and mock ELA/Math tests twice a year, in order to prepare 
students for the actual exam. Teachers and administrators use the data from the mock exams to make instructional 
decisions around grouping, curricula changes, and inform our professional learning sessions.  

We will integrate a data Consultant, Nigel Collins, of School Data Corp, to aggregate and disaggregate data. Teachers 
will be grouped in inquiry teams to look at student work and running records data in order to make curricula revisions. 
They will also look at the assessments given and determine if any revisions need to be made to them. These teams will 
meet once a week to discuss various students’ progress. Teachers engage in protocols in order to remain focused on 
outcomes. Teachers will engage in collaborative conversations and increase their level of autonomy by completing a 
form to capture their notes, next steps, and rationale for decision making.  

By the end of year 3, we expect that 70% of students will show measurable growth in ELA & Math as evidenced in their 
state exams.  

 

 

What is your vision for the implementation of CCLS-aligned curricula that meets the needs of your diverse learners, 
personally, academically, and culturally?  
Teachers are planned with CCLS lessons that incorporates differentiations and multiple entry points.  

 

 

What is your vision for diverse program offerings that allow students to develop skills, habits, and behaviors to be 
career and college ready? How are instructional shifts embedded in this vision? 
Providing students opportunity to self regulate their learning and opportunities to engage with secondary students and 
career oriented individuals on a monthly basis. 

 

 

What do you envision the delivery of instruction to look like so that all students are set up for success?  
Teachers will be facilitators of student learning and students will be engaged on a task that will include different work 
products.

Key Initiatives: 
Concisely indicate the 
key initiatives (up to 
five) that your school 
will implement to 
achieve the identified 
goal for this Framework 
for Great Schools 
element. 

This year we will 
implement the TC Unit 
of Phonics Study in 
grades K-1 and 
continued with 
Fundations for students 
in grade 2. In providing 
this specific framework 
for our teachers in the 
primary grades, it will 
allow for them to build 
and sustain common 
pedagogical practices 
for our students. This 
will also allow the 
targeted focus on 
building phonemic 
awareness in 
preparation for 
emerging/early readers. 
Teachers will meet 
weekly to discuss the 
progress of the 
program, plan 
supplemental activities, 
and make any 
adjustments necessary 
to the program. Findings 
from our iReady data 
revealed our insufficient 
focus on 
informational/literary 
texts with phonemic 
awareness, phonics, and 
vocabulary building in all 
grades.

Project. Teachers in 
grades K-5 will receive 
extensive training 
through TC staff 
developers, New 
Visions, as well as model 
teachers in our school to 
support the consistent 
pedagogical practices. 
Our TC staff developers 
will continue to provide 
on-site professional 
learning and modeling 
for our teachers, with a 
targeted focus on 
guided reading.  

New Visions will provide 
analysis on Ready, 
iReady, attendance, and 
past data to be shared 
with all stakeholders. 
During teacher team 
time, teachers will 
engage in inquiry work 
with the use of 
protocols to give each 
other feedback on their 
student work products, 
design of tasks, and 
lesson plan activities. 

During weekly teacher 
team meetings, teachers 
will norm their 
assessment practices in 
order to ensure the 
most consistent delivery 
of the assessment and 
scoring. By using 
running records, 
GoMath unit 
assessments, and on-
demand writing 
prompts as learning 
benchmarks, we will be 
able to determine our 
progress in meeting this 
goal. With the support 
of TC staff developers,

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Findings from our iReady display our insufficient focus on informational/literary texts with phonemic awareness, 
phonics, and vocabulary building in all grades. During our parent outreach time (Learning Partners), we will invite 
parents into the classrooms to learn and adapt strategies taught in the classroom that can be done at home. These 
strategies will be provided in English, as well as their home language. In conjunction, parent engagement conferences 
during our parent engagement Mondays with teachers.  
 

 
Part 5 – Budget and Resource Alignment

We have developed a behavior value system that has improved the climate and culture and supportive environment of 
PS 298. This is evidence by the OORS reporting, which has decreased, as well as the AIR assessment report, which 
surfaced staff feeling that they are part of a safe learning environment. P.S. 298 has been actively immersed in changing 
the behavioral culture of the school since 2011-2012 school year. In the 2013-2013 school year, the school began the 
holistic implementation of the Citizenship, Pride, and Respect Behavior Management System (C.P.R.) within the school 
environment. The C.P.R. Program is a program aimed at influencing and changing the way students see themselves and 
their school, and how they interact with one another. Our objective is to forward the vision of creating a school where 
the theme of C.P.R. is richly evident and enforced school-wide, having P.S.298 serve as a model school for others to 
emulate in the future. 

-Staff involvement: The entire staff is responsible for forwarding the implementation of the program and seeing to it 
that their individual students are bought into the program. While there is a clear template as to when to give students 
stamps, the teachers are the decision makers in terms of when they will reward their students with a visit to the C.P.R. 
store. It shows students that earning the stamps and being able to use them are all connected to how well they carry 
out the mission and goals of C.P.R. Teachers are able to speak with me during prep times as well as during the times I 
visit classrooms, or anytime in between to discuss how C.P.R. is or isn’t working in their respective classrooms.  
-Student involvement: Students are the center of this program and are integrally involved in the process. Besides the 
obvious task of making sure they are following the C.P.R. Rubric, students are becoming more actively involved in what 
it means to show C.P.R. in the building. Students begin their morning with the Pledge of Allegiance and with sharing a 
C.P.R. moment they are proud of for the week. We now also have students who have made it their jobs to help out in 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          26 

 

the cafeteria to ensure that bathrooms are monitored and that students pick up after themselves. Students will also 
have C.P.R. clubs, where they will choose one club to be a part of over a cycled rotation. Students are able to practice 
C.P.R. and showcase what they have learned in their clubs. 
-Parent involvement: This year, there has been a continued focus, headed by Ms. Batts, the Parent Coordinator, on 
working on ways to bring parents back into the building and reconnect them to the community. One of the main issues 
discussed over last few years is the fact that many parents have felt unwelcomed, unheard, and disrespected over time, 
and this has led to a lowered level of participation with the school overall. Parent workshops continue to be in place to 
give parents a reason to come in. Everything from Nutrition to Empowerment, to Morning Tea with the Principal have 
been implemented to have parents join in and make themselves part of the community again. As a result of great 
programs being implemented, parent involvement has increased by about 5%. 

 

Based on our SESIS reports, related service providers observations, and School Based Support Team (SBST) observations, 
there is a need to provide more support for at risk students. Students are not receiving the amount of time with 
guidance counselors and appropriate academic interventions.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Supportive Environment 

What is your vision for a supportive school environment? How will you in partnership with each CBO and families 
enact your vision? 
Our school is a place where students, faculty, staff and parents work together to provide students with experiences and 
education that will make them masterful decision makers and problem solvers. In addition, we will use our knowledge 
to work with other people to make a better world where children will be future leaders. Our school uses a Behavior 
Value system, which includes the following components: Citizenship- Students work cooperatively in the class, are 
engaged in shared decision making, peer mediation, and conflict resolution. Pride- Students demonstrate sense of worth 
for the school culture and environment, and participate in school sponsored activities. Respect- Respect is 
demonstrated through their use of language, behavior, and how they treat other. All students are given passports and 
receive a Citizenship, Pride, Respect (CPR) stamp indicating they have met the goals noted above. The impact is seen in 
the small number of OORs. If students receive a sufficient number of CPR stamps they can purchase items from the CPR 
store. CPR rewards include lunch with the principal, visiting the game room, trips, and special prizes. This system has 
improved attendance, increased participation in classrooms, created a reduction in suspension, as well as a reduction in 
behavioral challenges. This program targets ELL, gifted, general and special education students and has been successful 
with all populations. 

Our school CBO is Partnership with Children. We will be utilizing this program throughout the 2018– 2019 school year. 
Their mission is to strengthen the emotional, social, and cognitive skills of at-risk children so that they can succeed in 
school, in society, and in their lives. 

Students are provided an opportunity to have voice through the Student Government. They meet weekly to discuss 
school concerns. Students are provided time daily to state the morning pledge and their CPR moment with the school. 
Children are selected as student of the month and they write what they did to become the student of the month. They 
have bi-monthly C.P.R assemblies where there are acknowledged for positive behaviors. 

Our school has adopted the CPR program as our PBIS program. Its’ objective is to curtail the serious behavior challenges 
the school had been facing in the past, and continue the creation of a visible and dynamic school culture that promotes 
positive values for students. We will continue to, not only, build up the moral of the school based community, but also 
the connections we have with our parents and the community at large. 

The CBO’s program will help promote our students social, emotional skills during school hours and in an afterschool 
program. This will be done through civil engagement, interactions in the classrooms, young men and women groups, 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          27 

 

peer mediation, newspaper, school store, leadership, and job & career readiness. The CBO will also support our 
counselor’s efforts with additional social workers to help support our at-risk students. 

We will continue to implement our CPR program and measure its success through surveys of students and teachers. In 
addition we will work collaborate with Partnership with Children to determine an increase in student attendance rate, 
improve classroom behavior, parent engagement, increase student self-awareness, and improve student self 
management skills.  

In order to respond to student social and emotional needs teachers will model effective classroom management and 
build their capacity to deal with crisis in their classroom. School leadership will deal with crisis, improve the school 
environment, make strategic decisions, and foster a positive school environment. Finally, we will engage the entire 
community, bringing together students, parents and guardians, teachers, administration, and FSC to discuss the data 
that is reflective of the social and emotional well-being, creating a circle of support of each student.  

Our attendance rate will increase by celebrating our students on their perfect attendance, hosting CPR assemblies, and 
providing biweekly parent newsletters that promote good attendance. Our parent coordinator will assist with increasing 
parental engagement through workshops and wake up calls. The family worker will make calls and home visits to 
parents which will enhance student attendance. We have school messenger to contact parents regarding their 
attendance.

Part 3 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools – Supportive Environment. Your goal must be consistent with the 
expectations in part 2, responsive to the identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART – 
Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Meeting your SMART goal should directly impact 
meeting at least one of your Renewal Benchmarks and/or Demonstrable Improvement Benchmarks. 
By June 2019 the school will increase its academic press toward academic achievement for all students including SPED 
and ELLs, as measured by a 5 percentage point increase in parents and teachers who respond positively (agree or 
strongly agree) on the New York City School Survey to questions in the social-emotional learning section.

4.3  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core Learning Standards 

(CCLS)-based instruction that leads to multiple points of access for all students. 

4.4  Teachers and students work together to implement a program/plan to create a learning 

environment that is responsive to students’ varied experiences and tailored to the strengths 
and needs of all students.

We have established concrete meeting times for teachers to hold important conversations about looking at student 
work and making collaborative decisions about appropriate curriculum materials. Our teachers have expressed their 
content with working collaboratively, as explained in our AIR assessment. 

Our latest quality review, as well as teacher observations, indicates that across classrooms, our assessment practices 
inconsistently reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding and student self-assessment so teachers 
inconsistently make effective adjustments in the moment to address student learning. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Collaborative Teachers 

What is your vision for collaborative teaching?   

We value teacher collaboration at PS 298. In order to provide teachers with appropriate, uninterrupted time to meet, 
they have common prep times, in which they discuss student work, best practices, and next steps for unit/lesson 
adjustments. Our teachers also serve in inquiry team meetings. Going through the process of dissecting a student’s work 
product and then devising the appropriate next steps is crucial in advancing student learning. We conduct professional 
development in grade bands in order to discuss specific pedagogical strategies and curriculum topics. To continue to 
build on our collaborative culture, we set up and revise our intervisitation practices. We create a schedule based on  

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          33 

 

Teaching and learning in our school is grounded on increasing student engagement. Teachers and students utilized 
technology to provide hands on interactive learning. Teachers receive professional development to deliver instruction 
with rigor. Teacher teams focus on ensuring there is alignment between daily lesson plans, CCLS, and unit plans.  

Teachers provide opportunities for students to deepen their learning through collaboratively planning lessons and units. 
For our higher achieving students, our teachers plan for extensions of activities They plan intervisitations to not only 
share best practices, but also to continue to solidify their collaborative culture in and out of the classroom.  

With the implementation of our value system, CPR, students feel safe and are acknowledged for their accomplishments. 
Everyday, a child is celebrated for living up to our school’s value system.  

In teacher teams, teachers review data regularly to ensure they plan for individual students’ needs. They focus on pre 
and post assessment data, as well as their Running Records data. This allows for them to discuss collaboratively about 
the decisions they make around their groupings as well as the materials they’d like to use to support student learning. 
While teachers look at summative data in their meetings, they also focus on looking in depth at student work in teams. 
In this work, they discuss and implement various scaffolding strategies that will benefits all students, specifically ELLs 
and SWDs.  

With the integration of our community based organization, they will play an important role in the education process. 
They will work closely with teachers, students, and families to improve our attendance, social-emotional needs, and 
strategies to sustain our practice.  

 

 
 

How do you envision collaboration amongst your School Instructional Cabinet to improve teacher practices and 
student learning? 
During our weekly instructional cabinet team, we discuss teacher practices that have been observed and review our 
professional learning cycles. We determine what the greatest need is for the school and also decide on the types of 
differentiated learning opportunities we will provide teachers. We will also discuss particular students that we have 
identified in order to track their progress. We also envision intervisitation and sharing of best practices during 
instruction. teachers will also be encouraged to turn key visited professional developments. 

 

 

How do you envision collaboration within teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
With the support of our Direct of School Renewal, we will continue to implement Data Wise, a school wide 
improvement process. Through this process, teacher teams will strengthen their communication and collaboration 
through norm-setting and the use of structured protocols to engage in conversation about their practice and student 
work.  

 

 

How do you envision collaboration across teacher teams to improve teacher practices and student learning?  
With the support of our Direct of School Renewal, we will implement Data Wise, a school wide improvement process 
across all grades. This will provide us with a common framework and language of engaging in inquiry work. Teacher 
teams will present to each other the work they are focusing on provide each other with feedback to strengthen their 
inquiry work.  

 
What data will teachers and the School Instructional Cabinet regularly review to ensure that they are reflecting upon 
their teaching practices and meeting individual student learning needs?  What is the intent for reviewing each piece of 
data? (ex. Teachers will regularly review student IEPs when developing lessons in order to ensure that tasks are 
appropriately scaffolded.)

Tenet 2 Statement of Practice 
Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
2.2  The school leader ensures that the school community shares the Specific, Measurable, 

Ambitious, Results-oriented, and Timely (SMART) goals/mission and long-term vision inclusive 
of core values that address the priorities outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (RSCEP). 
Leaders make strategic decisions to organize programmatic, human, and fiscal capital 
resources. 

2.3 

2.4  The school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district's Annual 

Professional Performance Review (APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observation and 
track progress of teacher practices based on student data and feedback. 

2.5  Leaders effectively use evidence-based systems and structures to examine and improve critical 
individual and school-wide practices as defined in the RSCEP (student achievement, curriculum 
and teacher practices; leadership development; community/family engagement; and student 
social and emotional developmental health).

In receiving our preliminary cut scores for the 2017-2018 Math exam, we have 76% of students in grades 3-5, meeting 
grade level criteria. For ELA, we have 79% of students meeting grade level criteria.  

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Effective School Leadership 

What is your vision for effective school leadership at your school? 

I will articulate a shared vision and mission with the entire community by having a collaborative approach and 
identifying key stakeholder to build their capacity. Through professional development opportunities, I will be able to set 
a framework of expectations that focus on putting student interests first. In collaborating with our CBO, we will have a 
system of checks and balances, where we set baselines for expectations, periodic and on-going temperature checks that 
reference the Framework for Great Schools. CBO partners are provided opportunities to work in tandem with our school 
community, as a thinking partner, for academic planning, along with creating incentive programs that are rigorous and 
engaging and value-based.

Flexible scheduling; meeting students’ needs by teachers becoming experts in their students reading level. Teachers will 
teach according to a specific reading level band. Non-negotiable time for reading, writing, and math blocks. Science and 
social studies are embedded into the blocks. Use money to purchase books for classroom libraries, support technology 
implementation with MyOn, iReady, and materials that support the foundational skills of reading, for example, Wilson 
and Fundations. 

Using the Danielson Framework, along with my instructional focus, the administrative cabinet will conduct co-
observations to measure teacher practice and impact on student outcomes. The administrative team will have an 
observation and feedback calendar that captures not only when observations and feedback conservations will occur 
place, it will also demonstrate the previous feedback given to teachers. This will allow for the team to make strategic 
decisions for professional learning based on patterns and trends in the data.  

In providing teachers with specific, actionable, and time-bound next steps, we will foster an environment of shared 
accountability. This will allow for teachers to develop their own action plans to improve student outcomes. Committees 
will be established with key stakeholders, CBOs, parents, teachers, to discuss students and attendance that will establish 
norms and expectations to have school-wide strategies that support student growth.  

The Assistant Principal will be integral in supporting the growth of our school community. She will take part in the 
continued implementation of our school wide behavior value initiative, Citizenship, Pride, and Respect, CPR. She will 
also spearhead the professional learning for TCRWP for our school community. Her role will entail conducting 
observations and following up with teacher’s next steps. The Community School Director will focus on strengthening our 
capabilities with the social emotional health of our students. He/she will also focus on sustaining the afterschool 
program and expanded learning time, by providing a variety of opportunities in STEM, robotics, performing and visual 
arts, etc.

Continuing this school year, we have created a comprehensive approach to reach our parents and inform them about 
the events and learning in their child’s class. Every teacher, along with the parent coordinator, and principal, send 
parents a newsletter every 2 weeks. There are also opportunities to bring parents into the school by our Family as 
Learning Partners events and Coffee with the Principal, so that parents can have their voices heard and share ideas and 
concerns with school leadership. 

Our most recent NYC School Survey results indicated that we need to have a more inclusive communication plan for our 
parents, specifically when communicating their students’ goals and next steps. 

 

 
Part 2 – Summative Vision for Strong Family and Community Ties 

What is your vision for having strong family and community ties at your school? 

Upon entering our school, families are greeted at the security desk and there are various examples of student voice on 
the student government wall and student of the month wall. There is also a reading nook where parents can read to 
their child or students can read to each other. Once a month, there is a Family as Learning Partners, where parents 
share in the learning of their students. They go into the classrooms and take part in the instruction. We have Breakfast 
with the Principal, Town-Hall Meetings. We share information with families by our parent coordinator spearheading the 
Parent Newsletter, which outlines the important dates for events taking place in the school. School Safety Officers take 
part in the professional learning opportunities with the rest of pedagogical staff in order to feel part of the school 
community and decision making process. With our monthly safety meetings, safety officers are provided an opportunity 
          46 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

 

to discuss ways to promote safety throughout the building by reviewing various procedures and build collaboration 
amongst all stakeholders.  

We use School Messenger, School Newsletter, which are distributed by each teacher twice a week, and Newsletter by 
the Parent Coordinator. We use our monthly PTA meetings to discuss pertinent issues and innovative ways to increase 
parent involvement.  

Families will become active participants through our monthly town-hall meetings, TCRWP workshops, and end of unit of 
study celebrations. At the beginning of the year, families are invited to Curriculum Night. On Mondays, during our family 
engagement time, families are encouraged to attend the school to visit the teacher and classroom and take part in a 
survey about their child’s learning style and habits.  

Families are part of the process in selecting the most appropriate CBO for our school community. Families, along with 
school and CBO, will develop ways to create various intervention and enrichment opportunities for students. Families 
have a dedicated space where they can conduct research, work with their child, or hold meetings. After conducting a 
parent needs survey, we can determine the various types of adult education offerings for our families. We can anticipate 
that our parents will be interested in more literacy classes, English Language Learning, healthy eating, and maintaining a 
healthy lifestyle. 

Our data consultant Nigel Collins, from School Data Corp, will engage families in making sense of their child’s 
data/progress report. Making the data easy to understand will allow for our families to clearly see where their child is 
making progress and where he/she may need more support. It will also help with determining the types of workshops 
parents might be interested in knowing more about so that they can help their child at home.  

 

 

Within the Community School model, how will families be welcomed into the school and made a part of the school 
community?  What support will administrators, teachers, school staff and school safety officers be given to help create 
a welcoming environment?   Will there be a dedicated space for families in the school? 
 
Every third Thursday the Principal will conduct an open forum breakfast. Each month the school will host FAMILIES AS 
LEARNING PARTNERS inviting families to share in the learning of the child's class. In additions families are invited for 
every 'end of the unit' TCRWP celebrations. we will conduct Town Hall style meetings and the families will have two 
dedicated rooms/space.  

 

 

 How will the school identify and develop families to take leadership roles in school decision making/school 
governance structures? 
 
this will be provided through leadership roles in the SLT and PTA

Section 6: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) Program Description  

 

Directions: Expanded Learning Time (ELT) activities are directly aligned to the elements of the Framework for Great 
Schools, Rigorous Instruction, Supportive Environments, and Strong Family and Community Ties. ELT provides enriching 
educational experiences that happen outside of the traditional school day and blend skill acquisition, relationship-
building and fun to foster academic and social-emotional growth. Summer learning, afterschool programming, and 
extended-day ELT models, when well-implemented, play a critical role in supporting students in all grades and ensuring 
that they graduate from high school, college and career ready. SED requires that Priority schools offer a minimum of 200 
additional student contact hours as Expanded Learning Time in addition to the current mandated length of 900 hours of 
instruction per year (25 hours per week) in grades K-6 and 990 hours of instruction per year (27.5 hours per week) in 
grades 7-12. Effective ELT models will blend school staff with community partners, and will provide a balanced 
curriculum that can include ELA, math, STEM, arts, physical activity, and leadership development. Complete the sections 
on this page to demonstrate how the school will meet these requirements.  
 
Part 1 – ELT Program Goal(s) 

Describe the summative goal(s) of the ELT program for the 2018-19 school year. Goals for ELT should align to the 
Renewal Benchmarks.  How will the school will ensure that all students’ individual needs are served during the 
Renewal ELT and how the school’s vision for ELT will impact both academic achievement and social emotional 
growth? Be sure to construct the goal to be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019 participating ELT students, including SPED and ELL population, will increase their ELA and Math results 
by 5%, as measured by state mock exams, scaffold supported resources in instruction, iReady data, and classroom 
observations.

Part 2b. Describe how the school will meet the NYCDOE requirements for a Community School in the School Renewal 
program. 
1. 

Renewal Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and together 
with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will lead 
implementation of the asset and needs  assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Renewal Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs  assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Renewal Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and families 
feel welcome,  actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of their 
schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community

School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this  family 
engagement strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Renewal School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work. 

We will be pairing up with Partnership with Children. Through Partnership with Children, Social workers conduct 
assessments of student needs by gathering information from a variety of sources including school administrator, 
teachers, parents, direct observation of and interaction with students, and analysis of relevant student data. Under 
the direct care of licensed Master level Social Workers, Students are then triaged into the appropriate level of care, 
with parent consent. Students with the highest level of need, for example, students with debilitating psychiatric 
issues, are referred to mental health services outside of the school. The next level of service is individual counseling. 
Social workers meet with assigned students once a week for 45-min sessions to work on social, behavioral, emotional, 
academic, family, and attendance goals. Social workers may have more frequent contact with these students for 
urgent behavioral intervention or crisis intervention. The next level of service is small group counseling. Social 
workers facilitate social-emotional learning lessons that help students build social skills, provide tools to effectively 
express themselves and manage conflict, and teach students leadership skills. 

Social workers also provide classroom-based interventions around topics such as Respect for All, Anti-Bullying, and 
Healthy Relationships. Partnership with Children staff are available to direct all students and families to needed 
concrete resources such as health care clinics, housing resources, legal aid, and emergency assistance programs. 
Social workers will attend appointments with families to act as advocates and to assist in navigating systems. 
Partnership with Children also participates in planning and hosting school-wide events and field trips that promote 
positive school culture and expose students to activities that enrich their lives. 

 

 
 
Part 3 – Community School Program Implementation and Oversight

3.  Explain data strategies including the use of the data sorter, and steps that the school will take to ensure that the 

appropriate interventions are provided to the right students 

Master Social Workers and staff from Partnership with Children and School Administrators will ensure the 
implementation of these programs as well as oversee their implementation. Each year, Partnership with Children 
conducts parent surveys to determine parent satisfaction with services provided and to identify gaps. Partnership 
with Children also has a consultant conduct phone interviews with a group of parents to gather more detailed 
information about their experiences with the program. 

 

Brownsville Jobs Plus provided a 4-week job readiness program to the parents of our school. They also hosted job 
fairs that enabled parents to network and be exposed to the various job opportunities in the community. Social 
service assessments were also provided to parents, giving them the opportunity to apply and obtain food assistance, 
metro cards, and proper attire for interviews. They also worked with parents to create proper resumes and prepare 
for employment opportunities.

Our after school program, called Team First, provided opportunities for our students to receive academic support as 
well as opportunities to engage in sports and arts activities. Team First provided our athletically skilled students with 
mentors that monitored their academic achievement throughout the year.  

 

Pens of Power provided literacy support and mentoring opportunities for our students, during Extended Learning 
Time on Wednesdays from 8:15-9:15am. Through continuous creative writing tasks and the PBIS model of Citizenship, 
Pride and Respect, students worked collaboratively to create a final project that consisted of 3 original songs and a 
music video. 

 

Project Blue is our conflict resolution program associated with the 73rd precinct, where students have an opportunity 
to discuss how to handle conflicts and build better relationships with others. Students also engage in peer to peer 
activities to promote social and communication skills. 

 

Our female students also participated in Girls' Inc., which is a year long program that engages them in social 
emotional, citizenship, and leadership related activities and projects. At the end of the program in the 2017-2018 
school year, due to an abundance of interest and participation, it was decided that a full program will be initiated for 
the Fall.  

 

The Open Door Positive Social Media Group provided a teaching artist to our school. Students were given the 
opportunity to work with social media to post positive and empowering posts about the school community and the 
events taking place. Students were responsible for all of the social media advertising for our Community School 
Forum, which meant leadership responsibility that encouraged positive attitudes and social media use. Students 
experienced both the technological aspect of this, as well as the importance of cyber safety and digital responsibility.  

 

Community School Team meetings are held once a month, following PTA meetings in our schools, to ensure parent 
involvement and voice, Our Community School team consists of the following members:

Use of the data sorter helps us a great deal by identifying patterns in absences, as well as the individual students that 
were absent often. In addition, we were able to compare this year's attendance trends with the history of attendance 
trends from previous years. We were able to identify circumstances that would normally fall under the radar, 
including sudden family illnesses that prevented consistent attendance of students, homelessness, and chronic 
illnesses of student or parent. Data sorter helped us to prioritize shelter visits and build communication with DOE 
staff working at these shelters to ensure open lines of communication and consistent feedback and updates.  

 

 
Part 3b. Indicate resources needed including human resources, instructional resources, and schedule adjustments to 
implement the Community School program. 
Staff development, support for relationship building with parents, more parental support and continuous open lines

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (RSCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/RSCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          65 

 

available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 11: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent lvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents 
and community in the school. PS 298, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student 
Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent lvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S. 298 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          67 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          68 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between /teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P.S. 298 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At PS. 298, we use various assessments tools to drive instruction. Early literacy skills of the ELLs are assessed through a variety 
of methods.  During the admission process, parents and students are interviewed with comprehensive questions centering 
their education background history and possibly SIFE status using questions from the SIFE Identification questionaire.  Literacy 
skills are further assessed using results from Performance Based Assessment TC- Running records, Fundations Unit Test 
(Phonics), Go Math End of chapter Test, the NYSESLAT modalities (RLAT) report, and teacher created assessments.  Results 
from the above mentioned assessments are used on conferencing and planning with teachers sharing the flagged students in 
need of extra supports and allow a deeper understanding of the ELLs first and second language needs as a whole.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The school leader ensures and supports the quality implementation of a systematic plan of rigorous and coherent curricula 
appropriately aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS) that is monitored and adapted to meet the needs of all 

2018-19 RSCEP-PF 

 

 

 

          75 

 

 

students. Teachers implement a comprehensive system for using formative and summative assessments for strategic short 
and long-range curriculum planning that involves student reflection, tracking of, and ownership of learning. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Common preparation periods are set where our certified ENL teacher brings in data analysis of the ELLs progress in all four 
components (listening, speaking, reading, and writing). From the results of the NSESLAT, Periodic Assessment, NYS ELA/math 
and teachers created assessments we are able to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of our ELLs. At PS. 298, there is need 
for improvement in reading and writing modalities; our certified ESL teacher is intensely working to meet the students' needs 
in reading comprehension and in writing skills.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

School leader and teachers  ensure that instructional practices and strategies are organized around annual, unit, and daily 
lesson plans that address students' goals and needs.  Teachers provide coherent, and appropriately aligned Common Core 
Learning Standards (CCLS)- based instruction that leads to multiple entry-points for all students. Teachers and students work 
together to implement a program/plan to create a learning environment that is responsive to students' varied experiences and 
tailored to the strengths and needs of all students. Teachers inform planning and foster students' paticipation in their own 
learning process. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Tier 1, Results from Literacy skills Assessments are used for planning and to drive instruction.  (RtI)  for ELLS (k-5), classroom 
teachers plan and set realistic goals to meet the needs of students.  Student population is subdivided in smaller groups aiming 
the goal of learning. Language and vocabulary development are skills promoted throughout the day.  Assessments used are: TC 
Running records, Fundations Unit Test (Phonics), NYSESLAT modalities, RLAT reports.  Tier 2, our AIS cerified teacher ensure 
that interventions are sufficiently intense.  Intervention provided for a minimum of thirty minutes each day.  Tier 3, a certified 
teacher in addition to our certified ESL teacher work intensely to meet students'needs.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
According to the NYSITELL and the NSESLAT Exam History (RLAR), 47% of our ELLs (Grades K-5) scored at the Beginner level, 
18%  Intermediate level, and 35% at Advanced level. These numbers drive instructions, aiming primarily weaknesses in reading 
comprehension and writing skills.  These numbers raise questions in the instructional decisions aimed to remediate needs of 
students.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Needs of ELLs are taken in consideration at PS.298K. Students receive their mandated ENL Services plus additional support that 
are provided by extended learning time or after school. Teaches will build on ELLs prior knowledge in addition to graphic 
organizers, hands on materials, audio teaching materials used to foster language acquisition to enhance students' cognitive 
and academic development. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).

          76 

 

 

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction for ELLs is delivered in ways to accommodate individual learning styles. (e.g., visual, auditory and 
kinesthetic). Instruction models for ELLs rely on TC workshop model, differentiated instruction and using different 
entry points (modalities of language learning, listening, speaking, reading, and writing). At  PS 298K, the Department 
of Education requires the use of Core Curriculum Standards grade level in reading, writing, listening and speaking.  A 
variety of structures, i.e., read-aloud, guided reading, shared reading, individual and small group conferences.  PS. 
298K, has self contained classes; Supplemental services are provided by both Push-in and Pull our certified staff 
members.  The ELL teacher works collaboratively with classroom teacher align instruction to the needs of ELLs. Our 
classes are heterogeneously grouped.  Stand- alone ENL is implemented through pullout sessions, where students 
serviced in group sessions with ENL teacher.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

TBE  program does not apply at PS298K.   

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

                              Instructional minutes are delivered accordingly.  Entering/Emerging English Proficiency levels  receive 2 units 
of study or 360 minutes per week. Transitioning and Expanding English Proficiency Levels 1unit of study or 180 minutes per 
week from our ESL teacher in addition to 1unit of study by an ESOL and Common Branch (K-6) teacher. The Home Language 
support mandated as per Regulations Part 154-2 (K-8).    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
                Our school provides a Free Standing ESL Program.  The Free Standing ESL program is taught in English and students 
are encouraged to transfer the language skills from their first language to the target language, English.  Students may use their 
native language for better understanding of ideas; however, strong emphasis is placed on English usage in all 
modalities.  Students are assessed on regular basis and assessment results are used by our certified teachers during common 
preps to better plan instruvtion. Materials are aligned with the New Core Learning Standards and multiple entry points are 
expected throughout teaching.  The ESL teacher meets with content area teachers during common preps for planning.  With 
Common Core aligned materials, vocabulary development, glossaries, dictionaries, and visual aids, the ESL teacher uses 
multiple entry points to better support ELLs in the content area subjects.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

                To ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native languages the Spanish LAB-R is offered to students, 
Math and Science exams are provided in native language, bilingual dictionaries, content area glossaries in native language are 
available.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. SIFE students will receive an extra period of instruction each day from the certified ESL instructor.  The certified ESL teacher 
will use this time to assist SIFE students in introducing or reinforcing content and strategies that may have been missed during 
their academic interruptin.  Strategies such as scaffolding, modeling, bridging, contextualization of new concepts, and schema 
building are used to enhance academic development of SIFE students to accerlerate language and academic development.

b.The NYSITELL determines newcomer's eligibility for ESL service.  New enrollees, in particular student who fall into the 
category of elogibility for the NYS exams required exceptional attention.  Total physical Response, visual aids, graphic 
organizers, vocavulary development, read aloud, and repetition will be used to enhance comprehension and learning. 
c. Vocabulary Development, graphic organizers, comprehension strategies and reading strategies/ skills enhancing 
comprehension will be tools for the ESL Teacher in collaboration with classroom teachers to work with ELLs in the Deloping 
stage. 
d.Long Term ELLs  will receive differentiated instructions based on multiple entry points and tes taking strategies.  Data from 
NYS exams, analysis of the NYSESLAT modalities, RLAT- RNMR reports will enable our certified ESL teacher in collaboration 
with classroom teachers to effectively target students's weakness. 
e. Former ELLs up to two years will receive support from the ESL teacher as needed and mandated testing accomodations will 
be adhere to by our testing staff.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs idencified as having special needs, goals stated on their IEP are taken into consideration as well as their need as indicated 
by the results of their NYSESLAT and NYSITELL.  Students will receive their mandated ESL services plus additional support that 
will be provided through AIS, related services, extended learning time or after school.  ELLs with altrnative placement, visual 
aids, graphic organizers, hands on materials, audio teaching materials are used to foster language acquisition. Prior knowledge 
will be used to enance students' cognitive and academic development.   
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In mathematics, ELLs identified as having special needs will receive instruction according to the needs listed on their individual 
educational plan. A more hands-on approach with clearly labeled manipulatives will assist the student in grasping concepts 
more quickly.  Teachers of students with special needs will meet with our cerified ESL teachwer to ensure students receive the 
mandated minutes.  Programming and scheduling are taken in consideration by the ICT techers and the ESL taeacher in order 
to better meet the studetns' meeds as recommended on their IEP. Students with disabilities are scheduled 1        st       and 2        
nd       periods ensuring they receive their mandated minutes.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Jonathan Dill, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In compliance with the Chancellor's Regulation A-663, PS. 298K uses the following data and methods to assess 
written and oral interpretation needs of parents: 1.Collecting data regarding Language of Preference Survey 
indicating parents' primary language spoken at home with children and whether such parents require language 
assistance to communicate with the DOE. 2. Making available translation and interpretation services for parents. 
Our certified ESL Teacher/ NYC Certified Interpreter/Translator Ms. Gabriel provides translation in French and in 
Haitian Creole, Ms. Henry Wright to translate for Spanish speakers, Multilingual Language Access flyers and 
brochures to parents, posting DOE/ Translation and Interpretation Unit's telephone nymber by the safety agents' 
desk. 3. Develop a school-based language access plan aligned to Part III of the Home Language Identification 
Survey questions pertaining to parents' language of choice with school staff. Student Emergency Contact cards are 
completed and noted identifying parents' particular language preference at registration. 4.Increasing parental 
awareness regarding their rights, the availabily of translation and interpretation services during business hours. 5. 
Maintaining records regarding the provision of language assistance to monitor changes and progress.

indicates a language of 
preference other than 
English in part III of the 
(HLIS), copies of that home 
language survey are made 
and kept by Ms. Gabriel and 
our parent coordinator. 
Currently at PS.298, the 
preferred languages of 
parents are: English, 
Bengali, Arabic, and 
Spanish.  

   

 

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English,
