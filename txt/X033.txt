Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

Instructional Focus: Higher Order Thinking 

 

If ALL students consistently engage in tasks that require critical thinking and high levels of discussions with precise 
language through project base learning, and teachers consistently plan and provide learning tasks that reflect DOK 
Level 3 and 4 rigor, then our students will increase achievement across all content areas, that will result in an 
increase of 7% on their New York State Assessments.  

MISSION STATEMENT 2018-2019 

IT IS THE MISSION OF P.S 33 TO CREATE A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WHERE ALL MEMBERS OF THE LEARNING 
COMMUNITY ARE ACTIVELY IMMERSED IN THE LEARNING PROCESS WITH THE SHARED GOAL OF MEETING AND 
SURPASSING ACADEMIC STANDARDS. MEMBERS OF THE LEARNING COMMUNITY ARE COMMITTED TO REACH 
THEIR FULL POTENTIAL AS LEARNERS AND INFLUENTIAL CITIZENS OF THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY. 

 

VISION STATEMENT 2018-2019 

IT IS THE VISION OF P.S 33 TO PREPARE ALL STUDENTS TO BECOME CRITICAL THINKERS AND PROBLEM SOLVERS IN 
THE 21ST CENTURY. CHILDREN WILL LEARN HOW TO LEARN--THAT IS TO OBSERVE, ANALYZE, PROBLEM SOLVE AND 
SELF-ASSESS. OUR VISION IS FOR OUR STUDENTS TO BECOME LITERATE CITIZENS WHO WILL LEAD THEIR 
IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY AND THE GREATER WORLD. IN ORDER TO REACH OUR ATTAINABLE GOALS WE MUST: 

 

 

 

  HELP ALL STUDENTS DEVELOP THEIR CRITICAL THINKING ABILITIES 
  ENGAGE STUDENTS IN MEANINGFUL HANDS-ON AND MINDS-ON ACTIVITIES USING LEARNING 

TECHNOLOGIES, MULTIMEDIA RESOURCES, MANIPULATIVES, AND OTHER LEARNING TOOLS  

  PROVIDE A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT WHERE ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE IS THE NORM  
  NURTURE A SCHOOL CULTURE THAT FOSTERS AND MAINTAINS CARE, CONCERN AND RESPECT AMONG 

STUDENTS, PARENTS AND STAFF, AS WELL AS OTHER WITHIN THE LEARNING COMMUNITY. 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 33, is a neighborhood school with 850 students in PreK-5 who are from diverse backgrounds. The student body is 
85% Latino/a. 10% Black, 1% White, 2% Asian and 2% Other; 30% of our students are English Language Learners (ELLs) 
and 20% are Students with Disabilities (SWDs). This school is at 170% its capacity. Though overcrowded, our is a 
school that continues to welcome families situated on Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue in the Northern section of 
the Bronx. P.S. 33 participates in the Title I Program, which enables us to upgrade our instructional program for all 
students in the school by working collaboratively to develop a comprehensive plan for instructional reform. We have

All the initiatives at our school are created to help our students gain the skills necessary to meet and exceed the 
Common Core Learning Standards. This our third year implementing our RTI/Passport Voyager Sopris program in 
which students will be grouped based on independent reading level in order to improve their reading. This program 
will help our ELL students and Students with Disabilities to gain a good grasp of the foundations of learning to read 
and move them closer to proficiency.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

With one of the largest populations of low socioeconomic families, P.S. 33’s children come from an economically 
disadvantaged community. Although the neighborhood in which P.S. 33 is located is diverse in terms of ethnicity, it is 
comprised predominantly of minorities from Latin Caribbean countries as well as countries in South and Central 
America. Many of them are recent immigrants to the United States. our population also includes African American 
students and immigrants from Asia and West Africa. A good percentage of our students are struggling with the 
acquisition and fluency of the English language. We have 15% of ELLS at the Commanding Level; 31% at the Expanding 
Level; 18% at the Transitioning Level; 15% at the Emerging Level and 20% at the Entering Level. To support our ELLS 
we have transitional bilingual programs in grades K-5 and ENL push in services for our students. Our Students with 
Disabilities are challenged with the foundations of reading and writiing. In addition our SWDs needs support with their 
social emotional needs as well. To support our Students with Disabilities, we have SETTS, Speech , Guidance, Physical 
and Occupational Therapy, Least Restrictive Collaborative Team Teaching Classrooms Grades K-5 and Self-Contained 
Classes K-5. Our PBIS, Cloud 9 World and RULER, Social Emotional Initiatives support our students with regulating 
their behavior and emotions. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In our most current Framework for Great Schools Survey our area of focus is Strong Family and community ties. There 
is much room for improvement in this area. We will work on our Parental Involvement in our School. Through the use 
of our Tuesday 35 minutes we will continue to schedule appointments for our outreach to our parents. Our Teachers 
and Parent Coordinator will provide Monthly ELA and Math Workshops by grade levels to our families. This will 
support our school with meeting our school wide goals. Leadership will continue to bring resources, from our 
community into the school building that welcomes, encourages, and develops partnership with families, businesses, 
and community-based organizations.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Upon reviewing Tenet 3, Rigorous Instruction, our Central-Led - Quality Review , indicated that we have strengthened 
the statement of practices in the past several years. School leaders and teachers have refined curricula and academic 
tasks based on data analysis derived from student work in order to address the needs of all students. Teachers 
implemented rigorous tasks that included higher order thinking skills, aligned to curricula and CCLS across grades and 
subjects so that all learners were able to demonstrate their thinking.  

 

We will continue to grow in the indicated areas: 

  Teacher teams consistently engaged in professional collaboration that includes the examination of student work 

and the use of assessment results to effectively adjust curricula that are Culturally Responsive to students' 
needs, resulting in school-wide instructional coherence to increase student achievement for all students 
including students with disabilities and English language learners. 

  Teachers will continue to develop and ensure unit lesson plans include data driven instruction (DDI) protocols 

that are appropriately aligned to the CCLS and the NYS Content standards.

NYC Department of Education. Through this program students are aware of the rules of the school and 
rewarded for proper conduct with “Stars” which can be traded for tangible items from the Star Store. 

  Utilize research based "RULER" program for all stakeholders to ensure that all are able to self-regulate our 

emotions and work towards students' ability to self-regulate their emotions through the use of the Mood Meter 
and The Meta-Moment Strategy. 

  Utilize our Cloud 9 World Research Based Social Emotional Character Development Program, to support 

students with developing their character traits through monthly school wide implementation. 

  Developing the whole child is a very important part of our school community so we have expanded our arts 
leadership team. This expanded team is expected to offer several opportunities to our students to express 
themselves through the arts with a special emphasis on reaching our high-risk students. Students will participate 
in assembly shows, Holiday Concerts, Art Gallery Displays, Arts and Dance Festivals, and outreach to various 
community organizations such as the Veteran’s Hospital, Home of the Aged, Botanical Gardens, etc.

  Utilizing our in-school and after-school sports programs (basketball in the fall and tennis in the spring) to expose 

students to team building and leadership opportunities. 

  Our Junior and Senior patrol is another initiative that builds teamwork and promotes leadership in our school. 

Although these supports are in place, based on the Framework for great schools report 2017 only 52% of teachers who 
teach students in grades pre-k through 5 agreed or strongly agreed that discipline is applied to students fairly in their 
school. Our plan this year is to strengthen our commitment and follow through with the programs and plans that we 
have already established in order to create a more supportive environment.

report on students living in temporary housing (STH). For more information on using Title I set-aside funds to support 
your STH population, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions document on DOE's website: 
http://schools.nyc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/8D99859A-AE04-40EA-A462-5363F87E67E9/0/FAQTitleISetAsideFY14.pdf   

Part A: FOR TITLE I SCHOOLS 

 

1. Please identify the number of Students in Temporary Housing who are currently attending your 
school. (Please note that your current STH population may not be the same as officially reported in DOE 
systems and may change over the course of the year.) 

We 
currently 
have 49 
students 
in 
temporary 
housing. 

 

2. Please describe the services you are planning to provide to the STH population. 

In addition to the services that we provide all families, we provide these families with assistance in obtaining school 
supplies, uniforms, cover class trip expenses. We provide counseling using our Social Worker and family worker. We 
also provide instructional materials, backpacks with school supplies. To get to and from school we offer transportation 
choices, such as metro card or school bus services. We work closely with our Parent Association in helping to met

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
During the year our high quality professional development will utilize the process of instructional rounds, peer review 
and cycle of inquiry to support teacher teams with best teaching practices on multiple entry points and questioning 
and discussion techniques. Professional development activities will support teachers on how to identify how students 
learn best, develop their higher order thinking ability, and engage actively in their own learning. 

 

Part of our hiring process in to involve the NYC Recruitment fairs to support with possible candidates. Resumes are 
reviewed and rated, followed by interviews and teaching a demonstration lesson for final rating. A successful hiring 
process leads to securing the most qualified candidate to fill each vacancy. Each year 1 teacher receives 1:1 mentoring 
by school-based staff. Our focus this year is on teacher effectiveness and development. All staff is trained 
professionally on writing and conducting successful lessons in our Literacy Programs, which includes but not limited to 
the workshop model using the Fisher and Frey model for mini-lessons. We strongly believe cooperative project-based 
learning, small group instruction and guided reading are best practices to maximize student progress and 
achievement in reading. 

 

Some of our Professional Development Initiatives/topics are: 

Common Core ELA (Social Studies-Passport Program, Science Dimensions Program, Supplemental Classroom 

Universal Literacy K-2, Libraries on Topics of Units of Study ) & Math (Go Math)

Teachers are given planning periods that are common preps. This support teachers with opportunities to plan lessons, 
create common formative assessments and make other instructional decisions. It also aligns teaching across 
classrooms on the grades and affords a forum for highlighting success and sharing best practices, as well as 
developing leadership and team building skills among teachers.  Teachers use their cycles of inquiry to analyze their 
baseline, mid-line and end-line assessments that supports their share of best teaching practices. Teacher implement 
the agreed teaching strategies and revisit students' work for indicators of progress. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           46 

 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan.

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 33, Timothy Dwight Elementary School, in compliance with the Section 1118 
of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

 

 

P.S. 33, Timothy Dwight Elementary School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           49 

 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           50 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

  We plan on implementing an ELL After-School Enrichment Program. This program is 
scheduled for Wednesdays and Thursdays for 1.5  hours each day. This program is set to run 
from October 10, 2018 to May 9, 2019  for 48 sessions. Based on our school data analysis, 
NYSITELL, NYSESLAT, school student ELL registration, Fountas and Pinnell  reading 
assessments as well as Grades 3, 4 & 5 ELA/Math State Exams, we find that there is a need to 
support our ELL student's learning and address the needs of the following student population: 
  
     * Students with limited verse of the English Language based on the NYSITELL and 
NYSESLAT, specifically writing as the weakness modality  
     * Students that scored in the Emerging and Entering levels on the NYSESLAT on the 
modalities of reading and writing. 
     * Students that scored Expanding in the NYSESLAT and high level 2 in the ELA and Math 
State exams.  
     * Students that scored a level 1 &2 in the NYS Math Test. 
  
      Each sub-group has a specific program tailored to their needs as follows: 
  
We plan on having two classes per grade in which students are grouped by proficiency based on 
their NYSITELL/ NYSESLAT results. One class will comprised of Entering& Emerging & 
SIFE  ELLs and the other class will be comprised of Transitioning and Expanding ELL's.  
 
 
Emerging, Entering,SIFE  students are provided with the following supports and materials :

on phonological                awareness, vocabulary, fluency, sight words, and reading and writing 
comprehension. 
     *  ELL proficiency practice program to address English language proficiency standards. 
Materials to be used are         Continental Press,  and Finish Line for ELLs.  Lessons are 
developed to be extended  around specific content           topic or themes that are grade 
level  appropriate, aligned to the NYC scope and sequences for social studies           and 
science,  and addressed by the CCLS.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The assessment tools P.S 33 uses to assess early literacy skills for ELLs are Fountas and Pinnell,  Gates-Mac assessment, 
running records, and the school wide bi/weekly assessments that are are aligned to the units of study which follow the NYC 
scope and sequence in Social Studies and Science.  The school wide assessments provide detailed information on student’s 
literacy progress. Teachers analyze  ELA and Math data from the assessments in their Data Inquiry teams which is the main 
focus of their weekly grade level meetings. The results of the data analysis informs the school about the student’s strengths 
and challenges. It also provides data to guide differentiation and small group instruction. In addition, ELL's take periodic

math  retention battery assessments that when scored give teachers valuable data on student progress. After careful review of 
our ELL Data we determine that 78.5% of our ELL students are reading at levels that fall below 2-3 grade levels. We also 
determine that their English writing skills lack behind the Non-ELL student population ( due to the difficulty/complexity of the 
new exam).  We do however see that students continue to show growth in listening and speaking. This is due in part to our 
school program set up after the new Par154 which consists of  ENL/ESL Integrated and Stand Alone classes. The Bilingual 
classes utilize the Stand Alone hours to provide vocabulary in all four modalities (listening, speaking, reading a dn writing) 
and  that increase the learning strategy skill of translanguaging.  We will continue to focus on ELL vocabulary development , 
reading and writing skills utilizing differentiated instruction with use of RTI and approved research resources that will enhance 
the instructional practices of our staff and ELL student learning.      
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers in all grades participate in a weekly meeting focused on data analysis and ENL teachers have preps to align to these 
times so they can participate and collaborate in the process.  At these meetings, teachers bring samples of students work from 
assessments in ELA and Math and report their initial findings to their colleagues. Teachers  then identify student challenges 
and successes collaboratively in order to identify patterns. From the identified patterns, teachers prioritize student needs and 
develop targeted  intervention plans to address student needs. The intervention plans are implemented in the classroom  with 
students, and 2-3 weeks later teachers collectively review the successes and challenges of the targeted intervention 
plan.  Intervention plans, grade level meetings,  agendas, and student work samples are reviewed by the administrative team 
to further the support and success of the students.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The current areas of need for ELLs according to data from the EDAT are reading and writing  
The following assessments help us to evaluate ELL progress and areas of need:•              Fountas and Pinnell (F&P)reading 
data •               NYSITELL/NYSESLAT•               NYS ELA Exam•               NYS Mathematics Exam•               Go Math End of Chapter 
Assessments 
 
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

These assessments are reviewed and evaluated by our ELL teachers during their grade level meetings and to track the progress 
of our ELL students and plan differentiated lessons in different subject areas . In addition  ELL/ENL teachers from our after 
school ELL program utilize the results of the these tests to identify the focus for each instructional session and for guided 
instruction.     
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
As stated above, teachers  analyze results of the bi-weekly assessments in ELA and Math during their Data Inquiry team weekly 
grade level meetings to differentiate instruction as needed.  It is the expectation in our school that teachers informally assess 
student performance throughout the lesson to see which students need additional support and how to provide differentiation 
on the spot with regards to that day’s topic. In addition to that, the GO Math program provides specific Tier 1, 2, and 3 
activities as well an ESL section that the teacher can use to provide suitable scaffold to these type of students. With regards 
to the common core curriculum, we include the new ELL common core curriculum into our pacing calendars for instructional 
planning which integrates various ESL methodologies. The school utilizes the TOMs, the New Language Arts Progressions, and 
the Home Language Arts Progressions to help drive instruction for RTIs and after-school programming. Student assessments 
are carefully monitored to enable differentiated instruction based on the Tier level of need. In addition, our school has a RTI 
team which consist of staff members who are qualified in specialty areas to assist in planning a strategic action plan for at risk 
students.  Finally, our school implements a three day RTI program to help narrow the students' gap in literacy using the 
researched-based Voyager Passport program. Students are grouped by their reading and language proficiency levels.

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Below are the results for the 2017 NYSESLAT administration by grade:

Administrators and teacher teams analyze the NYSESLAT data to begin with when evaluating the needs of the ELL students in 
our school. Our school's data specialist provides teachers in grades 3-5 with detailed data of student performance on running 
record assessments, NYS Math & ELA, which gives teachers and administrators a deeper understanding of the the teacher's 
needs. The student outcome and item analysis data is then used to inform curriculum maps, lesson plans, and units of study 
across content areas.  In addition to that, in September, all teachers receive student achievement data from the previous 
school year and make guided groups in each of the content areas. Students receive differentiated instruction in all content 
areas and as teachers deliver lessons they collect formative data( exit tickets, quizzes, reflections, etc.) on student 
performance to inform their  future instruction. ELL's that are struggling academically in any of the content area received 
intensive intervention in small groups. Students that do not make progress are referred to the School Improvement Team (SIT) 
committee which is composed of  a school psychologist, school social worker, IEP teacher, an assistant principal, ENL teacher, 
classroom teacher, guidance counselor, and the student's parent. At this meeting student data and work samples are reviewed 
and discussed. The SIT committee develops an action plan for the student which often includes social-emotional support from 
the social worker and at-risk academic intervention with an I.E.P. teacher in small groups and/or in a one to one setting. In 6-8 
weeks, the SIT committee reconvenes to monitor student progress and determine next steps for the student which can include 
continuation of at-risk services as well as to consider a referral for special education services.  Patterns depict that we have 
across the grades a large amount of students transitioning with large scales advancing in the areas of listening and 
speaking.  This year we also had an increase of new Ell arrivals which account for the large number of students faring in the 
beginning levels of language.  Our 
2  nd   and 5th   grades have the highest percentage of commanding. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The school's data specialist, ELL coordinator, and Assistant Principal for English Language Learners review NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, 
and student end line assessments utilizing the EDAT. The ELL coordinator and Assistant Principal attended the EDAT training 
offered by the Division of English Language Learners and turn-keyed findings to all teachers of English Language Learners. 
Teachers reviewed the EDAT data to identify at-risk students since the EDAT provided teachers with NYSESLAT, NYSITELL, NYS 
Math, NYS ELA and attendance data. Teachers used this data to target areas on need of improvement/differentiation 
accordingly. This approach assisted in bolstering student achievement.

Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Here at PS 33, we have four ENL classes that are grouped heterogeneously in grades K- 5.  These classes 
offer academic instruction during the entire school day (by an ESL certified teacher) in English which exceeds the 
maximum amount of mandated Stand-Alone ENL minutes/unit.  In grades K-5, an ENL teacher pushes in to co-teach 
the mandated Integrated ENL minutes/unit.  In grade K, the teacher is dual certified (ESOL and Common Branch) and 
provides both Stand-Alone ENL and Integrated ENL to his students.  For ENL/ESL students in grades K-5 who are not in 
one of these classes, students are grouped according to grade and English proficiency level (i.e. Students who are at 
an Entering/Emerging language proficiency level are serviced as a group and receive 360 minutes of servicing; 2 - 90 
minute period blocks (4x) a week, Transitioning and Expanding are grouped and receive 180 minutes of servicing; 1- 
45 minute block (4x), Commanding receive 90 minutes of servicing; 1 - 45 minute block (2x) a week).  Our four ENL 
providers plan instruction to meet the needs of students based on assessment test data analysis.  Teachers co-plan 
Integrated ENL lessons using the school developed ELA curriculum. ENL teachers identify and deliver the 
language  and content objectives for lessons and units of study. They also meet with classroom teachers to discuss 
student needs and to plan differentiated  instruction for each sub-group  utilizing  resources such as Explode the 
Code, Great Source, books,  Sadlier materials...All content area/subjects are taught utilizing ENL 
methodologies/approaches. Since students placed in these programs receive all their instruction in English, ongoing 
support is provided to better serve their needs. We have afternoon RTI as well as an After School ELL Enrichment 
Program that focuses on building student vocabulary.  We provide our staff/class with additional resources such as 
Avenues, Fundations, Finish Line for ELL’s, Ready, and Getting Ready for NYSESLAT,  and Beyond to support instruction 
in our ENL component.  We also utilize technology in our daily instruction.  Teachers have a smart board in their 
classroom (which is used in many ways to support instruction.  One way teachers use it is to connect to an on-line 
reading program  called MyOn - which allows students to select reading materials at their independent reading levels 
in English and Spanish.  It also allows students to access these accounts at home, making it a home-school resource. 
Additionally, each floor has a minimum of 2 laptop carts for additional student support.  Teachers often convert 
the computer centers to listening centers with read aloud stories of various genres to facilitate the differentiated 
learning styles in his/her class.   
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Transitional Bilingual classes are organized heterogeneous by grade. We provide a transitional bilingual program for 
grades K-5. This program offers academic instruction in the student’s native language (Spanish) along with intensive 
ENL/ESL instruction.  Students with limited English proficiency spend 40 to 45 percent of their time in English language 
development and the remaining time is utilized for instruction in their native language.  Students that are at the 
beginner level of English proficiency are given enhanced opportunities to develop their second language learning. 
through a project-based curriculum that allows teachers to accommodate all different language proficiency levels 
during lessons.  Native language instruction decreases as the student’s level of English proficiency increases. Since we 
have heterogeneous Bilingual classes, the classroom teacher immediately plans lessons for differentiation of 
instruction and utilizes various resources, i.e., Internet, technology and sound research based 
materials,  Fundations, Avenues, and Finish line for ELL’s for classroom instruction. Bilingual classroom teachers utilize 
the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT test score data to develop class groups that emphasize peer to peer teaching. The teacher 
assesses students in NLA/ENL  to monitor progress and growth. Our school has developed a curriculum for every

subject in every grade, as well as a strategy/skill of the week. Our  
Bilingual and ENL/ESL classes are required to follow the curriculum calendar and incorporate NLA/ENL core standards 
and methodologies. In order to have our bilingual students retain their native Language skills, we continue to 
incorporate “Estrellita Accelerated Beginning Spanish Reading” program for grades K-2.   This intense program comes 
with year long assessments, test and benchmarks for every student. It also incorporates specific time lines that 
implements the curriculum and monitors students’ progress to ensure that 80% of the students are mastering specific 
skills in their native language. It also has a huge parent component program that requires parents daily involvement in 
their child’s learning.  The teacher also reviews students’ assessment to plan accordingly.  As far as the NLA and ENL 
instructional components are concerned,  teachers decide based on their students’ assessment which subject matter 
to teach in specific language.  For most classes the content area taught in HLA is Arithmetic/Mathematics and Social 
Studies. They all follow the NYS CR-Part 154 mandated number of units of support for ELL’s as required.  Students are 
appropriately evaluated in their native language as classroom teachers in the Bilingual classes develop their 
assessments/test, quizzes etc in the students native language, Spanish.  Our bilingual students also are allowed to 
select the language preference for their writing pieces that go in their student portfolios.

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

          
 We provide a Transitional Bilingual program for grades K-5. Transitional Bilingual classes are organized heterogeneous by 
grade.This program provides academic instruction in the student’s native language (Spanish) along with intensive ESL 
instruction. TBE teacher schedules are developed by classroom teachers. At the beginning of the school year, the ELL 
coordinator and Assistant Principal for English Language Learners meet with the certified bilingual teachers and provide them 
with a sample schedule that is fully aligned to CR-Part 154-2. Teachers develop their individual class schedules around the 
school prep schedule and lunch but allot 4 periods for HLA, 4 periods of Stand Alone ENL, 4 periods of Integrated ENL/ELA,4 
periods of Math (Bilingual Content Area Subject-Spanish), and 4 periods of Social Studies/Science (Bilingual Content Area 
Subject- Spanish for Entering and Emerging ELLs and English for Transitioning and Expanding ELLs).  Each period is 45 minutes 
of instruction. Finalized TBE teacher schedules are reviewed by the Assistant Principal for English Language Learners to ensure 
complete alignment to CR Part 154-2 before being entered in STARS by the Testing Coordinator. Periodic walkthroughs are 
scheduled by administration and instructional coaches to ensure daily instruction is aligned to schedules that are on file in the 
Principal's Office.   
 
Since we have heterogeneous bilingual classes, the classroom teacher immediately plan lessons for differentiation of 
instruction and utilizes various resources, i.e., Internet, technology and sound research base materials, Fundations, Avenues, 
and Finish line for ELL’s for classroom instruction. Bilingual classroom teachers Utilize the NYSITELL & NYSESLAT test score data 
to develop class groups that emphasize peer to peer teaching. The teacher assesses students in both NLA and ENL/ESL to 
monitor progress and growth.   
  
In the Freestanding  ENL program, English Language Learners are grouped in 1-2 classes per grade in monolingual classes 
based on their proficiency level. ELL's with IEPs are placed in the class that corresponds to the mandates outlined in their 
respective IEPs. Entering and Emerging students are pulled out of their classes by a certified ENL teacher for 180 minutes a 
week in un-graded small groups composed of students with similar ability levels.  Teachers use Explode the Code, Great Source 
books, and Saddler materials to support their instruction. Entering, Emerging, Transitioning,  and Expanding  ELL's receive 
Integrated ENL instruction in their classrooms with two co-teachers (one certified ENL teacher and one certified common 
branches teacher) for 180 minutes (4 periods). Content area subjects are taught utilizing ENL/ESL methodologies for the entire

year. We provide our staff/class with additional resources such as the ‘Avenues’ Fundations , Finish line for ELL’s and getting 
ready for NYSESLAT and beyond to support instruction in our ESL component.  We also utilize technology in our daily 
instruction. Most teachers have a smart board in their classrooms and 4 computers for students support converting the 
computer center to listening centers with read aloud stories of various genres. They also have a on-line reading program 
called Myon that supports our ELL’s in acquiring their literacy skills in their native and second language. We also have traveling 
Lab tops on every floor.  
  
Our school has developed a curriculum for every subject in every grade, as well as a strategy of the week. Our Bilingual and 
classes with ENL students are required to follow the curriculum calendar and incorporate NLA and ENL  core standards and 
methodologies.  In order to support NLA students' acquisition of the new language, we continue utilizing the Accelerated 
Beginning Spanish Reading” Estrellitas' program for our k-2 bilingual classes. This intense program comes with year long 
assessments, test and benchmarks for every student. It also incorporates specific time lines that implements the curriculum 
and monitors students’ progress to ensure that 80% of the students are mastering specific skills in their native language. 
Teachers also review students’ assessments to plan accordingly. As far as the NLA and ENL instructional components are 
concerned, the school decided to teach Math and Social Studies in Spanish. They all follow the NYS CR-Part 154 Mandated 
Number of units of support for ELL’s as required. Students are appropriately evaluated in their native language as classroom 
teachers in the Bilingual classes develop their assessments/test, quizzes etc in the students native language, Spanish. Our 
bilingual students also are allowed to select the language preference for their writing pieces that go in their student 
portfolios.   
 
In addition, students whose parent’s exercise the option of withdrawing their children from the Bilingual program receive ENL 
support from the co-teaching programs. These students receive services from our licensed certified ENL teachers. These 
certified ENL teachers group students according to their instructional levels, Entering and Emergent receive 360 minutes of 
servicing; 2 - 90 minute period blocks (4x) a week, Transitioning and Expanding receive 180 minutes of servicing; 1- 45 minute 
block (4x), Commanding receive 90 minutes of servicing; 1 - 45 minute block (2x)  a week.  Our ELL providers plan instruction to 
meet the needs of students based on assessment test data analysis. They also meet with classroom teachers to discuss student 
needs and to plan differentiated instruction for each sub-group (utilizing the pre-mentioned resources).   
  
  
   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
  
Transitional Bilingual classes are organized by grade. We provide a transitional bilingual program for grades k-5, one class per 
grade. This program provides academic instruction in the student’s native language (Spanish) along with intensive ESL 
instruction. Students with limited English proficiency spend 40 to 45 percent of their time in English language development 
and remaining time is utilized for instruction in their native language. Students that are at the Entering and Emerging levels of 
English proficiency are given enhanced opportunities to develop their second language learning. Native language instruction 
decreases as the student’s level of English proficiency   
increases. Once the students have reached the Commanding level they will be placed in mainstream monolingual education. 
They are then motivated as long term ELL’s. Parent’s are notified and are given the option of allowing student’s to remain in 
the Bilingual program or move on into monolingual. Our school has developed a curriculum for every subject in every grade, as 
well as a strategy of the week.   We have also created bilingual reading logs to help support students as they develop their 
language and reading comprehension skills. Our Bilingual and monolingual classes with ENL students are required to follow the 
curriculum calendar and incorporate NLA/ ENL common core standards and methodologies. Teachers are also provided with 
the NYSESLAT test scores and are required to group student based on their levels and abilities. This ensures that all of our ELL 
students receive instruction in their levels and meet the state mandates. Students are provided math instruction in their

Native Language, as well as Social Studies and Literacy.  We also incorporated Estrellita to enhance our ELL student phonemic 
awareness, vocabulary and reading in their native language.  
 
Teachers in the ENL  and the Transitional Bilingual Education program use the Fisher& Frey gradual release model in their 
lessons across content areas.  Teachers of English Language Learners use ENL methodologies such as visuals, animated videos 
with captions, sentence frames, graphic organizers, modified texts, drawings, and bilingual glossaries, and cooperative 
learning.Teachers in the TBE program have a HLA period that is aligned to the ELA curriculum. HLA is taught earlier in the 
school day so concepts and ideas are pre-taught in the native language so students are able to transfer the content during the 
Integrated ENL lesson. Math is a Bilingual Content Area Subject that is taught in Spanish using the Go Math curriculum 
resources and is supplemented by Math Steps in Spanish and other teacher selected resources. The second Bilingual Content 
Area Subject is Social Studies in which students are taught using the guided reading approach. Students are grouped by the 
language proficiency level and most current Fountas & Pinnell reading level. Students that are Entering and Emerging are 
taught using materials in Spanish and students that are Transitioning and Expanding are taught using texts in English.   All of 
these strategies/approaches and methods along with our curriculum allow us to foster language development and meet the 
demands of the common core learning standards.  
 
We have also included a Bilingual para for classes that have an increased amount of new students. In the monolingual classes, 
we have ENL teachers who provide Stand-Alone and Integrated ENL accordingly.   All academic instruction during the entire 
school day is in English however, home language support is offered. Content area subjects are taught utilizing ENL 
methodologies. Since students placed in this program receive all their instruction in English, ongoing support is provided to 
better serve their needs. We have afternoon RTI, (Response to Intervention) that focuses on building student vocabulary.  In 
our monolingual classrooms, a certified ENL teacher provides English language skills and content area instruction utilizing ENL 
approaches the entire year. We provide our staff/ class with additional resources such as the ‘Avenues’ and Fundations to 
support instruction in our ENL component. Every class is also provided with listening and technology centers such as; smart 
boards and computers.  Students whose parents choose to withdraw them from a Transitional Bilingual program receive ENL 
support from the co-teaching model. (ENL/Monolingual Teacher) 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 English Language Learners  are appropriately evaluated in their native language utilizing our school bi-weekly assessments 
which are aligned to the ELA and Go Math curriculum which then are translated in their native language. TBE teachers have 
selected benchmark texts from their classroom libraries and also using benchmark Spanish texts from Reading A-Z and use 
them to conduct running records in Spanish.  Math assessments from the Go Math curriculum are administered to the 
students in Spanish. In addition all practice assessment materials are provided in Spanish.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
a. SIFE: There are currently two SIFE students enrolled at P. S. 33 Bronx. They are currently in TBE classrooms and are 
receiving RTIs three times a week to bolster their listening, speaking, reading and writing. They also have access to technology 
in the form of listening centers and lap tops to practice and drive home instruction. 
 
b. New Comers: 
 
For newcomers, bilingual and ENL teachers refer to the student's NYSITELL data and the Spanish LAP to identify areas of needs 
and target a specific language modality that the student needs the most support in. Teachers refer to the New Language Arts 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           68 

 

Progression for guidance on the most effective practices in teaching newcomers. Teachers plan lessons that include pre-taught 
vocabulary, visuals, and graphic organizers to support their receptive and productive language abilities.   In writing 
lessons,  teachers model how to Teachers use technology such as listening centers and websites to assist students in acquiring 
general and domain-specific vocabulary. In addition, teachers for newcomers use Fundations to support phonic awareness and 
vocabulary development.  Students receive intensive teacher-led support in small group instruction and native language 
support when necessary. Students are also paired up with students who have been in the US school system for longer in order 
to become better acclimated to the expectations of the school. 
 
We take great pride in informing parents of the need to maintain a consistent family atmosphere and the importance  of 
getting involved in their children's formal education.  These students are monitored carefully by their classroom teachers and 
paired up with students of similar backgrounds to help them become acclimated to the new school setting.  They also receive 
intense ENL instruction to further enhance or trigger what was taught in the past. Based on our school data, we have identified 
a few number of newcomers, students that have been enrolled in our school system for less than one year and have had little 
to no experience in a formal classroom/school setting. This lack of formal education has presented our school with many 
challenges.  These students lack the social skills needed to function in a classroom setting as well as academic knowledge of 
simple letter sounds, word recognition skills, and basic math skills. They are developmentally below in both academic and 
social skills. We have developed an Response to Intervention (RTI) program in our school to target the Newcomers. 
To further enhance their daily instruction as well as social emotional development the teacher, RTI team, and support staff 
work collaboratively. We provide these services to our students in a small classroom setting. We utilize a program called, 
"Fundations", published by  'Wilson Language training corporation'. This program addresses the essential components of 
reading instruction by implementing all five areas: Phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension 
strategies. They use a multi-sensory teaching approach, sequential and cumulative, motor memory learning, repetition and 
feedback. We also incorporate Estrellita program to build language development skills in their native language.   
 
Our bilingual SAPIS and Social Worker meet these students to support them with social skills and adapting to the new school. 
We will  also continue to provide intensive English language Instruction for our ELL students that are here a year and a day 
to prepare them for the ELA exam. 
 
c.Developing: 
 
Teachers refer to the student's most recent NYSESLAT, NYS ELA & Math, and school based and classroom based assessments 
to determine the student's language and content abilities. Teachers provide the students with copious models and examples, 
scaffolds, differentiated work, sentence starters, and engage students in peer to peer collaboration when producing projects 
based on the ELA curriculum which are aligned to science and social studies. Teachers occasionally provide native language 
support to Developing students which is a suggestion from the New Language Arts Progression. Students also participate in 
school wide RtI program which is an intensive small group instruction 
 
d. Long-Term:  As of 6/25/18 there are no Long-Term ELL's at P.S. 33. 
 
e. Former ELL's up to two years after exiting ELL status: 
 
Former ELLs receive their 90 minutes of Integrated ENL with a certified ENL teacher and classroom teacher in which students 
receive small group instruction. The Former ELL Plan, or "Alternative Pathways to Support Progress" is now being discussed for 
the upcoming school year 2018/2019 and how it will look for individual students and small group instruction. Student 
performance data such as Fountas & Pinnel reading levels are carefully monitored and if students additional support they are 
scheduled  for at-risk instruction in small groups with an ENL teacher. Former ELL' students are carefully monitored as they 
mainstream into monolingual classes. Students are provided with extra support and time in their academic as well as social 
needs.

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our school does not have a Bilingual Special Ed. class but we do have students that are ELL-SWD's.   Each ENL teacher 
is assigned to co-teach in Special Education classes to provide more rigorous intervention and comply with the mandated 
instructional units of CR-Part 154. As mentioned, our school has a school wide curriculum that is implemented in all of our 
instructional classes. The key is to provide differentiated instruction for all students at risk. Teacher’s are given access and or 
provided with an ELL-SWD’s, IEP plan and implement instruction based not only the academic needs of the ELL's -SWD's but 
also their emotional needs. After review of various DATA assessments tools and carefully monitoring student’s progress, if 
students do not show progress, teachers can refer students to our ‘School Improvement Team. (S.I.T.) This program is designed 
as a tiered model of service delivery with interventions provided to all students who demonstrate a need for support, 
regardless of whether or not they have an ELL or disability label. This SIT team includes Bilingual, General Ed and Special Ed. 
educators who monitor data of students that are not reaching their benchmark. Collaborative educational decisions, based on 
ongoing school, classroom, and individual student data is reviewed to make adjustments to instruction based on data.  Out RTI 
teams meet Bi-monthly to discuss these matters. In addition our SETTS, Bilingual staff, and ENL teachers meet with classroom 
teachers, review our school wide curriculum pacing calendar, students assessment data, and their IEP to develop a program 
schedule as well as lesson plans and materials/resources available. This process allows teachers to provide small group and 
individualize instruction at an appropriate level for students’ language and learning needs.  In addition to complying with the 
IEP, students with special needs receive authentic meaningful experiences that will allow the  opportunity to make connections 
between what they know and what they are learning by relating classroom experiences to their own lives.Furthermore, we 
offer the on-line reading program called “Myon" for our ELL students that require additional support in English Proficiency, 
reading, writing, and listening. Both ENL and Special needs teachers carefully review student’s individualized educational plan 
(IEP) to incorporate other strategic approaches that  enhance academics learning, such as, Total Physical Response (TPR) and 
individual student learning styles.  In addition, we utilize the phonemic programs Estrellita in Spanish and Fundations in English 
to assist ELL's gain proficiency in both languages. 
  
  
  
  
  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In addition to the above statement,  our Bilingual Special  Education Teacher and ENL teachers co-teach ENL along with our 
new  CUNY/NYSIEB initiatives utilizing our school ELL/ENL methodologies.  It is the belief at ours school that ELL-SWDs attains 
English proficiency best within a least restrictive environment.  Our curriculum map, pacing calendar and lesson plans include 
components which indicate differentiation for this learning group using ESL methodology. The ELL Coordinator and the 
Assistant Principal collaborate with our curriculum team to ensure that ESL methods are outlined.  Our school’s 
Math programs also includes differentiation for this group which teacher’s utilizing in their instruction.  The ELL Coordinator 
and the Assistant Principal have ensured that all teachers have access to these strategies by providing them with quick tips at a 
glance, input during PD, common planning, and data analysis when looking at student work.  The ELL Coordinator collaborates 
regularly with the IEP teacher to review whether ELL-SWDs are meeting their IEP goals. Recommendations are given and 
modifications to their IEP are adjusted as needed.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our school offers RTi school wide on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays for 80 minutes a session. Teachers use Passport 
curricular resources and other supplemental materials to intervene for all students. Students are placed in groups with no 
more than 10 students  and receive intensive reading instruction at their level. Groupings are flexible and allow for students to

move to a different instructional group when the reading data shows they have improved. Instruction during school wide RTI is 
in English. Our ELL students that are new to school are also included in this program but receive a different curricular. The 
focus is working on phonic skills in both English and Spanish, their native language. We also provide simple basic math skills 
with intense math vocabulary in both languages. In regards to our long term proficient ELL students, most are in the top grade 
‘one class’ and are invited to attend our advanced talented and gifted after school program. Our after school programs are 
offered to all students regardless of their academic status. We fit the student to the program and cater to the needs of the 
school based on data analysis.We have lots of resources that are utilized throughout the year for our ELL population. Our 
Bilingual and ENL  teachers use Hampton-Brown’s Avenues program to help address English reading and writing skills. This 
program is designed specifically for the ELL student. It is a comprehensive literacy program which provides interesting and 
motivating stories and non-fiction passages for students while providing practice in the mechanics of the language. Grades k-2 
use Fundations, a Wilson language base program which provide explicit cumulative and multi-sensory instruction.  
 
Individual teachers in upper grades (3-5) provide additional support through a host of other programs utilizing technology such 
as smart-boards, Lab-tops, and computers, enabling them to download programs like Reading A-Z, RATZ kids, and Myon. 
Students needing extra support are provided with opportunities to practice sight words, learn new vocabulary, acquire spelling 
rules that are phonics based, and are given further opportunities for reading and writing while in guided reading groups. The 
teachers use a combination of ENL strategies and the native language to help students learn topics in the content areas. In 
addition to all of the mentioned resources, we also provide every ELL class and ENL small group  instruction with Continental 
Press Empire State,  NYSESLAT workbooks to help to help prepare our ELL students for the New York State English as a second 
language achievement test. For our ELL Enrichment Program we utilize the program, Continental ‘Finish line for ELL’s’ common 
core  proficiency practice that focus on linguistic, writing and reading  skills. Teacher’s incorporate NLA into the program 
depending on the level and need of the student. The intent is to scaffold instructional techniques to allow ELL students to 
acquire proficient English language and maintain or build their native language as well. To continue assisting us in our goals for 
our ELL students we have the ‘Estrellita’ Accelerated Beginning Spanish reading program. Another new learning tool is the use 
of  I-pads. As stated before classroom teachers analyzed data in ELA and Math in their grade level Data Inquiry Teams to 
identify needy areas and plan small group instruction. 
 
Our school’s STI team  members are as follows; the data specialist, coach, bilingual special needs, ESL, and General Education 
teachers. Their sub group focus is on ELL students with IEP’s.  These ELL students with IEP’s are grade K-5 and were chosen for 
inquiry as a result of a data analysis which depicted that this particular group of students declined in their ELA test scores for 
the scholastic school year 2016-2017. The data team is providing these chosen students with individualized instruction that is 
aligned to the common core grade standards. This will be done by drilling down two specific skill sets, vocabulary development 
and critical thinking with informational text. The data used to find this information will be the item analysis chart, biweekly and 
cumulative assessments, Fountas & Pinell. The team members are designing weekly lessons for students according to this 
information and the students learning styles. It is the expectation that students will be able to read complex text with purpose 
and understanding. The instruction and lessons given are then turn-keyed to the staff by setting inter class visit or providing 
staff with written lesson plans. 
  
In addition we have targeted our ELL testing grade students (2-5) and provide them with a new ELL After-School Program. This 
intense program provides our students with small group and individualized support in ELA as well as mathematics and science. 
The classes are developed to allow interdisciplinary instruction as subject matter is not taught in isolation. We include various 
non-fiction genres that focus on Science and Math. 
  
Our ELL students that are new to school are also included in this program but receive a different curricular. The focus is 
working on phonic skills in both English and Spanish, their native language. We also provide simple basic math skills with 
intense math vocabulary in both languages. In regards to our long term proficient ELL students, most are in the top grade ‘one 
class’ and are invited to attend our advanced talented and gifted after school program. Our after school programs are offered 
to all students regardless of their academic status. We fit the student to the program and cater to the needs of the school 
based on data analysis.

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Implementing the DOE's Alternative Pathways to Support ELL's Progress program for the commanding students.  
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None.  
  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We currently have 4 CBO's that offer after school programs in our school; Dreamyards, Boy Scouts, Mission Society, and Jon 
Wayne Arts.  All programs send applications to the parents of all our students (including ELL's) and accept ELL 
students.  Programs are equipped with Bilingual speaking staff to meet the needs of our ELL population.  In addition we have 
targeted our ELL testing grade students (3-5) and provide them with a new ELL After-School Program.  This intense program 
provides our students with small group and individualized support in ELA as well as mathematics and science. The classes are 
developed to allow interdisciplinary instruction as subject matter is not taught in isolation. We include various non-fiction 
genres that focus on science and math.  We also provide test  prep practice on the NYSESLAT so our ELL students get exposed 
to the format previous to take the test in April and May. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We have lots of resources that are utilized throughout the year for our ELL population. Our Bilingual and ENL classroom 
teachers use a customized library collection that is aligned to the monthly units of study to help address English reading and 
writing skills.. Our Literacy curriculum  is based on the scope and sequence in Science and Social Studies and is aligned to the 
common core. The library collection includes books in Spanish and includes interesting and motivating non-fiction titles for ELL 
students while providing practice in the mechanics of the language.  Grades K-2 use Fundations, a Wilson language base 
program which provide explicit cumulative and multi-sensory instruction.  Additionally, we provide instructions in both English 
and Spanish, utilize bilingual word walls, bilingual dictionaries, translated materials, and integrate the use of manipulatives and 
technology.

as a Second Language Achievement Test.  
  
For our ELL Enrichment Program we utilize a new program, Continental ‘Finish line for ELL’s’  proficiency Practice that focus on 
linguistic, writing and reading  skills. Teacher’s incorporate NLA into the program depending on the level and need of the 
student. The intent is to scaffold instructional techniques to allow ELL students to acquire proficient English language and 
maintain or build their native language as well. To assist us in our goals for our ELL students we continue utilizing the ‘Estrellita’ 
Accelerated Beginning Spanish reading program. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 In our Transitional bilingual programs, we are have bilingual texts, representing the native languages spoken in the students’ 
classes (mostly Spanish).  In addition, our ESL students are supported in their native language through the following: 
a) Pairing ELLs with a classroom partner or “buddy” who speaks the same primary language. 
b) Encouraging them to talk in their primary languages, as well as English. 
c)  Providing our classroom and school libraries with bilingual (multi-linguistic) texts that represent the primary languages 
spoken within our classroom and school, to the best of our ability. Library collections aligned to the units of study in Social 
Studies and Science have been purchased also in Spanish for TBE classes. 
4)  Use of technology to provide individualized support in learning the second language. (I.e. Arabic 4th grade student; 
computer carts placed in certain class locations)    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All materials utilized in our school are research based and include NYS common core/ ESL /ELL curricular in all grade levels that 
support our ELL student needs. (Please see above responses for a more detailed description.)  We also invite vendors from 
different companies to bring samples to our school and we invite the ELL teachers to check the books and select the ones that 
target their students' academic needs.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
P.S. 33 does not share a building at this time.     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We currently do not have a program to assist newly enrolled students before the beginning of the school year.   We do 
however have a Summer School Program for students who enrolled throughout the school year in addition to Buddy systems 
and an After-School ELL program.  Moving forward, we are going to include an orientation for newly enrolled ELL students and 
parents in June in which they will learn about the school's culture, environment, and have the opportunity to visit 
classrooms.  Our ELL Supervisor/Coordinator, ELL Coach/LAC, Parent Coordinator and ELL Teachers are and will be involved in 
such activities.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
This year we have scheduled monthly meetings with our ELL staff (both teachers and Para-professionals).  This meeting will 
take place during one of the mandated 80 minute Monday's professional development sessions. Our goal is to utilize data such 
as the EDAT to discuss academic and social concerns that pertain to our ELL population. We are going to follow the cycle of 
inquiry approach to analyze ELL student work in ELA and Math.  Through collaborative discussion, teachers will be able to 
identify the academic gaps of their students in each performance level (1-4),   will suggest various intervention strategies that 
have been proven to help in comparative analysis of student work. As a team, we  will come to a consensus about the 
strategies they want to implement as their next steps in maximizing student achievement. As part of this protocol,  teachers 
implement the strategies selected and bring the outcomes to weekly horizontal (Grade level) meetings and Vertical (Across the 
Grades - ELL Specific) where we participate in a second phase of data analysis. This is too capture student achievements or lack 
thereof. This leads into  further inquiry, deeper learning, additional data, and best practices. 
In order to make professional development sessions more relevant and meaningful, teachers were given the opportunity to 
submit a list of topics they feel they need further development on . The topics are as follows: 
 
a) Differentiating instruction for newcomers versus long-term Ells in all levels 
b) Scaffolding instruction and supporting ELL's with IEP's - best practices based on student classification and needs 
c) Inter grating newcomers and SIFE students with limited to no English knowledge and limited to little or no home 
language knowledge 
d) Supporting ELL's in their writing and development of thoughts 
e) Supporting ELL's and teachers in administering and preparing for the new NYSITELL and NYSESLAT 
f) ELL specific websites and technological programs 
g) Differentiating and scaffolding close reading for ELLs 
 
Due to the large variation of topics and the wealth of human resources we have within the ELL department, we will rely on the 
expertise and years of experience of many of our teachers. For example, Ms. DeMarino who last year attended a workshop on 
Close Reading for ELL’s and has been implementing what she learned in her classroom successfully. She will turn-key to staff 
during an upcoming PD session which will equip/strengthen our staff’s knowledge and understanding in how to implement the 
close reading protocols in their own classrooms.  In addition to human resources within the building, we will also use on-line 
resources (such as webinars) and book studies (such as Learning to Learn in a Second Language) to further educate our staff 
and continue increasing our knowledge and understanding of differentiating instruction for students in different tiered groups. 
 
All educators will continue to benefit from participating in weekly grade level meetings where Monolingual and ELL teachers 
share their differentiated practices as well as methodologies that have proven (based on data) to meet the individual needs of 
students.

As it refers to PD topics that benefit all constituencies including Secretaries, Guidance Counselors, Administrators, etc. we have 
held and are planning workshops on: 
* Bill of Rights of Parents of English Language Learners 
* The Translation & Interpretation Unit and Hotline 
* Communicating Effectively with Parents of English Language Learners 
* Maintaining the CUM Records of an English Language Learner 
* Registering an English Language Learner 
* Proper Identification of Home Language 
* Professional Interactions with Parents of English Language Learners (Respecting their Right to Privacy) 
  
 In supporting ELL's as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards teachers of ELL's continue to receive and 
participate in the following professional development seminars/workshops/book studies: 
* Go Math! 
* I Ready 
* Fisher & Frey Model 
* Differentiating for ELL's 
* Myon 
* Word Study - Fundations & Wilson 
* Tiered Activities 
* Project Based Learning 
* Close Reading 
* Curriculum Pacing/Mapping - Modifying for the English Language Learner 
* Thematic Units of Studies  
* Spotlight on Comprehension 
* Teaching Language: 60/40, 50/50, 40/60…models 
* Multiple Entry Points utilizing the Multiple Intelligences & Learning Styles 
* Engaging Students in Learning 
* Scope & Sequence 
  
It is the goal and expectation of PS 33 that our English Language Learners acquire and perform at the same level as their 
monolingual (English) peers.  It is for this reason that ELL teachers receive professional development that allow their ELL 
students equal access to not only the scope & sequence and the curriculum but also to the Core Curriculum Learning Standards 
via state mandated ELL modifications, differentiated/tiered activities, rigorous lessons, thematic units of study, and the Fisher 
& Frey Model for lesson delivery.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The transition for ELL students from elementary to middle school is complex.  Most students are apprehensive about taking 
this mile stone in their lives.  We support ELL students moving forward, their parents and staff by providing them with the 
tools, resources and guidance through this transition.  Our Guidance Counselor is responsible for inputting of applications on 
line, assisting families with understanding the middle school directory, how to make the best selection for their child, 
preparing for school interviews, preparing for the entry exams, and the building of portfolios when applicable. The 
councillor also collaborates with teachers of ELLs to discuss the particular needs and interest of our their students.  They utilize 
data from assessments, Progress Reports, Report Cards, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores,  state test results, parental input, 
student’s feedback and teacher observation to inform them of each student’s needs and interest.  Through this discourse they 
evaluate the programs that middle schools offer to determine which one best meets the needs and interest of our ELLs.  For 
example, schools like The International School for the Liberal Arts and Middle School 45, Aurora Academy; both offer bilingual

programs which further support ELLs in language acquisition.  The Parent Coordinator and Guidance Counselor use an 
assembly forum to invite fifth grade parents, teachers, and students to attend a comprehensive conversation about the 
moving up requirements and the programs that middle schools offer.  Translation for ELL parents is provided simultaneously 
by the members of our vast Spanish speaking staff.  During this time personnel from the middle schools also present and 
discuss the various programs their schools offer.  We host an open house for parents to introduce them to staff members of 
middle schools for a questions and answers period and literature distribution.  After consultation with teachers, students, 
parents, parent coordinator and participation in all the resources mentioned the Guidance Counselor assists students with the 
timely completion and submission of middle school application forms.  Parents are informed of the dates for the upcoming 
events through fliers ( which are translated in to their language preferences) and our monthly calendar of events, which the 
Parent Coordinator alongside the Guidance Counselor create and  then distribute to students. We also ensure fliers and 
calendars are posted throughout the school building to increase flow of information.   To meet the professional development 
requirements as per CR Part 154.2,  PS 33 has planned a minimum of 15% total hours of professional development for all 
teachers as follows: One Monday a month (after-school for approximately 80 minutes) beginning in November,  the ELL 
Supervisor, ELL Coach, or Qualified Designee will facilitate PD sessions that are ELL specific.  Agendas, Minutes, sample work, 
teacher feedback, and attendance sign-in sheets (as applicable) will be kept in a binder in the ELL Coach's  
Office as well as in a Binder in the Principal's Office which will be labeled accordingly.  As it refers to bilingual 
education/ENL teachers, PS 33 has planned a minimum of 50% total hours of professional development as follows:  One of 
Four Horizontal/GradeLevel Meetings a month will be focused on an ELL specific topic.  Agendas, minutes, sample work, 
teacher feedback, and attendance sign-In sheets (each as applicable) will be kept in a binder in the ELL Coach's Office as well as 
in a binder in the Principal's Office.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
ENL teachers send invitations with their students home in English and in the child's home language to schedule an 
appointment with parents to discuss the goals of the ENL program and the child's linguistic strengths and needs. These 
meetings are held on Tuesdays during Parent Engagement.  The child's classroom teacher along with the ENL teacher co-
facilitate the meeting in order to give a complete view of the child's academic and linguistic needs and use NYSESLAT/ NYSITELL 
and other assessment data to guide the conversation between the parents the teachers. The parents are also provided with 
data reports of the child's progress and information on the rights of English Language Learners and their parents along with 
practical ways in which parents can help their children at home. . Going forward parents who are unable to attend on Tuesdays 
will be scheduled for over the phone meetings using Over the Phone Interpretation when necessary.  Teachers in the TBE 
program similarly schedule meetings with parents on Tuesdays during Parent Engagement and review the student's  language 
and academic needs.The parents are given information on how to support their child academically and linguistically at home 
along with progress/ data reports.  
 
To strengthen home and school connections with child, parent, and other staff during school we recognize and celebrate 
various holidays and events such as; Grandparents Day, Family Pictures with Santa,  A Festival of International Cultures , and 
Mothers Day Presentation, to name a few.  Our monthly calendar informs parents of all upcoming events and fliers are 
distributed in Spanish and English by our parent coordinator (are available in other languages upon request).   
  
We provide professional development opportunities for staff with the assistance of parents to improve outreach, 
communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other members of the 
school community; our SLT parents are engaged in the teacher effectiveness protocol planning initiative to gain an 
understanding on how we can improve our practices, curriculum, and meeting the needs of their children.  Note: that the SLT 
includes a parent representative for ELLs and SWD.    
 Our parent coordinator is involved in our entire parent out-reach initiative.  She works closely with our bilingual supervisor, 
ELL coach, parents and program facilitators, to ensure that parent needs are met.  She reviews and keeps a record of parent

attendance during their visits.    
  
Parents continue to engage in learning activities beyond the classroom setting. We continue to foster parent’s knowledge 
acquisition by exposing parents and their children to social/cultural events and trips throughout New York City such as: 
Fordham Library, museums, parks and colleges.  During these field trips parents and their children attend workshops that help 
them to solidify their understanding of the common core content knowledge.  We include interactive read aloud, strategies for 
reading before, during and after; ELA/Math games to foster their learning of words/vocabulary.  Through these collaborative 
efforts parents gain proficiency in making connection and linking the CCLS beyond the classroom/school.  The ENL facilitators 
attend these trips and conduct these workshops and provide translation for all involved parents.   
  
In addition parents participate in a in cultural literacy projects through a CBO, “LINC” program which is design to train parents 
a volunteers and teach how to develop early literacy skills in their children. 
  
Action Plan for Grades 3, 4 and 5: Parent of ELL-SWD in grades 3, 4, and 5 in self-contained setting participate in progress 
monitoring meetings.  Parents with children in these grades are invited to attend orientation/ 
informational meetings with the IEP teacher and ELL coordinator, which is available for translation to discuss related issues, 
that includes the progress of their child as outlined in the IEP.  During this time, parents are informed and invited to attend the 
common core Saturday initiative which further empowers them to meet the academic needs of their child.  In addition, 
monthly workshops for parents will be scheduled to enable them to help their children at home. Our Parent Coordinator is 
available to parents who need information regarding their child’s education. She keeps the parents informed about the 
services their children are entitled to. Letters are sent to parents on a regular basis to provide parents with important 
information to scheduled meetings. Parents needs are evaluated by reviewing parent surveys, during parent-teachers 
conference and other forms of inquiry.  The Parent coordinator participates in various school/Community based organizations 
such as; The Boy Scouts, Dreamyards, and Mission Society. 
 
We also provide Saturday ESL classes for parents of our ELL community and include childcare services to ensure good 
attendance. We believe by enhancing parent linguistic skill in the English language it will have a positive impact on our 
student’s academic performance. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Ms. Carmen Farina, set aside 40 minutes every Tuesday for Parent Engagement meetings/activities with teachers. Whenever 
teachers need to schedule a meeting with the child’s parent, they send an invitation  translated into their preferred languages. 
Teachers meet parents in their rooms and discuss the academic/social matter affecting the student’s performance. In addition 
to that, our parent coordinator sends out our student calendar each month to inform parents about cultural or instructional 
activities that are organized to keep parents involved their children’s education such as Grandparent’s Day, Picture Day with 
Santa and an ESL program for adults on Saturdays from 9am to 1 pm. Parents are also invited to student performances, in their 
classrooms or in the auditorium, monthly to show case their unit of study or leanings on that months holiday. The purpose of 
this is to assure that parents support their children and are role models for success. Method of notification is the same as 
noted above.    
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Finally – How do we know if our program is meeting the needs of Second Language Learners? We have given special academic 
support to ELL's students and have found the following:    
Our school holds high expectations for the learning and personal development of our ELLS 
•     The curriculum will continue to be integrated across disciplines and real life applications will continue to be related to student 
experiences. 
*    We are committed to ensuring that our ELL's acquire and perform at the same level as their monolingual peers through 
differentiated, tiered activities, scaffolded assignments, and Project based learning that allows students access to the learning 
through multiple entry points, differentiated for their learning style, multiple intelligence, and the Fisher and Frey Model .

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Lynette Santos, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

To assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and oral communication, we have 
several systems/practices in place. To begin, we ask that all parents/guardians register in person . When coming in 
to register their child, parents/guardians are greeted by bilingual (Spanish/English) personnel who informally 
determine the preferred language of the parent/guardian through simple questioning within a conversation. If the 
parent's preferred language of communication is English or Spanish, the individuals (Pupil Accounting 
Secretary/Family Worker) registering the child proceed to register the child accordingly and note parent's 
language preference on all paperwork (as indicated below) and on ATS as required. If it is determined that a

parent has a language other than English or Spanish, Pupil Accounting reaches out to the Language Access 
Coordinator (LAO) who then proceeds with the registration process by either reaching out to staff members who 
are point contact for the specific language, call the Department of Education Translation & Interpretation Hotline, 
and/or supply the parents with resources and materials in their preferred language of communication. Within the 
registration process (in the parent's/guardian's preferred language), parents complete the HLIS, Student 
Emergency Contact Cards, and the NYC Department of Education Language Preference Form (which render the 
parent/guardian the opportunity to communicate/select the language they prefer for oral and written 
communication) with the help of the LAC.Note: To help ensure that all staff are aware and communication with 
parents/guardians in their language of preference, Language Access Coordinator periodically prints a RAPL report 
which identifies the preferred language of every parent as indicated on the HLIS, student blue card, and/or the 
NYC Language Preference Sheet. Data gathered from this report helps us keep teachers (and other staff as 
applicable) informed of parents' language preference. This regularly updated information helps teachers plan for 
translation and interpretation services (utilizing the Over The Phone Language Line) to effectively,positively, and 
productively communicate with parents.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.  
 

Document Name  

Month/Frequency Distributed to 

Families  

The following documents are typically 
disseminated annually in English and 
Spanish: 

*Newsletters/ 

Student Calendars 

*Few days before the beginning of each 
month 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

How do you plan to translate? Include 
procedures to ensure timely provision 
of translated documents to parents.  

Many of our school staff members 
(Secretaries and Administrators) speak 
Spanish and English , which are the 
preferred languages for the majority of 
our parents. (Based on the RAPL 
Report) Any written document is, first, 
generated in English by the Parent 
Coordinator, the Parent Association 
President, or one of the 
administrators. Secondly, the school 
secretary proof-reads the document 
and return it to the Parent Coordinator 
who, then, uses the Google translation 
feature or the Intranet pre-generated 
target language forms to translate it 
into Spanish. The final draft is, then, 
reviewed by the Assistant Principal in 
charge of ELL's for its dissemination to 
our school community and accuracy of 
target language. 

 

Note: Upon parent/guardian request, 
above documents are translated in 
parents preferred language with the 
assistance of either an on-site 
translator such as ' Over-The-Phone 
Interpreter Services Desk Aid' or with 
the assistance of an approved vendor. 
The flyer from the 'Over-The-Phone 
Interpreter Services: Desk Aid' is 
posted on the main office, the ELL/LAC 
coordinator office and the Parent 
Coordinator's office so the pertinent 
staff could get access to language line 
interpretation services as needed. 

P.S. 33X pedagogical and support staff 
also receive a copy of this flyer at the 
beginning of the academic year to 
have access to these translation 
services when they meet with LEP

interpretation service(s)?  

Our school has many bilingual staff 
who is willing and able to provide 
translation in the preferred language 
of the parent. We also identified other 
staff members who can communicate 
in various other languages as 
identified through the staff survey 
(French, Creole, Mandarin, American 
Sign Language) who are also available 
during those face-to-face meetings to 
translate throughout the school year. 
For any other language such as 
Chinese, Arabic, and other incidental 
languages we'll contact a DOE Vendor 
for on-site interpreters or use the 
Over The Phone Language Line 
interpreters where appropriate. This 
will allow staff to access 200 plus 
languages so they can speak to all 
parents and guardians. The LAC will

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In case of emergency, the LAC and/or Parent Coordinator will request the assistance of either an on-site translator or 
the assistance from The Translation and Interpretation Unit. LAC also provides each teacher a list of their students 
names, parents preferred language and contact numbers, which includes a header, and a flyer from the Over The 
Phone Interpretation Services from the Bronx Field Support Center that includes directions and needed phone access 
numbers. This will allow staff to access 200 plus languages so they can speak to all parents. Especially if you end up in 
an emergency evacuation. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During the Chancellor's Conference Day at the beginning of the year, the LAC and Assistant Principal in charge of ELL's 
will review and provide hard copies of the Chancellor's Regulation A-663 to the staff and make sure that they sign off 
once they receive it. We'll also post this regulation on Google docs within the school account. The LAC will organize a 
professional development session exclusively on translations and interpretation services during the mandated 
Monday's 80 min. P.D. for the staff.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

PS 33X: 

*Provides each parent whose primary language is a NYC DOE covered language and who require language assistance 
services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities in their preferred language 

*Ensures that a sign indicating the availability of interpretation services is posted in the main lobby provided by the 
BFSC and Translation & Interpretation Unit (they are printed in many languages).

*Additional signs posted around the school (main office, nurses office, restrooms, etc.) that are in multiple languages. 
Provided by the Translation & Interpretation Unit and local staff 

*Staff will utilize the Translation & Interpretation Unit resources (over the phone, pre-generated hand outs, and 
translation of documents from approved DOE vendors) to effectively communicate with parents and guardians. This 
will allow staff to access 200 plus languages so they can speak to all parents. 

*Will ensure that school's safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access 
services are not prevented from reaching the school's administrative offices solely due to language barriers. 

*Will obtain documents and information in each of the covered languages concerning the rights of parents to 
translation and interpretation services and how to access such services from the Department's website via the DOE 
Translation and Interpretation Unit's Intranet site: 

http://intranet.nycboe.net/SchoolSupport/translation_and_interpretation_ unit.  

*For the parents of languages not spoken by our school personnel and or not covered by the DOE translated 
materials, we'll contact a DOE Vendor for on-site interpreters or use the 1800-Language Line over-the-phone 
interpreters where appropriate. This will allow staff to access 200 plus languages so they can speak to all parents 
regardless of preferred language. The LAC will be facilitating the provision of those services to parents as needed. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

PS 33X will gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services via a parent survey, face to face 
conversations, and/or a focus group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school. This 
will happen periodically pursuant of the meetings indicated on Part B, Question 2.
