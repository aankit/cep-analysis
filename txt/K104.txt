Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S./I.S. 104 is a K-8 school that provides students with a well-rounded education in a nurturing and supportive 
environment. Due to our conviction to educate the whole child, we will stress a theme focusing on Leadership and 
Civic Responsibility. To this end, students will participate in social initiatives and altruistic and charitable endeavors. 
Our concern for the welfare of our students is evident through our school slogan, "We are family." 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

There are several pieces of critical information important to understanding the P.S./I.S. 104 school community.  

First, we are a Campus School who shares our building with P53, a District 75 program. Within the framework of 
collaborating with this school, we have implemented an Inclusion Program offering 5 students in grades 2 – 6 from 
District 75 an opportunity to be included in our general education classrooms. Additionally, we have been fortunate 
to provide Integration to several more severely handicapped students in multiple aspects of our school community. 

Approximately 13% of our students come from the Fort Hamilton Army Base. This population is transient in nature 
with significant changes each year. These students have experienced great difficulty in keeping up academically as the 
Common Core Curriculum is not followed in Embassy Schools throughout the world. Additionally, these students 
experience separation anxiety due to the constant deployment of one or, in many cases, both parents. 

 

Although we are a Kindergarten through Grade 8 school, each year 1/3 of our grade 6 student population transfers 
from other schools in and out of district.  

We are not a Title I school which seriously affects our overall budget. This lack of funding does not enable us to fund 
critical positions for a school of our size, such as Coach or Lead Teacher. This impacts on our ability to provide 
professional development from outside sources and funding for our teachers to attend outside professional 
development. We are unable to offer supplemental programs or expand our arts programs. Additionally, we must 
utilize Military Life Counselors and NYU Counselors provided through the Fort Hamilton Army Base, due to a lack of 
funding for an additional Guidance Counselor position.  

Lastly, we work hard to maintain a cohesive environment despite the fact we are located in two separate buildings. 
Our Kindergarten and 1 st Grade are housed in an Annex on 89 th Street. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

14% of our students are Students with Disabilities. The needs of these students range from mild disabilities in terms of 
speech and language to more severe disabilities such as ambulatory, ID and emotional needs. 

An additional student population we are addressing is our English Language Learners. 9% of our student population is 
comprised of English Language Learners. What makes our ELLs unique is the varied home languages our school 
services. We have 11 primary languages which does not allow numbers of contiguous students to allow for bi-lingual 
or TBE/Dual Language programs. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which we made the most progress over the past year are as 
follows: 

Rigorous Instruction: 

After reviewing the School Performance Dashboard, we determined that 57% of our students were at Level 3 or 4 in 
ELA as measured by the NYS Exam. We will identify students at level 1 and up to a minimum proficiency of 3 on the 
NYS ELA exam. Additionally, we will identify students in grades K-3 through Fountas and Pinnell, Orton Gillingham and 
Scantron Baseline Assessments. These students will be targeted for small group instruction and explicit teaching 
strategies in order to move them to Level 3 or 4. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

After reviewing the School Performance Dashboard, we determined that 54% of our students were at Level 3 or 4 in 
Math as measured by the NYS Math Exam. We will identify students in grades 3-8 at the 75 th Growth Percentile or 
higher. We will further identify ELL students in grades 3-8 between the 24 – 74 percentile range. All ELL students will 
be targeted for support through a restructured ENL program focused primarily on a push-in model. Teachers will 
collaborate to plan lessons to meet the needs of the ELL students.  

 

Collaborative Teachers: 

In the 2017 – 2018 school year, all teachers worked on an inquiry focus around Ells and students with disabilities. 
Teachers engaged in work around developing a common lens for instruction engaging students with the four 
modalities for learning and vocabulary instruction. This work led the teams and administration to develop 
Professional Learning communities that include differentiated professional development to meet the different needs 
of the staff. 

The administration helped to identify strengths within the teaching staff enabling us to develop a mode of teacher-led 
professional development. 

 

Social and Emotional Learning:  

After reviewing the results of the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey, to note areas of positive responses as 
compared with the percentage of positive responses citywide, we noted only 62% of students say their teachers 
support them when they are upset. This noticing will lead to stronger professional development among the staff.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
While our teachers are overall Effective based on a review of the Advance Overall Summary Report, we would like to 
continue to enhance our work in small group instruction with a particular focus on student sub-groups such as: ELLs. 
We have demonstrated growth as measured by an increase in data of Language Acquisition for many of our ENL 
groups. However, through review of MOTP data, we have determined a need for a better understanding of 
assessment through small group instruction and multiple opportunities to demonstrate understanding prior to 
moving to independent work time. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of teachers of Ells will raise the level of assessment of student acquisition and usage of academic 
vocabulary in speaking and writing as measured by vertical and horizontal work around assessing the vocabulary 
instruction developed through our inquiry work. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on discussions at the June 2018 Summative MOTP Conferences and review of Professional Development 
Reflection sheets and Professional Learning Community Reflection Sheets and Surveys, we determined a need to 
continue targeted professional development and strengthen teacher teams in differentiating their own professional 
development. 

Teacher teams have been an active part in professional development and the follow-up of initiatives related to school 
goals. 

Certain teams have developed expertise in some areas while others need continued support. Therefore, we would like 
to continue Teacher Teams who will create a menu of professional development items based on supporting Ells, swds 
and advanced students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teacher teams will engage Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) that will result in 100% of the 
teachers engaged in collaborative professional development work around designing and implementing Common Core 
Learning Standards aligned, project-based learning opportunities with scaffolds and supports for all students including 
Ells, Swds and advanced students as measured by PLC Reflection Sheets.

plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. [School name], in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[School name] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g.,ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

be selected based on the need to provide exposure to the format and construct of the 
NYSESLAT.  Additionally, teachers will provide academic vocabulary support for students at all 
levels.  Entering students will also supply Orton Gillingham instruction in the after-school 
program.  These students have made progress according to the NYSESLAT, however, we would 
like to see greater gains in the reading and writing bands.  All Ell students eligible to take the 
NYSESLAT will be invited to the program. To achieve this, we are purchasing, researched based 
programs, for students in grades 3 - 8. These programs will include Finish Line New York 
Ells.  The language of instruction for the program will be English.  The program will align ENL 
methodologies while addressing grade band NYSESLAT content. The certified teachers will 
include one licensed ENL teacher and 5 content area teachers for an after-school program 
running one day per week (Wednesdays) for two hours per day (2:30PM-4:30PM) for 14-15 
weeks (Nov 28- April 17).  Students will engage in working through rigorous NYSESLAT tasks 
and activities that build fluency in the major content emphasis strands.  Parents will be notified 
of the programs through translated letters in the languages needed.  Attendance records will be 
maintained by the teachers and the supervisor.  When a student is absent from the program, 
parents will be called utilizing the Translation Unit when needed.  Lastly, we will provide 
professional development to meet with teachers to develop strategies to better serve the ENL 
students particularly those ENL students with disabilities.

Begin description here:            
  
The school staff, including the administration, the ENL teachers, classroom and specialty 
teachers, the parent coordinator and the support staff, work diligently to provide a welcoming 
atmosphere for the students, their parents and the community.  All school related information is 
distributed to parents of ELLs in English or in the native language when available.  Our parent 
coordinator provides assistance to newcomers, ELL students and their families.  Our school 
maintains a list of volunteer translators to assist in communication with non-English speaking 
parents.  At the beginning of each year, the parent coordinator distributes a survey to all parents 
asking for their language of choice in receiving information.  This survey is used to provide 
parents with information in their native language when available.  The administration also 
receives the results of the Learning Environment Surveys completed by parents, enabling us to 
be aware of their concerns and needs.  In addition to previously mentioned parental support, 
parents of ELLs are invited to 4 parent teacher conferences in September, November, March and 
May.  PS/IS 104 is aware of the supportive role parents play in the daily education of all 
students.  A continual outreach is made to the parents of ELL students.  Their lack of ability with 
the English language sometimes makes them reluctant to participate.  On-going parent 
workshops  conducted by Licensed ENL teachers, translations of most materials, use of 
translation services and family oriented activities throughout the school year, work to inform and 
involve these as well as mainstream parents.  Parents will be notified of these parent workshops 
in the needed languages through translated letters.  Agendas and sign in sheets will be used to 
keep record of parent workshops.  PTA meetings are held monthly at varying times to include all

parents in school activities.  In addition to the ENL Orientation, Open School Week and Parent 
Teacher Conferences, parents are invited to the school for various events such as: Grandparents 
Day, multicultural celebrations, assembly programs, student performances, Book Fair, classroom 
presentations and trips.  Prior to the school year, we offer families the opportunity to tour the 
school if requested.  In addition, we have a website through E-Chalk to assist all parents in 
becoming involved in their child's education and Pupilpath to inform the parents of their child's 
progress.  The website has been extremely helpful in parent involvement for our ELL families as 
it allows them to translate information by simply pushing a button. In an effort to meet the 
identified needs of our school, we have implemented the School Messenger System translated 
into our priority languages. Lastly, teachers will conduct parent outreach every Tuesday to 
support student programs including ELL students.  In addition to the ENL Orientation 
Workshop, the ENL teachers will be presenting additional workshops. 
January 2019 -  administration will provide parents with a workshop regarding the State ELA 
and Math exams their children will be taking. 
February 2019 - the ENL teachers will provide parents with a blueprint of the state NYSESLAT 
exam their children will be taking. 
March 2019- parents will be invited to a workshop presented by ENL teachers offering ways to 
assist their children at home. 
 
Additionally, parents will be invited to two workshops in the Fall and Spring presented by 
official teachers regarding literacy and math initiatives.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
      To assess early literacy skills of English Language Learners (ELLs), the school uses the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark 
Assessment System in Grades Kindergarten, 1  st   and second grade, Scantron Performance Series in grdaes 3-8,  and Orton 
Gillingham Assessments in grades Kindergarten to 5th grade.  All English Language Learners in grades Kindergarten through 
8th Grade use Imagine Learning which has built in assessments (Pre-Tests, Interim Tests, and End of Program Tests) for reading 
comprehension, fluency, and skills analysis. We also use teacher-created literacy assessments (i.e. rubrics to assess writing, 
reading, and task-based rubrics). Examining the data for these students, Fountas and Pinnell tells us if our English Language 
Learners are reading below, at, or above grade level.  In the lower grades Fountas and Pinnell also tells us about students’ 
phonemic awareness.  Imagine Learning assessments tell us their progress as they use the program, how they’re doing on each 
of the lessons, and the item analysis tells us if they need to revisit any of the skills within the Imagine Learning targeted skills. It 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

also monitors the pacing of their progress and  which specific lessons individual students need repeated exposure with in order 
to work towards mastery.  In grades K-2 every student gets assessed through Orton, which allows teachers to target early 
literacy skills such as phonemic awareness and fluency, decoding and encoding. In the older grades, we also use the Advanced 
Orton Gillingham assessments in order to create targeted instructional groups to work with Greek and Latin Roots and Suffixes 
and more advanced vocabulary development. ENL and classroom teachers use this assessment data to inform our school’s 
instructional plan in that teachers use data about students’ reading levels to select and adapt texts, to provide scaffolding for 
students in push-in classrooms, to form groups, to drive instruction, and to decide what next steps to pursue with students. 
Teachers use the writing rubrics to determine next instructional steps and work with students to teach students to self-assess 
and set goals for their writing using the rubrics.  Teacher with Ell students that are also Special Education Children do not use 
Fountas and Pinnell, but Achieve 3000 for ELA instruction and Assessment for our ELL students.  All of the above data helps us 
determine Ell needs.  We have discovered that our Ells struggle with reading comprehension and being able to answer 
questions while citing evidence.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

In order to support this effort, we have trained our Early Childhood Teachers and our ENL Teachers in Orton Gillingham and 
Fountas and Pinnell.  In addition our grade 3-8 teachers have been trained in Scantron and Advanced Orton Gillingham.  This 
yearly training includes analyzing data to inform targeted instructional decisions, how to utilize the supports offered within 
each program, how to assist parents in working with their children and the implications for classroom instruction and 
interventions.  Additionally, we provide quarterly training for teachers utilizing Achieve 3000 including demo lessons and 
debriefing.  ENL teachers meet with administration to review data in order to effectively plan for their students and articulate 
with teachers weekly.  A professional Learning Community was also created to support teachers in this work.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of the program and how progress is measured based on the data resulting from the NYSESLAT, the 
State Exams, the gains in proficiency and growth percentile of the students. In addition, we measure the success of our 
program by the review of parent surveys requesting the same mode of instruction through Freestanding ENL year after 
year.  Teachers have been trained in ENL strategies in order to provide the same level of support for the student when the 
student is in the regular day program. For example, classroom teachers support students’ new language development by 
providing translation through translating programs, using visual supports for instructional, etc.  Additionally, we review Orton 
Gillingham initial assessments, CCLS tasks, gains in Scantron or Achieve 3000 lexile.  We have identified the area of need to be 
strengthening the students' understanding of the format of the NYSESLAT exam.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We utilize the data gathered to review and provide RTI interventions as needed.  For example, students that require the Orton 
Gillignham program will get the support from the ENL teacher.  The data also allows us to determine small group instruction to 
provide targeted support in the classroom.   
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 We have worked with all staff to ensure strong professional development with the expectation that teachers will provide solid 
instruction within the regular day program, while planning for the varied learning styles of their students, the language needs 
and levels of the ELLs and providing differentiated instruction to the students with an ENL approach. Students are provided the 
mandated level of support according to the data provided from the NYSESLAT and the NTSITELL. We then review data to 
determine if students are receiving the appropriate support services. When needed, we provide more targeted intervention. 
For example, students that continue to struggle with langauge acquisition after initial screening are provided with additional 
support through the Title III after-school program, after-school homework help and small group instruction in the classroom. 
When there is a need for an additional level of support, students may be provided with the Orton-Gillingham Approach to 
teaching langauge or small group AIS.  This may be done in a small group where students are grouped based on level rather 
than grade. Lastly, a student might receive one-to one assistance to accommodate their learning needs. We use the number of 
years in ENL, Home Language Literacy, SIFE status, Long-Term ELL status, Teacher recommendations, Parent requests, sample 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

student work, the social and emotional needs of the student and Educational evaluation information to make RTI 
determinations. 
    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Based on the 2016, NYSESLAT results, 34% of ELLs in K and 1 were commanding, 36% of students in  
grades 2-4, 38% in grades 5-6 and 18% in grades 7-8. We also noted that in many cases our ELLs became commanding in the 
speaking and listening portions of the NYSESLAT in a shorter period of time. The 2016 NYSESLAT exam showed 79% of all our 
ELLs reached proficiency in Listening and Speaking. This information led us to see the need for differentiated work in order to 
meet their individual needs.  As a result, we have included planning for small group instruction with an emphasis on ELLs and 
SWDs a goal in our CEP.   In addition, we have supplemented the regular literacy instruction with the Imagine Learning 
program.  This program  allows the students to begin with an assessment that puts them on their individual level for ELA 
including sight words, Phonemic awareness, comprehension and written work.  The students then work at their own pace 
when they log on and the students are also able to work on the program at home.   Teachers have been working toward this 
goal of stronger small group instruction in their collaborative planning with the ENL push-in teachers, and through planning of 
scaffolds and UDL modifications to support the ELL students.  The school has made differentiation and higher order 
questioning skills a goal in order to address the needs of our subgroups. 
    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We have created a Professional Learning Community that meets monthly to disseminate these findings, delve deeper into the 
New Language Progressions and use this information to revise curriculum maps and plan for instruction.   Additionally, 
articulation periods have been built into the regular school time in order to provide time for ENL teachers to articulate this 
information to classroom teachers and work collaboratively to plan for instruction.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

As per CR Part 154, we offer ENL through an Integrated model.  At the entering, emerging and transitioning levels, 
integrated ENL with ELA is provided.  At the expanding level, integrated ENL is provided through the core content 
Area.  In grades K-6, ELL students are heterogeneously mixed within classrooms and stay together with their class. The 
ENL teacher pushes-in to the classroom with th Common Branch teacher.  In grades 7 and 8 the students are also 
heterogeneously mixed in different classes and the ENL teacher pushes-in to a subject area appropriate to their 
needs.  We have one teacher who is licensed in math and ENL.  She provides the ENL service during math to certain 
grade 7 and 8 classes.

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

ELL students’ placement is reflective of the required screening and the Parent Survey Selection Forms. When parents choose 
English as a New Language as their vehicle of service, we utilize the results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to determine their 
proficiency levels. ENL teachers push-in 6 periods one day per week and 5 periods four days per week with one period of pull-
out four days a week for mixed grade entering students.  This service is provided by Three full-time ENL teachers, a 3 day per 
week F-status teacher and a one day per week F-status teacher.  Program cards are reviewed along with entitlement lists by 
the Assistant Principal and with each new admit.   Program cards and provider lists are reviewed by the AP in charge of ELLs 
and when students are admitted, we review available classes to place students in a class that will allow the appropriate 
program according to parent selection.      
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The ESL teachers utilize a variety and combination of Balanced Literacy and English as a New Language strategies and 
techniques, using the workshop model, when possible. These include word study, phonics, guided reading, direct instruction in 
reading and writing, in the content areas. ESL classroom activities are reflective of the content area topics which are in the 
Core Curriculum of each grade. The ESL teachers realize that content related language/academic language takes a long time to 
develop. Therefore, the ESL teachers work to modify content area materials to make the material comprehensible to the ELL 
student.  All ELL students receive testing accommodations including extended time and a third reading of any listening passage 
for all assessments. In addition, each of these students has a license to utilize the Imagine Learning Program. All ELL students 
are 
invited to participate in the Title III After-School Program. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

All ELL students are assessed with material in the Native Language where available. Students are given the Math Baseline 
Assessments, the NYC Performance Assessments, the NY State exams in content area subjects in the Native Language when 
available. Where Alternate language editions of exams were not available, students were given translators for State exams in 
math for low incidence languages.  The school will also utilize screeners if needed to ensure that ELLs are appropriately 
evaluated in their home languages throughout the year.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Our 2 SIFE students receive targeted instruction through the Imagine Learning Program. This program provides individualized 
instruction in letter recognition, sight words, vocabulary, phonemic awareness, phonics, reading comprehension and grammar. 
In addition, these students are provided small group instruction within the regular day program to address the students’ needs 
according to the results of the Imagine Learning assessments and classroom observations. 
Our 108 Ells in U.S. schools for less than three years receive ENL instruction in the day program. In addition, they are offered a 
Title III after-school program where licensed ENL teachers provide one to one and small group instruction. The program aims 
at strengthening areas of weakness as identified through the NYSESLAT, Imagine Learning and classroom assessments in the 
Common Core. This group also includes our SIFE student. 
Our 15 ELLs receiving service for 4-6 years, receive ENL instruction as prescribed by their level according to the NYSESLAT exam 
and daily Imagine Learning support. All teachers have been trained in the format of the NYSESLAT exam in order to align 
curriculum with the skills necessary for the NYSESLAT exam. In addition, ENL teachers utilize common planning time with the 
classroom teachers weekly by grade. These plans reflect the content area topics being covered in the regular classroom 
enabling the ENL teachers to provide a seamless approach to the ELL students. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

Our 8 long-term ELLs have received the above mentioned services including Imagine Learning. Additionally, these students 
have been grouped for after-school. During this time they receive support from a licensed Reading Specialist who provides ELA 
and Math instruction with an ENL approach. 
Our 8 ELLs identified as having special needs are offered accommodations on all assessments as per their IEPs. During after-
school,  these students are supported by a licensed Resource Room teacher or a licensed Reading Specialist who provide ELA 
and math instruction with an ESL approach. These students have also received instruction in the Orton-Gillingham, and 
Achieve 3000 programs. 
Lastly, Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status will continue to receive two periods of ENL service in a push-in 
model.  They will also receive testing accommodations for two years after exiting ELL status and AIS support where needed. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs are provided time to articulate with service providers to provide seamless support for the 
students.  Students are given access to Imagine Learning.  It is an online approach to teaching reading according to the 
individual students' needs.  Students take an initial assessment to determine their literacy level.  Each time the student log on, 
they will work through appropriate activities including letter and sound work, phonemic awareness, and comprehesnion.  In 
addition, we have implemented the Orton Gillingham Multi-Sensory Approach to Reading with our ELL-SWDs.  This program 
provides students with materials that allow the students to learn letters and sounds through sand, colored pencils, tapping and 
word boxes.   Native Language Glossaries and books are provided when it is determined that the students are literate in their 
native language.  All above websites are translated into some languages to provide the students with materials in the Native 
Language as additional support.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 ELL-SWDs have been provided flexible scheduling where many receive Special Education services within an ICT program. 
Additionally, some ELL-SWDs are in a general education setting and given multiple SETSS periods to address their learning 
needs and support them in the movement from 12:1 to a Less Restrictive Environment. When an ELL is identified as a long-
term student struggling to acquire the English Language, we provide at-risk services where available to provide support before 
a referral is requested. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Teachers use small-group instruction to provide intervention to ELLs. Imagine Learning is utilized at key times during the 
regular school day to provide individualized instruction at the students' appropriate level in ELA. In addition, within the regular 
classroom program, ELLs are provided with Native Language glossaries and teachers target specific skills and strategies using 
an ENL approach. In all subject areas, ENL students are provided with the necessary time extension for assessment. 
Manipulatives are used in math to demonstrate concepts being taught. Newcomers are invited to join the Title III after-school 
program where the 
teachers serve no more than 10 students. Additionally, all ELL students are offered the after-school program, 
where they are given instruction in ELA and math. This program is offered to ELLs at all levels of 
English. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

 Our ENL teachers are taking part in monthly Chats with the Principal where they gain information and suggestions on 
implementing the Common Core State Standards, differentiating for students with special needs and tackling instruction in 
consideration of the language progressions. We have also reorganized our after-school program to include a 50 minute per 
week period where ESL teachers are taking part in Sharing Best Practices, Analyzing Student work, ENL Standards and 
Language Progressions and developing Teacher knowledge around Danielson's Framework for Teaching in order to improve 
Teacher Pedagogy. We implement a math program in grades K-5.  The enVision Math Program provides for many supports for 
our students. The online component allows parents to view lessons at home in order to assist their children. The program also 
can be translated into three languages to provide access to families where English may not be their first language. In order to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

assist our parents in understanding the new program, we have begun Parent workshops where parents are invited into the 
school to learn about the program, what their child is currently studying and what can be done at home to help. Parents will 
also be invited to the classrooms on Tuesdays during Parent Engagement time and during various activities.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 All after school and supplemental services are open to all students based on need as identified through ELA, Math 
and NYSESLAT exams. We invite all ELL students to participate in the after-school Program. Enrichment Programs offered at 
the school were on a first come, first serve basis for all students.  Additionally, we continue to utilize and develop our school 
website through E-Chalk which provides information to parents about the school, programs offered, classroom pages for 
homework, and communication with the teacher. This website and the information contained on it can be accessed by all 
parents of the P.S./I.S. 104 community and can be translated into our primary languages through the push of a button. This 
allows parents to become partners in their child's education regardless of language. Additionally, we have invested in the 
School Messenger System where families receive an automated phone call translated into various languages informing parents 
of pertinent school information, dates, absences and initiatives.  After school we offer ELLs a math program to reinforce ELA 
skills in preparationf or the NYSELSAT. Additionally, we offer a Junior High OST program that ELL students have access to.  They 
are also offered CHAMPS.   Regents math and Science is offered to EL students that qualify as do all grade 8 students.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
We have installed Smart Boards in every classroom including the ENL rooms  in order to provide interest and engagement for 
all learners. We have purchased IPads for students to use in their classrooms to access a variety of learning apps and tailor the 
instruction to their needs. The iPads are also used for Imagine Learning, enVisions and several STE programs.  We have 
purchased Hot Dots, an interactive tool to help students develop academic vocabulary and math skills independently. We have 
purchased Myon in order to provide books on each student's particular reading level that can be accessed via the internet in 
school and at home.  Every classroom has multiple desktop computers that are used regularly for research, online support and 
small group instruction.  Classes utilize laptop carts so students have access to laptops on a regular basis.  Technology 
instruction is provided in the computer lab consisting of new Mac Desktop computers.  Additionally, it was an initiative of the 
school to immerse students in STEM work throughout the year. 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Native Language support is provided through Native Language Glossaries, word for word interactive dictionaries, and 
translation of all letters and communication with parents. When a parent requires translation, the Language Access 
Coordinator works to ensure over-the-phone translation is utilized.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 Required services are provided in accordance with the levels of each student based on the level attained on the NYSITELL for 
newly enrolled students or the NYSESLAT. The students are heterogeneously grouped for ENL according to grade and class and 
taught within those groups according to their ENL level. Materials provided for ELL students are also grade appropriate. 
Imagine Learning instruction is based on each students' readiness. Every student takes a pretest and progresses at his or her 
own pace.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
  All newly enrolled students are offered the opportunity to tour the school prior to the school year. The Parent Coordinator is 
available throughout the summer school program to answer questions of newly enrolled students and many ENL students are 
offered a Title III Summer Program.  Additionally, a certified ENL teacher was available a week prior to the opening of school to 
assist with registration, Ell identification and answer questions.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

All students including ELL students are given Spanish instruction for at least a full year between Kindergarten and grade 8. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 The ENL staff will work with the Borough Field Support Team and the administration to enhance ENL instruction. In addition, 
we have contracted with Imagine Learning to provide support and professional development throughout the school year for 
ENL teachers, all staff and administration. The June Professional Development day will be used for ENL curriculum mapping. 
ENL teachers and teachers on the Professional Development team will turnkey any training that they have received and 
prepare and deliver Professional Development around ENL strategies. Additionally, ENL teachers are part of the Instructional 
Team which shares information and best practices across the grades. They provide a seamless approach to instruction as 
students progress through this K through 8 school.  
 
We have also created a Professional Learning Community this year that focuses specifically on ENL instruction.  The 
Community includes ENL teachers and classroom teachers as they explore the Language Progressions and ENL standards.  We 
are also providing a Professional Development  opportunity that will have classroom teachers and ENL teachers working 
collaboratively to gain an understanding of the Language Progressions and utilize them in the the development of their grade 
level curriculum maps.   
  
The Pupil Accounting Secretary has received training regarding the Home Language Surveys, registration and translation for 
ELLs.  The Parent Coordinator has received training regarding translation services for all parents. 
   
 All teachers including paraprofessionals, the School Psychologist and the Parent Coordinator have been trained in the 
utilization and data interpretation of the NYSESLAT exam and the Imagine Learning Program. They have also been provided 
with professional development on ESL strategies that are implemented in the regular day program. 
In order to provide a seamless approach to instruction, teachers on each grade level meet weekly with ENL providers to plan 
outlining the topics being covered in each subject area. This allows the ENL teachers to align the curriculum with the ENL 
program. The ENL teachers are also available to meet with the teachers of the grades they are servicing during common preps. 
In order to share best practices and provide turnkey training in ENL methodology, the ENL teachers meet with the Principal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

monthly for "Chats With the Principal", they are part of the PPC, LPT and Instructional Teams in order to help monitor the 
progress of our ELLs and to be a part of the decision making body for the school. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The grade 8 advisor provides support to our Ells as they transition from Middle to High School.  She works with the families and 
students to review high school choices and programs.  She works with the students and their families to complete applications 
with the assistance of a translator where needed.    All staff is given the mandated hours of training through common prep 
meetings where they meet with the ENL teachers to share best practices, monitor the progress of the ELLs and learn new ENL 
methodologies to meet the needs of their students. In addition, they meet monthly with the Principal to receive professional 
development on differentiation of instruction, the construct of the NYSESLAT exam and supporting ENL students including 
those woth special needs. They work as a team to analyze data to determine what areas are high priority based on the 
NYSESLAT 
modalities and and the EDAT. They meet with Borough Support Staff to identify new ways to work with our ELLs in order 
to continue to reach proficiency. The ESL staff will work with the Borough Field Support Team and the administration to 
enhance ENL instruction. In addition, we have contracted with Imagine Learning to provide support and professional 
development throughout the school year for ENL teachers, all staff and administration and with Tequipment to provide PD for 
all teachers in the use of the SmartBoard for differentiated Instruction. The June Professional Development day will be used for 
ENL curriculum mapping. ENL teachers will turnkey any training that they have received. Additionally, ENL teachers are part of 
the Instructional Team which shares information and best practices across the grades. They provide a seamless approach to 
instruction as students progress through this K through 8 school. Secretaries and the Parent Coordinator have received training 
regarding the Home Language Surveys, registration and translation for ELLs.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Tuesday Parent Engagement time is set aside for all teachers including ENL teachers to meet with parents individually to 
discuss their child's progress. Parents are also invited  to workshops several times a year conducted by classroom teachers, ENL 
staff and outside providers in an effort to support their children.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
The school staff, including the administration, the ENL teachers, classroom and specialty teachers, the parent coordinator and 
the support staff, work diligently to provide a welcoming atmosphere for the students, their parents and the community. All 
school related information is distributed to parents of ELLs in English or in the native language when available. Our parent 
coordinator provides assistance to newcomers, ELL students and their families. In addition to previously mentioned parental 
support, parents of ELLs are invited to parent conferences in September/ October, November, March and May. PS/IS 104 is 
aware of the supportive role parents play in the daily education of all students. A continual outreach is made to the parents of 
ELL students. Their lack of ability with the English language sometimes makes them reluctant to participate. On-going parent 
workshops, translations of most materials, use of translation services and family oriented activities throughout the school year, 
work to inform and involve these as well as mainstream parents. PTA meetings are held monthly at varying times to include all 
parents in school activities. In addition to the ENL Orientation, Open School Week and Parent Teacher Conferences, parents 
are invited to the school for various events such as: Grandparents Day, multicultural celebrations, assembly programs, student 
performances, Book Fair, classroom presentations and trips. Prior to the school year, we offer families the opportunity to tour 
the school if requested. In addition, we have launched a new website through E-Chalk to assist all parents in becoming

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Marie DiBella, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess our school's written and oral interpretation needs, we reviewed the following: 

a. review of the Home Language Surveys 

b. Parent requests to the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) 

c. Survey distributed by the Parent Coordinator requesting this information 

d. review of blue Emergency Contact cards  

e. review of the RHLA from ATS 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

At the beginning of each year, the Parent Coordinator, distributes a survey to all parents asking for their language 
of choice in receiving information. This survey is used to provide parents with information in their native language 
when available. This information is disseminated to all staff in order to ensure all materials are provided in the 
appropriate languages and all parents are able to be active participants in their child's education.  

We utilize the services of the Translation Unit to assist with the translation of all written communication to 
families and phone translations when needed. Translators are also available at all citywide Parent-Teacher 
conferences. We utilize a website through e-Chalk to assist all parents in becoming involved in their child's 
education. This website has been extremely helpful in parent involvement for ELL families as it allows them to 
translate information by simply pushing a button. In an effort to meet the identified needs of our school, we have 
implemented the School Messenger System, which translates into our primary languages, assisting parents in 
receiving pertinent school information including attendance. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

the events occur in the evenings, we 
will utilize translators for hire that are 
needed. When interpretation is 
needed for languages that are not 
spoken by staff at our school, when 
we know in advance, we ask 
neighboring schools for assistance or 
use the Translation unit with a staff 
member via phone or members of the 
PTA.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We utilize our School Messenger automated system that translates for families. In addition, we provide information 
through our school website which translates for parents as well. Additionally, we will begin using PupilPath where 
messages can be sent in preferred languages according to ATS. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We will train staff regarding Chancellor's Reg A-663 during our September Faculty Conference. During this training the 
goal of the regulation will be discussed and the translation unit phone contact will be distributed. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We shall provide translation and interpretation services to all parents who require language assistance in order to 
communicate effectively with the school. Parents may choose to rely on an adult friend/companion or relative for 
language and interpretation services. We will provide regular and timely provision of translated documents through 
either existing resources or the Translation and Interpretation Unit, timely provision of interpretation services at 
group and one-on-one meetings upon request when such services are necessary for parents to communicate with 
teachers, guidance counselors, school nurse and/or other school staff regarding critical information about their child’s 
education; the budgetary and staffing resources will be made available when possible to fulfill those needs. 

We will be responsible for providing each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require 
language assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights 
regarding translation and interpretation services. 

We will post in a conspicuous location at or near the primary entrance to such school a sign in each of the covered 
languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of interpretation services. 

Our safety plan will contain procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not 
prevented from reaching the school’s administrative offices solely due to language barriers.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will gather feedback from parents at parent meetings including PTA meetings, ENL workshops and through the 
Learning Environment Surveys. We will also gather feedback as to the quality of the services after parents utilize 
translation services.
