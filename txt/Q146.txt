Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

P.S. /M.S. 146Q, The Howard Beach School, takes pride in being a neighborhood school that is a “second home” for 
our students. Our goal is to develop the “whole child” both academically and socially. Our staff takes great pride in 
knowing their students and watching them grow from elementary through middle school. 

The mission of P.S./M.S. 146Q is to encourage a desire for learning, academic excellence, and respect for one another. 
Our Instructional Focus is to engage students in challenging written and oral tasks that deepen their understanding 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

and demonstrate their knowledge across all content areas. In addition, we are focused on improving students overall 
conceptualization of Mathematics standards. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

PS/MS 146Q, The Howard Beach School, is a community school of 621 students from 3K to Grade 8. 53% of our 
students identify as white, 38.59% are Hispanic, 5.14% are Asian, 1.45% are Black, 1.29% are American Indian or 
Alaskan Native. Of these students, 20.58% receive special education services. Our students with an IEP, receive 
services in the following ways: 

  4 self contained classes (K/1/2 bridge, grade 3, grade 4, and a 5/6 bridge) 
  9 ICT classes (K-8) 
  pull out/push in providers for related services and SETSS 

We strongly encourage student attendance and we have a variety of systems in place to maintain an attendance rate 
of 94%. 

The Instructional Focus for the 2018-2019 School Year is to engage students in challenging written and oral tasks that 
deepen their understanding and demonstrate their knowledge across all content areas. This instructional focus is the 
core of the Professional Learning Plan. Teachers in grades K-5 implement the Writing Revolution and utilize the 6 + 1 
Traits of Writing Rubric. In grades 6-8 we also implement the Writing Revolution across content areas, so writing is 
aligned to the instructional practices in all grades. Foundational skills have been built and established through 
professional learning, lead teachers and teacher teams. Writing rubrics are established and utilized by teachers in all 
subject areas in Kindergarten through grade 8. Student progress is monitored by the use of beginning, middle and end 
of the year writing prompts. Teachers analyze and utilize data to determine instructional next steps. To support 
continued implementation of 6 + 1 Writing Traits Rubric, teachers utilize a writing code with students, share best 
practices and adjust curriculum maps according to data . The Writing Revolution in grades 6-8 incorporates the inquiry 
cycle into the writing research of Judith Hochman and provides a scaffolded approach for developing both student 
writing and critical thinking skills as well as inquiry based learning among staff members. During teacher team 
meetings, teachers from all content areas meet to evaluate and determine areas of focus and develop next steps and 
strategies to help student achieve mastery of the writing skill. Teachers modified existing rubrics to incorporate the 
the targeted Writing Revolution skill.  

As a Computer Science for All School, professional learning is provided to staff by our library media specialist with a 
focus on incorporating technology as part of the daily learning in our classrooms. Our Teacher leaders have provided 
professional learning opportunities to aide in teacher understanding of educational Internet tools. As a result, the 
school has established school wide initiatives for the utilization technology in the classroom and at home. Parents are 
able to utilize and monitor all academic technological programs. We utilize Mathletics and First in Math to reinforce 
math fluency and target individual needs based on mathematical standards. Max Scholar is used in school and at 
home to advance individual learning needs in reading. 

We believe that teacher collaboration is essential for student success. The Teacher Teams at The Howard Beach 
School meet weekly to plan and design instruction that meets the individualized needs of each learner. Teams focus 
on analyzing student work and inquiry based curriculum development across all subject areas. Inquiry focuses on 
closing the gaps in learning identified by the utilization of a protocol and establishing a strategic action plan for 
student improvement. Curriculum maps are modified based upon the identified gaps in learning. Throughout the 
course of the year, teams adjust curriculum maps based upon formative and summative data as well as the 
professional learning experiences provided within the school by colleagues and consultants. They will continue this 
practice during the 2018-2019 school year. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

Thanks to our local Council Member, Eric Ulrich, P.S. /M.S. 146Q will once again partner with the Intrepid Sea, Air and 
Space Museum to provide our fourth grade students with a CASA (Cultural After School Adventure) program in which 
they learn all about life aboard the Intrepid and make three Saturday trips to the Intrepid Air and Space Museum. 
Other after school programs include the New York Edge program for grades K-5 and the Boys and Girls Club for grades 
6-8. PS 146Q is also an Urban Advantage School. Urban Advantage is a partnership between the New York City 
Department of Education and several cultural institutions in the city that focus on improving scientific research 
projects, teacher knowledge of science content and pedagogy as well as strengthening instructional practices.  

Parent involvement is an important part of our school community. Outreach and opportunities for parents to be 
involved with their child's social, emotional and academic growth are of the utmost importance. We have established 
an open door policy for parents to be involved in multiple aspects of their child's school career. Parent workshops are 
provided by our Parent Coordinator, staff members and outside facilitators to allow parents to be up to date on what 
is happening both in our school and the world around them. Workshops include information about our writing 
program, bullying, introduction to state testing and orientations for pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and middle 
school. In the 2018-2019 school year we will continue with student led conferences which allows students to take 
responsibility for their learning and makes parents aware of their child's personal academic goals. Additionally, we will 
continue with Sanford Harmony for grades K-4 and Overcoming Obstacles in grades 6-8. This year we will be piloting 
Restorative Circles in grades 5. All of these programs offer academic, social and emotional growth promoted by staff 
within the school to develop stronger social connections among students, and foster positive peer relationships that 
will enable students to thrive at school, at home, and as they grow into adulthood. Teachers in grade 5-8 are using 
Engrade to inform parents on how students are progressing throughout the school year. Engrade is an online grading 
system that allows parents to view and monitor their child's progress in all subject areas including details such as 
attendance, participation, projects and missed assignments. For the 2018-2019 school year we will continue to use 
the Parent Square APP to improve communication with families. This allows families to access the most current school 
information right from their cell phones. These systems contribute to improvement in the home/school connection. 

A positive school culture at The Howard Beach School is essential. We continually strive to put the needs of our 
students first in order to develop the “whole child.”  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Students with special needs make up 20.5% of the student population at PS 146Q. To address the needs of these 
students Teachers and school leaders meet to analyze student work to identify challenges and standards of concern. 
Station Teaching has been implemented in the Integrated Collaborative Teaching (ICT) classrooms. Inter-class 
visitations are provided to staff member to support the implementation of station teaching. This program targets the 
specific needs of Special Education students to assist in meeting Individualized Education Plan (IEP) goals and benefits 
all learners within the classroom. All grades implement lessons using various resources such as Engage NY to meet the 
needs of all learners. Our SETSS program is designed to support students using specially designed instruction, such as 
Wilson, in a General Education classroom. This “push in” program supports students in achieving their IEP (Individual 
Education Plan) goals within their least restrictive environment. To provide our self contained middle school students 
with the junior high school experience we have departmentalized our Bridge 6/7 12:1:1 class, so students have the 
opportunity to work with various special education teachers focused on specific content areas. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year progress has been made in the area of collaborative teachers. Teacher Teams meet weekly and 
analyze student data to modify instruction and curriculum maps based upon the identified needs of their students. 
Lead teachers guide teams through established protocols to identify instructional gaps. To sustain and continue 
growth in writing and establish a clear path for teacher pedagogy the Professional Learning committee will include 
lead teachers in the areas of ELA and math who will work directly with administration to establish a plan based on 
student outcomes and teacher input.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Based upon our yearly OORS summary report of time and location of most frequent incidents, we determined that 
there is a need to address our overall student support system and school aides' behavior management during the 
three lunch/recess periods. Additionally, our Framework fro Great School Report indicates an need for social 
emotional learning to build trust between students and staff. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will participate in professional development in social emotional learning (SEL) on 
incorporating SEL strategies and implementing character development courses in grades K-8 as evidenced by a 5% 
decrease in the number of level 3 incidents in OORS.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

PS/MS 146Q conducted a comprehensive assessment of our school's academic program in response to the 
Framework for Great Schools - Collaborative Teachers. This assessment was conducted by analyzing student 
performance data from the BOY to EOY of the 2017-2018 school year, feedback provided during visits by the 
Superintendent and the Principal Leadership Facilitator, a review of Teacher Team minutes and the NYC School 
Survey.  

Samples of student written work analyzed during Teacher Team meetings as well as feedback from teacher surveys 
indicate the need to continue the instructional focus on writing. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teacher teams will collaborate bi-weekly to analyze written student work across content areas to 
ensure inquiry driven instruction is provided in all classrooms across the grades as evidenced by a 10% increase in 
students meeting and/or exceeding the standards in writing utilizing the 6+1 Traits of Writing Rubric for grades K-5 and 
the Writing Assessment Rubric for grades 6-8.

-Utilize assessment data to inform classroom instruction, pacing, 
groupings, activities, RTI small group instruction and review. 

-Teachers will share data on Google Docs in order for other 
teachers on the grade to have access for the purposes of looking 
at grade trends, determining AIS support and share best 
practices. 

-Teams will analyze writing samples that meet CCLS by utilizing 
grade appropriate rubrics. Teams will provide specific feedback 
on student work analyzed to clarify next steps. 

90% of teachers will participate in Teacher Rounds and each 
team will collaborate to establish a problem of practice 
connected to writing and the instructional focus. Instructional 
rounds will be used to enhance teachers' pedagogical skills and 
develop a culture of collaboration. The purpose is for observing 
teachers to compare their own instructional practices with those 
of the teachers they observe. The benefit is in the discussion that 
takes place among observing teachers at the end of the 
observation as well as in subsequent self-reflection. 

The IEP teacher will meet with all teacher teams monthly to 
share strategies and scaffolds to support for SWD and at-risk 
students; such as, academic vocabulary and strategies to support 
special designed instruction. This will allow students to reinforce 
concepts and answer questions and explain their thinking. 

AIS will be provided by a licensed Reading Teacher to provide 
general education students identified as the lowest third explicit 
instruction on the reciprocity of reading and writing to support 
writing provided by classroom teachers. 

Expectations for writing will be shared with parents at open 
school night.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. The overall aim of 
this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of parents and community in the school. 
PS/MS 146Q, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating 
and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS/MS 146Q will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary (ESSA) Act;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use Fountas and Pinnell, guided reading group conferences, and individual running records for early literacy skills 
evaluations. Fountas and Pinnell is a one-on-one assessment tool that measures a student's progress in fluency and 
comprehension in reading. It is primarily used to guage a student's independent and instructional reading levels and to assign 
students to targeted guided reading groups.  This current year,  12 of our 15 ENL's who are in grades 1-6 are reading below 
grade level according to Fountas and Pinnell assessments.  In correlation with the results on the NYSESLAT, these assessments 
further our conclusion that reading and writing are the modalities which we need to support the most regarding our ENLs. This 
information allows the teachers of our ENL students to differentiate their lessons and activities in order to meet the needs of 
these students.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

The administration has implemented a schedule that mandates that each student is administered a Fountas and 
Pinnell assessment three times per year to measure progress. This data is posted on the school's Google docs page for teacher 
reference. In conjunction with our student population's overall performance on E.L.A. formative and summative assessments, 
the administration has revised the school's instructional focus to increase the attention given to writing skills across the 
curricula. Close reading strategies will continue to be utilized in every class and research-based writing programs are being 
implemented on all grade levels. These initiatives will serve our ENL population as well as our entire learning community. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Throughout the school year, we monitor the assessment results of our ENL students inside and outside of the ENL classroom 
using assessment tools such as Item Analysis tools provided by NYS. The E.N.L. teacher communicates with the classroom 
teachers about how her students are progressing in class and if the strategies she is providing them with are being utilized and 
if they are successful. We also review our NYS exam results to monitor how our ENL population is achieving and to determine 
which areas need the most attention. We also monitor the year-to-year progress of our ENL population based upon the 
NYSESLAT results. The collection of this data allows to evaluate the success of our program. Although we do not serve enough 
E.N.L. students to qualify for meeting AYP,  we study our E.N.L. data as a sub-group of our student population and measure its 
success against other sub-groups.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In order to analyze the data from the summative and baseline/benchmark assessments, our Teacher Teams on each grade 
meet weekly and and are programmed once per month to review the data for progress and to revise instructional strategies to 
address apparent learning and teaching gaps in instruction. Strategies are implemented in classrooms for 3 to four weeks and 
the results are discussed at a Teacher Team meeting during the following month to assess the outcomes of the strategies. We 
also have a reading/writing consultant who visits monthly with our teacher teams to introduce and assist in the 
implementation of the most current strategies to improve student achievement. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
As with the rest of the school population. our ENL students are administered baseline assessments and Fountas and Pinnell 
reading assessments to determine whether they are a Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 RTI student. Once a determination is made, the 
instructional plan is devised for each Tier and AIS recommendations are implemented.  We take into consideration the 
following applicable factors on a student-to-student basis: 
Number of years of instruction in a bilingual education or English as a new language program  
• English and home language literacy  
• Content area and socio-emotional support needs of students with inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE)  
• English and home language literacy needs of long-term ENLs  
• Results on the annual English language proficiency assessment exam  
• Bilingual education or English as a second language teacher recommendation  
• Content area teacher recommendation  
• Parent or guardian request  
• Sample of student work in English and, if possible, in the home language  
• Bilingual educational evaluation, if the student has or is suspected of having a disability  
Assessment of progress within the RTI program consists of our Teacher Teams looking at student work to recognize trends and 
gaps in learning and to modify the instruction to address those learning gaps. The formative assessments are in the forms of 
written assignments, teacher-student conferences, and oral presentations. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
On Grade 2, one student achieved a Commanding level. Three students remained on the Expanding level, one progressed from 
Transitioning to Expanding, one SWD advanced from Entering to Transitioning and one SWD advanced from Emerging to 
Transitioning. On Grade 3, our student remained on the Expanding level, but advanced significantly within each of the four 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

modalities. On Grade 4, One student achieved a Commanding Level. One student remained on the Expanding Level and one 
SWD progressed from Entering to Transitioning. On Grade 5, our student achieved a Commanding Level. On Grade 6, one 
student achieved a Commanding Level. One student progressed from Transitioning to Expanding. We also use the data from 
the NYS Exams to inform us of our ELLs progress and to make informed decisions about our E.N.L. program going forward.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Upon receiving the results of the most current NYSESLAT, the assistant principal and E.N.L. teacher meet and discuss if, and 
how, our expectations for our E.N.L. students were met based upon the results. After determining which of the modalities 
each individual student needs support in, decisions are made on curriculum, materials, strategies, and mapping for the 
upcoming school year in the E.N.L. classroom. Classroom teachers of the students are also informed of each student's needs 
and the E.N.L. teacher provides support to the teachers so that the student needs can be addressed throughout the school 
day.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The ENL Model utilized is a combination of push-in and pull-out for most of our students. Whenever possible, our 
E.L.L.s on the same grade are programmed in the same class section to allow for push-in teaching.  Integrated ENL is 
implemented through a pull-out and push-in approach, based on the needs of the student. The ENL teacher is dually 
certified in both Common Branch  and ENL, therefore she provides both stand alone and integrated ENL to all ENL 
students. Currently, our ENL classes are grouped heterogeneously ranging no more than 2 grade bands and no more 
than two proficiency levels apart.  For students who have tested proficient within the past two years, the E.N.L. 
teacher provides the required 90 minutes of instruction in a push-in capacity.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Students at the "Entering" level receive two units of study per week which totals 360 minutes. One of the two units is 
E.N.L. and the other unit is E.N.L./E.L.A. "Emerging" level students receive two units of study per week; 1 unit of study in E.N.L., 
1 unit of study in E.N.L./E.L.A. "Transitioning" level students receive 1 unit of study per week; .5 unit of study in stand alone 
E.N.L. and .5 unit of study in E.N.L./E.L.A. "Expanding" level students receive 1 unit of study per week in E.N.L./E.L.A. or other 
content areas. "Commanding" level students receive .5 unit of study per week of integrated E.N.L. in E.L.A. or other content 
areas.  
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.

   The instructional approach used to meet the needs of our ENL students is the Workshop Model.  This approach encompasses 
various strategies and techniques for ENLs.  Scaffolding and differentiated instructional techniques are used extensively.  We 
utilize explicit modeling techniques and students are guided through a task and emulate by example.  Within the content 
areas, vocabulary is emphasized through the use of word wall words and Total Physical Response strategies.  Students are 
encouraged to make personal connections to new subject matter using their knowledge and experiences.  Conceptualization is 
incorporated through the use of stories, poems and graphic organizers.  Cultural awareness and socialization are an important 
component of our daily focus.  The ENL students are exposed to a multi-sensory approach that promotes literacy through 
integrated instructional techniques.  Emphasis has been placed on incorporating balanced literacy into the curriculum stressing 
reading, writing and word work and moving from teacher support to student independence ("To, With and By").  All 
instructional techniques are used in conjunction with NYSED academic standards.  Within the classroom, bilingual dictionaries 
are readily available to assist our students with content area vocabulary and our newest curricla in ELA and Math provide 
translated documents on-line for them to use when necessary. In order to provide content area support, our E.N.L. teacher 
uses subject-specific texts and activities in the E.N.L. classroom. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   For our "Entering" level ENLs, our ENL teacher, Jessica Callaghan, presents her assessments in both english and the home 
languages of the students. For the rest of our students in our Freestanding ENL program, all assessments are administered in 
english. When necessary and permitted by the state, translated versions of state exams are provided to our E.N.L. students. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Although we currently do not have a SIFE population, our plan in the case a new registrant would be to identify the proficiency 
level of the student and to program the student for the mandated hours of E.N.L. classes. We would also have the E.N.L. 
teacher work closely with the subject area teachers to ensure that the necessary supports are in place throughout the school 
day. We would also engage our guidance counselor to support the SIFE student(s) in dealing with any socialization, emotional 
challenges. Newcomers receive differentiated instruction using various techniques across all proficiency levels.  Most ENLs in 
this group require a multi-sensory approach for instruction.  The four modalities are incorporated and align with standards-
based instruction. Again, the E.N.L. teacher works closely with the subject area teachers to ensure that the necessary supports 
are in place throughout the school day.   Newcomers can participate in all programs available including Fundations and 
other  Periodic Assessments. Additionally, students who will be mandated to take state examinations receive testing 
preparations in content area in class as well as ENL instruction. 
ENLs who are receiving service for four to six years and long-term ENLs continue in the various programs that are offered until 
they attain proficiency. More content area instruction is necessary to facilitate academic growth and language development. 
Strong emphasis is always on reading and writing skills, based upon the trends in results of the most current NYSESLAT. 
Analysis of the NYSESLAT as well as the State ELA and Math examinations determines individual needs for each student to 
attain proficiency.  
Former-ELLs receive .5 unit of study via a push-in model and continue to receive their testing accommodations. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ENL-SWD Instructional Strategies. Differentiated instruction with below, on, and above grade-level fiction and non-fiction texts 
are utilized within the ENL classroom to provide access to academic content areas. In order to accelerate English language 
development, tasks are scaffolded to reinforce learned English skills as well as to introduce and practice higher order skills. The 
ENL teacher has access to texts and other materials being used in her students' subject area classrooms and supports that 
learning with cross-curriculum reading assignments and interdisciplinary tasks. All texts and materials utilized are common 
core aligned and meet the standards of each specific subject area. Additionally, our E.N.L. teacher assigns reading and writing 
content-area-based projects in science and social studies that support their grade level curricula. To ensure that all of our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

E.N.L.-S.W.D. receive all of their mandated services as per their I.E.P., the programming of these students are completed by a 
team whose specific goal is to ensure just that. All classroom teachers and related service providers have access to SESIS and 
monitor their own students' I.E.P. to ensure that all accommodations are provided. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
As often as possible the E.N.L. teacher pushes in to the ELL-SWD classroom to align their training with the work being done in 
the classroom. She also contributes to the lessons so that all students in the classroom may benefit from the strategies being 
implemented. Communication between the E.N.L. and Special education teacher(s) , as well as with the para-professionals 
assigned to these students occurs on a regular basis to put in place a concentrated support system to assist the student in 
achieving English profiency with respect to their I.E.P. goals. Additionally, ELL-SWD are mainstreamed into General education 
classes as often as possible to afford them the opportunity to increase their proficiency in these subject areas and therefore 
improve their English proficiency. At each Annual and Mandated Three-Year Review, the possibility of initiating or increasing 
the number of mainstreamed periods and subjects are part of the discussion.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ENLs participate in targeted intervention programs which include Response to Intervention curriculum,  Fundations (ELA), and 
Academic Intervention Services services in ELA.  We also utilize MYon Reading and Mathletics computer programs as academic 
interventions. These intervention services are offered in English. Primarily, students who achieve lower than a Performance 
Level of 3 on the NYS  ELA or Math exams are targeted for these intervention services.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

As a school, we utilize the  ELA curricula (ReadyGen and Codex) at the elementary and middle school levels, respectively. Along 
with this, our teaching practices are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and therefore, our preparation for 
the NYSESLAT will be current and appropriate.  We are also expanding our A.I.S. program to reach more of our student 
population. The ENL teacher will also support former ELL's by providing them with academic support as they transition into 
their English proficient classrooms. Additionally, the computer program Languagenut, a language learning software,  was 
purchased for the ENL classroom to support the needs of ELL's at all levels both at school and at home.  As stated earlier, we 
also programmed our same grade students into the same class section so that more of a push-in approach by our E.N.L. 
teacher can be utilized.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not Applicable 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 All ELLs are afforded equal access to academic programs, after-school programs, social development programs such as student 
advisory, CHAMPS,  Foreign language class and club, Drama club, Technology, ARTS, Regents and any other existing programs 
or programs that we may initiate for our students.  Funding is via Fair Student Funding for after school programs and Saturday 
Academy. Our C.B.O.s Boys and Girls Club of Metro Queens and SASF provide academic assistance to all students who join.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 Avenue/Hampton Brown and High Point/Hampton Brown are used in teaching ELA and content areas through ENL 
methodologies and techniques which aid in the development of all four modalities.  The use of high interest level libraries, Big 
Books and listening centers support ENL instruction.  Read-Alouds, shared reading and guided reading are instructional 
strategies that are consistently used to encourage and support listening skills and reading and writing responses.  For content 
area instructional resources, we utilize Common Core aligned,  high interest texts differentiated based on student reading 
levels and interest.  Regarding classroom technology assets,  all classrooms are equipped with Smart Boards and internet 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

access to utilize a vast array of on-line instructional support, such as the language learning software Languagenut and Brainpop 
ESL. We also utilize myON reading and Mathletics computer programs as academic interventions.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 In our E.N.L. program model Native Language support is provided through the use of bi-lingual dictionaries/testing materials 
and glossaries.  When needed, native language speaking para-professionals support our overall instructional efforts.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our E.L.L.s on the same grade are programmed in the same class section to allow for push-in teaching.  Integrated ENL is 
implemented through a pull-out and push-in approach, based on the needs of the student. Our ENL classes are grouped 
heterogeneously ranging no more than 2 grade bands and no more than two proficiency levels apart. All content and materials 
used to advance language development in appropriate to age and grade level. "Entering" and "Emerging" level students are 
provided with multi-scaffolded lessons. The level of assistance gradually diminishes as the level of proficiency of each student 
increases.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Not applicable 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 We assist newly enrolled students before the beginning of the school year by parent outreach, via our translation services 
provided on our school web site and parent coordinator, a student orientation and school visit and "Open House" where 2-3 
books are  provided free to the student to read over the summer. Students who enroll during the year are immersed into their 
content-area classes and immediately begin attending their mandated ENL service periods. Classroom teachers are apprised of 
the student's levels by the ENL teacher and provide supports and strategies as necessary. Parents are invited to attend a 
parent orientation session, where the ENL program is discussed and information regarding school happenings is shared. On 
Parent Engagement Tuesdays throughout the year, E.N.L. parents are invited to meet with our E.N>L. teacher to discuss their 
child's progress.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our grades 6-8 students, E.N.L. students included, are all programmed for Spanish as a LOTE class. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 Our ENL Teacher, Ms. Callaghan, attends monthly professional development sessions provided by our Borough Support Center 
ENL Liaison. Some examples of the type of professional development sessions attended include, analyzing data to further assist 
ELL’s at various levels, ELL’s and RTI, implementing the Common Core Standards in the ENL classroom, preparing students for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

the newly aligned C.C.L.S. NYSESLAT, developing questioning and discussion techniques suited for ELL’s as per Danielson, and 
the use of Depth of Knowledge.  Aside from attending professional development sessions,  Ms. Callaghan actively participates 
on a Teacher Team which meets at least once per week during which various professional activities are planned and 
executed.  In addition,  Ms. Callaghan also conducts professional development sessions for classroom teachers and 
paraprofessionals  sharing strategies and techniques that will help ELL's in the classroom. Topics of these workshops include, 
"Understanding and Aiding the Entering/Emerging ELL", "Understanding and Aiding the Transitioning ELL", "Best Practices for 
Teaching ELLS", and "Understanding and Aiding the Advanced ELL".  
In order to help ELL students meet the requirements of the new  Common Core Standards, teachers of ELL's are provided with 
multiple opportunities to engage in professional development that support these new changes. Such professional 
developments include but are not limited to, questioning and discussion techniques as outlined in Danielson, Depth of 
Knowledge, data analysis of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to support ELL subgroups, and differentiation and scaffolding 
strategies that enhance ENL instruction. Teachers are offered the opportunity to attend professional learning opportunities on 
aligning their curricula to the C.C.L.S. and those who attend turnkey the information to their peers during Monday P.L.O. 
sessions.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
To support our staff in assisting our ELLs in transitioning from elementary to middle school and from middle school to high 
school, we offer professional development on assessing students for R.T.I. on all grade levels, on the academic, social, and 
emotional growth differences between elementary and middle school students, as well as on ways to develop independence 
and responsibility in preparation for high school. Our advisory program benefits our students as well as our staff in learning 
and sharing about the challenges facing students in and outside of school at the middle school age level. Professional 
Development on the Common Core Learning Standards also prepares our staff to best prepare our students for the transition 
to the next grade level.  Guidance Counselors receive professional development via our Network and our ESL Teacher 
regarding ELL transitions.  
 We provide the minimum 15 percent of professional development requirements for all staff through our PD Plan throughout 
the year.  Our Supervisors and ENL teacher provide this support which is research-based and turnkey strategies from our 
Borough Support Center PD and NYCDOE Resources.  Specific and differentiated learning strategies in ELA, Math, Social Studies 
and Science are presented via PD, Study Groups and Teacher Team collaborative meetings. All personnel also engage in PD 
that presents various strategies to aid in assisting ELL's in the mainstream classroom. PD's include topics such as language 
acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
English language learners,  ReadyGen and Codex curriculum training focusing on differentiation strategies, Depth of 
Knowledge, Questioning skills with special focus of components 3b, 3c, and 3d in Danielson, and strategies provided by the ENL 
teacher to classroom teachers on effective methods to help ELL's succeed with the Common Core Standards. The ENL teacher 
receives 50 percent of professional development hours in ELL specific PD by attending offerings by the city. All teachers keep 
record of their attendance at these PD's by maintaining an attendance log or keeping the agendas for each PD that they 
attend.       
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher sets up individual appointments throughout the year with each ELL's parent/guardian to discuss the student's 
language development progress, language proficiency assessments and language development needs in content areas. The 
meetings are offered during the school day or during the designated time allotted for parent outreach on Tuesdays.  If 
translation services are needed, the ENL teacher works with the parent coordinator to set up an appointment for a translator 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

 

from a DOE approved vendor "The Big Word" to be present. The N.Y.C.D.O.E. Translation and Interpretation Unit is also used 
when necessary. The ENL teacher ensures attendance records and parent contact forms from the meetings are signed and 
stored.     

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
 All parents and guardians are actively involved in our school via our School Leadership Team (SLT), Parent-Teacher Association 
(PTA), “Meet the Teacher Night”, Parent-Conferences, liaison with our Parent Coordinator, Open School Week, school trips and 
family activities and monthly parent information sessions.  Our DOE Web Site and independent school-run eCHALK Web Site 
supports our high level of parent involvement and can be translated into 53 languages. Annual Learning Environment Survey 
data confirms that our parents are actively involved in all aspects of our school community. Parents and guardians of ELLs are 
involved in the above and an annual ELL Parent Outreach and Information session which is held in the fall of each year.  Due to 
the importance of parent involvement, the Principal and Assistant Principals take an active role in planning and conducting 
activities.  Our school Parent Coordinator is the direct liaison to parents. Additionally, the ENL teacher ensures that parents are 
aware of events and activities in the school by sending home a monthly newsletter, translated into the appropriate language, 
to keep all ELL parents up to date on school happenings and what their child in learning in the ESL classroom. The monthly 
newsletter also includes a "teacher tip" section where the ENL teacher provides a strategy, technique, website or article that 
ELL parents can use to help their children at home.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Mary Keegan, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Initially, at the time of registration, our Pupil Personnel Secretary, Christine Armao, asks the parents/guardians of 
the new student(s) in which language they would like to receive verbal and written communications from the 
school. We also refer to the Home Language Survey on which it states in Part III in which language the 
parents/guardians prefer to receive written and verbal communication. It is also entered into ATS for 
informational purposes. We refer to the RCPL and RAPL ATS reports for further information about parent home 
language preferences. We also ask parents and guardians to answer that question on our school's Blue Emergency 
cards so that when any adult is contacting the home, they know which language is needed for communication. 
Our school's website containing all pertinent information translates into all the languages used by the families of 
our students. Additionally, school notices and documents are translated into appropriate languages and academic 
reports such as progress reports and academic/behavior monitoring sheets are also translated. During our PTA 
meetings and Open School activities, translators are scheduled to attend and are available to attend meetings.

  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

A Welcome Poster is displayed in the main lobby upon entrance to the building. Language ID Guides are posted on the 
Safety Agents desk and on the Main Office counter. The Parents' Bill of Rights and the Parents' Guide to Language 
Access are available via a link on our school website. A hard copy in English and Spanish of the Parents' Bill of Rights is 
available in the Main Office of the school. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Each year we distribute the NYC Learning Environment Survey and review its data for feedback on our quality of 
service to our parents with translation needs. Our Parent Coordinator ensures that all parents receive the services 
they need and request if they are satisfied or if additional assistance is needed. Our E.N.L. teacher, Ms. Callaghan asks 
each parent/guardian of our E.L.L.s if they received and understood the information provided to them in their 
preferred language. Administrators verify with parents if they received the translation services they needed during 
conferences and meetings.
