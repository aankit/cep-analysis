Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 158 is a nurturing, learning community committed to educating the whole child. Our inclusive school environment 
encourages the abilities and talents of our students by providing varied opportunities and resources for each child to 
develop social-emotional, academic, creative, and leadership potential. This belief drives all decisions made at the 
school.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
We are a large school of nearly 800 students, but create a congenial and familial community through the emphasis on 
small group instruction, art enrichment and family engagement. We have a very active parent body that we welcome 
into the school for numerous occasions, including fundraisers, monthly family mornings in the classroom, workshops, 
PA meetings and conferences. We have a very culturally diverse community, representing families from six 
continents. Our melting pot community lends itself to our focus on equity within our school, as reflected in our 
students, staff and instruction. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have a diverse student population, comprised of children with special learning needs, English Language learners 
as well as students at all levels of the general education population. To meet the needs of all our students our SETSS 
teacher, ELL teacher, Special Education staff developer, literacy and math coaches all work closely with the classroom 
teachers to support each students specific learning needs. With respect and trust, students, faculty, staff and families, 
are committed to developing life-long learners in school and beyond. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

It was noted in our 2017-2018 Principals Performance Observation (PPO) that our school has a coherent vision of 
school improvement that is reflected in a short list of focused, data-based goals that are tracked for progress and 
supported by the entire community. In addition, across classrooms, teachers use or create assessments, rubrics and 
grading policies that are aligned with the school's curricula and offer a clear portrait of student mastery. Student 
discussions reflect high levels and student thinking, participation and ownership of learning.  

We continue to focus our Professional Development (PD) school wide in specific areas of math, ELA and social-
emotional learning and our school was recognized in the QR as a “professional development learning site”. All of the 
goals that we set are thoughtfully aligned to Danielson’s rubric, which is the backdrop for what our school considers 
to be rigorous instruction.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In the 2017-2018 school year, the School Leaders and the Professional Development Committee participated in fours 
guided walkthroughs in literacy and math to learn patterns, trends and areas for improvement with the contracted 
vendors in literacy and Informed by the observations and post-walkthrough conversations, it was evident that 
teachers had made growth in the area of small group instruction. To deepen and extend this work, continuous work 
on small group instruction, will create rich opportunities for students to engage in conversation, in which they 
synthesize, question, justify, critique, and examine each other’s ideas.  

 

According to our school’s most recent PPO in 2017-2018, PS 158 is highly effective in aligning curriculum to the 
common core and provide students with consistent opportunities to engage in learning. To that end to extend the 
thoughtful practice of rigorous instruction, our school is broadening its scope of rigorous instruction to foster 
interactive classrooms, rich student discussions and critical thinking when speaking and listening.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 1, 2019, teachers will design or revise a minimum of ten conferences per week. Teacher observations and 
recorded data of small group conversations will measure the rigorous work students will engage in based on these 
conferences and a rubric co-created by the professional development committee, school leadership and staff 
developers will be used to quantify students' engagements in conferring.

school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Looking at the 2018 NYC School Survey Report 

  57% of teachers say that adults at their school have access to school based supports to assist in behavioral 

and emotional escalations. 

  68% of teachers say that adults at their school teach students the skills they need to regulate their behavior 

(by focusing their attention, controlling their emotions, managing their thinking, behavior and feelings. 

Informed by the Capacity Framework Element-Supportive Environment and the NYC School Survey, in order to foster 
a supportive classroom environment we need to equip our teachers with strategies to proactively address the social-
emotional needs of the student. The needs assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 1, 2019, the principal, assistant principal and staff developers will receive training through the RULER program 
and corresponding Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence to support staff with strategies to address students' social 
and emotional skills effectively in the classroom in order to reduce the number of level 4 and 5 incidents in the OORS 
portal to 40 or less. The participation in and information provided during these professional learning opportunities 
will be memorialized in sign-in sheets and notes will be kept by the special education coach and made available to 
staff at any time. The principal and assistant principal will assess the effectiveness of the professional development 
opportunities by monitoring staff feedback through grade-level meetings and informal surveys.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Looking at the 2018 NYC School Survey Report, teachers indicate a high level of collaboration: 

 

  77% of teachers responding to the survey agreed that teachers at this school take responsibility for improving 

the school. 

  80% of teachers responding to the survey agreed that at this school the principal, teachers, and staff 

collaborate to make the school run effectively. 

  56% of teachers responding to the survey agreed that professional development experiences this year have 

included enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas. 

Our school's PPO in 2017-2018 noted that although every teacher participates in many collaborative efforts that 
center on improving student outcomes and teaching practice. Teachers are empowered to lead their colleagues in 
both formal and informal ways. The teachers and school leadership agreed that perhaps the implementation of more 
structured protocols and agendas might help them strengthen their use of time even more and guarantee everyone's 
equitable participation. 

 

Informed by the Capacity for Framework Element – Collaborative Teachers, NYC School Survey, and Quality Review, in 
order to strengthen teacher capacity to share reflections of classroom practices and provide coherently focused and 
sustained professional development experiences, we need to engage the teachers of our school in planning and 
evaluating professional development experiences. We need protocols to insure equity of voice and effective use of 
time within teacher team meetings and pathways to turnkey information to the larger learning community. This 
needs assessment informed the development of the goal below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 1, 2019, teacher members of the professional development committee will meet over a minimum of eight 
sessions to identify topics of professional development, evaluate ongoing work, and to plan pathways to turnkey 
information to the larger learning community using a variety of protocols to insure equity of voice for meeting

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Looking at the 2018 NYC school survey, teacher and family responses were 96% positive regarding the school's 
outreach to parents. That percentage was commensurate with the district average and slightly greater than the 
Citywide average.  

Informed by the Capacity Framework Element - Strong Family and Community Ties and the NYC School Survey, in 
order to strengthen family and community ties we need to engage families with educators to expand their 
understanding of the instructional and social emotional goals we are setting for our community. If the families 
understand more about these goals they can then better support their children. The needs assessment informed the 
development of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 1, 2019, the school will hold a minimum of eight family engagement events designed to deepen the 
home/school connection and give parents/guardians tools and strategies to support their child(ren)’s instructional and 
social/emotional growth. The focus of these workshops and family events will parenting education on a variety of 
topics, such as; equity, digital citizenship, purposeful play, Mathematical Mindsets, puberty, home learning and conflict 
v. bullying. Participation will be measured through sign in sheets and content will be memorialized in handouts and 
media presentations. The information will be made available through our school website. The impact of these events 
will be seen in stronger and more authentic parent/guardian support of their children’s performance throughout the 
school year.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 158, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS 158 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

We have noticed that our younger ENL students need support in their oral language skills as well 
as their fluency and reading comprehension through studying NYSESLAT results and Teachers 
College MOSL running records as well as through informal classroom observations. Therefore, 
these students will be invited to attend a morning Reader's Theater program for 60 minutes twice 
a week, where they will participate in reading poetry, listening to stories, reading stories, and 
then writing scripts and acting out stories of their own. The ENL students in grades 1-2 will be 
invited to attend a before school program on Thursdays and Fridays from 7:30-8:30 am for a 
total of 2 hours per week. There will be 16 students including 5 new comers and 11 
developing ELLs.  The group will be co-taught by the ENL teacher and 2 general education 
teachers and the program will run from January 16, 2019  through May 31, 2019 for a total of 18 
weeks. The students will be co-taught by two licensed teachers and one ENL teacher with the 
direct instruction model in 1:6 or 1:7 teacher student ratio. The ENL teacher will provide the 
same amount of instruction as the teachers in the program. The integrated instruction model will 
also be used to support the needs of our ELLs provided ENL strategies by the ENL teacher in a 
small group setting.  We have noticed that our ELLs in grades 1-2 need support in developing 
their listening skills, their fluency and their reading comprehension.  Therefore, this program will 
use Reader's Theater as a way to support students' listening and reading comprehension, and give 
students the opportunity to also practice their writing and speaking skills.  We want the program 
to be fun and engaging for students while also supporting their English language development. 
Throughout the program, students will use listening centers to listen to stories as well as 
participate in shared reading and read-aloud experiences. They will then work collaboratively in 
groups in order to write scripts and perform Reader's Theater pieces. We will use and purchase 
Nursery Rhyme Reader’s Theater scripts (nursery rhyme set) to support students in fluency work 
and to introduce them to reading and performing scripts.  We will also purchase chart paper and 
art supplies that students can use to make masks and set designs to perform their stories.  These 
nursery rhyme scripts will be purchased and used exclusively in the Title III program for the 
duration of the plan. 
In addition, upon studying classroom assessments as well as NYSESLAT results, we observed 
that our 4-5 graders need to perform better in the areas of reading and writing. This shows 
that our ELL students need additional support in reading comprehension as well as writing 
essays. We have also noticed through classroom observations that students tend to be stronger in 
reading and writing about fiction texts and need support in reading, comprehending and writing 
about non-fiction texts. Additionally, our math assessments and classroom observations have 
showed that while many of our ELLs have strong number sense, they need support with solving 
story problems and approaching math problems in different ways. To help improve these areas 
and to show gains in NYSESLAT and math assessment results, all the ENL students in grades 4-
5, total of 13 students including 3 new comers and 10 developing ELLs, will receive 
supplemental support in an after school program which will focus on Literacy and Math. The 
program will begin Wednesday January 9 and run through Wednesday May 8, 2019 for a total of 
15 weeks.  Students will attend the program on Wednesdays for 2 hours (2:50- 4:50 pm), and

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
will be co- taught by an ENL certified teacher, a 4th grade classroom teacher and a 5th grade 
classroom teacher. Each 120 minute session will be divided into two 60 minute sessions, where 
one session will be devoted to Literacy and the other to Math.  The 4th grade students will work 
on math first with the 4th grade teacher, while the ENL teacher works on literacy with the 5th 
graders and the 5th grade teacher.  In the second hour, the ENL teacher will work on literacy 
instruction with the 4th graders and the 4th grade teacher, while the 5th graders work on math 
instruction with the 5th grade teacher.  The Literacy portion of our program will focus on 
developing students’ literacy strategies and skills needed when engaging in non-fiction 
text, while developing reading and writing skills. In addition, activities will focus on helping 
children express their critical thinking skills in the English language. Necessary materials will 
include books of various reading levels from reading A to Z and reading passages that align with 
the Common Core expectations from Readworks and Time for Kids. We will also use 
technology such as projectors and Brainpop in order to support student engagement and 
comprehension by providing the visual support. The Math portion will focus on problem solving, 
algebraic thinking and test taking strategies, with a focus on written and oral responses.  The 
only supplies that we intend to purchase are composition notebooks, where students will practice 
writing about reading and note- taking when reading non- fiction texts.

Begin description here:            
There will be continuous collaboration between the ENL teacher and classroom teachers 
throughout the school year. We will implement six study group sessions for the ENL teacher and 
6 classroom teachers who are supporting ENL students in the Title III program and in the 
classrooms.  During these sessions, the teachers will discuss and develop teaching strategies 
through the texts and sharing their teaching experiences. The ENL teacher will also turn key the 
new information from the ELL related workshops, meetings and conferences.  
Since we have noticed that many of our upper grade ELL students are struggling to 
independently read and comprehend complex texts, during the first three sessions, the study 
group will focus on effective ENL teaching strategies and methods and close reading 
techniques to support our ENL students' achievement. The group will meet on November 5, 12 
and 19 from 2:50- 4:10 during our school- wide weekly Monday PD time. The texts that will be 
reviewed and discussed are Close Reading for the Whole Class by Sandra Athans and Reading, 
Writing, and Learning in ESL by Suzanne Peregoy and Owen Boyle. The topics that the teacher 
will study and discuss include: Language Proficiency levels and matching questioning and 
teaching techniques to each language proficiency level, using Close Reading to tackle 
difficult vocabulary and using Close Reading to help students strengthen their independent 
reading skills. 
In addition, the study group will also focus on supporting lower grade ENL students’ fluency and 
reading comprehension.  We have noticed that our lower grade students’ fluency has affected 
their comprehension, so we hope that the Reader’s Theater program will support both their 
fluency and reading comprehension and allow them to begin independently reading and more 
difficult books.  The group will meet on January 7, 14 and 21 from 2:50- 4:10 during our school-
wide weekly Monday PD time. We plan on using Reader's Theater as well as the text, From 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

 

Part C: Professional Development  
Phonics to Fluency: Effective Teaching of Decoding and Reading Fluency by Timothy V. 
Rasinski, to incorporate and develop teaching strategies. The topics will include: Language 
Proficiency levels and why fluency may be difficult for students at each level, using Reader's 
Theater to teach language skills such a vocabulary and grammar structures as well as develop 
fluency, and how Reader's Theater can help students practice listening, speaking, reading and 
writing. 
This study group will be at no cost to the Title III program.  
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as

Begin description here:            
Since parent support is a key determinant of child's education, their involvement is an essential 
component in the program. In order to support ELL parents, we will develop a series of ENL 
parent workshops. The ENL teacher will plan and provide the workshops to the parents.  On 
December 11, before the Title III program starts, parents will be invited to participate in the 
informative sessions for before school and after school ENL programs, which will be about 4-5 
Grade Literacy & Math program and 1-2 Grade Reader's Theater program. Parents will be 
informed of the focus of each program and teaching strategies students will be learning to 
improve their English skills. Parents will be also invited to attend workshops on February 12, 
March 12, and April 16, 2019 from 7:30-8:30am during parent engagement time. Through these 
workshops, parents will have the opportunity to learn and discuss the following topics; 
understanding the needs of ELL students to build their second language acquisition(February 
12), effective ENL strategies, games and materials that they can use to help their children 
at home(March 12), and learning ways to prepare their children for the NYS Standardized Exams 
and NYSESLAT(April 16). We plan to use $200 to provide refreshments for parents on the first 
and the last day of the parent workshops.  We hope that these workshops will help our ELL 
parents to gain a better understanding of ways to support their children at home.  
Parents will be invited to the workshops by receiving a flyer notifying them of the time and the 
place for each workshop.  All letters and flyers will be distributed according to parents' language 
requests.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At PS 158, TCRWP is used to formally assess all students. Throughout the year, every student is assessed using spelling 
inventory, writing on demand, and TC running records.  Aside from the four formal assessment periods throughout the year, 
students are also assessed as needed to determine their progress in meeting benchmarks.  These assessments are valuable in 
disclosing to classroom teachers that many of our ELLs, already quite literate in their home languages, quickly acquire English 
language decoding skills that far outpace their capacity to comprehend what they’re reading. Our students’ decoding 
competency sometimes takes only a few months, while the vocabulary development requires many years even for those 
children with extensive L1 lexicons. Without these assessments, classroom teachers would otherwise overestimate ELLs’ 
reading, since in some cases their oral reading may even sound more competent than their monolingual peers’. Additionally, 
the ENL teacher has access to these assessments and uses students' progress and performance on them in order to inform her 
own instruction and planning.  She also works collaboratively with teachers to analyze assessments in order to determine

students' language needs and how they can best be supported in the classroom by both the ENL teacher and the classroom 
teacher.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have 4 formal assessment periods per year, where classroom teachers are required to give students formal assessments in 
literacy and math, and then share students' data, compared to grade- level benchmarks, with the administration and support 
staff. The assessment data is disseminated through grade team meeting and used to plan instruction for ELLs. The ENL teacher 
works with classroom teachers to administer these assessments and analyze student' results. Additionally, the formal 
assessments that we use are consistent across grade levels, so that teachers are familiar with the assessments and students' 
reading skills can be compared to other students across the grade, regardless of their language and proficiency level. We then 
use the data from these assessments to guide our small group instruction, which consists of strategy groups, guided reading, 
shared reading, and interactive writing. Each of these types of small groups help students to improve their reading and writing 
levels by focusing on fluency, reading comprehension, and both encoding and decoding skills. The assessment data also 
informs the ENL teacher about next steps for her instruction, including ways to support students' reading and writing skills 
along with their language development. 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The ENL teacher is in regular contact with parents and classroom teachers in order to monitor and discuss any difficulties or 
struggles students may be experiencing.  We analyze assessments regularly in order to determine how students are 
progressing and if they would benefit from any additional supports or changes to the program.  Additionally, portfolios of 
student work and in- class assessments are maintained by the ENL teacher and are analyzed regularly and shared with 
classroom teachers and parents at meetings. These dated portfolios assist in monitoring students' progress and determining if 
there should be any program changes in order to better support the child. In order to evaluate the program as a whole, we 
also diligently study students' NYSESLAT results as well as their Math and ELA state test results in order to determine how our 
ENL program currently supports students' performance on these exams and where we may be lacking.  We also use the EDAT 
tool to help us identify which students are not making annual progress on the NYSESLAT and how we may be able to adjust the 
ENL program in order to accommodate these students' needs.  NYSELAT results show that our students have strong speaking 
skills.  Students require more support in reading and writing.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The ENL teacher meets regularly with parents and classroom teachers to monitor students' progress and determine when 
students require interventions, as well as how students are responding to these interventions. The ENL teacher also works 
with the intervention and SETSS teachers to determine which students require more consistent small- group instruction and 
targeted intervention. She then meets regularly with these teachers to monitor students' progress and modify ENL instruction, 
as needed.  This targeted intervention consists of small group instruction, focusing on word work strategies, writing skills, and 
shared reading experiences. The intervention and SETSS teachers frequently assess students in order to monitor their progress 
and request additional interventions, if necessary. 
Additionally, the ENL teacher uses the EDAT and NYSESLAT data to inform the classroom teachers about modifying their 
instruction in order to meet students' needs and support students' language and academic development. She also uses this 
data to inform her own instruction and plans both unit and lesson plans that address students' needs. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Students' results on the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL are used in conjunction with assessments given by the classroom teacher in 
order to determine which students may require RTI support.  We also review the number of instructions in ENL/bilingual 
services and literacy level in their home language. For students that require RTI support, the ENL teacher and classroom 
teachers work collaboratively to determine a specific area or skill that should be targeted in order to best meet the student's 
needs.  The student is then given a "double dose of instruction" that includes extra attention, activities and experiences to 
target their needs.  This instruction is in addition to the core instruction and ENL instruction the student is already 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

 

receiving.  After a few weeks, the student is then assessed again on the skill that was being targeted.  This assessment, as well 
as more recent classroom assessments and observations, are used by the ENL teacher and classroom teacher to decide if the 
student still requires the extra instruction, or if they can return to receiving the core instruction and ENL instruction they had 
originally. These assessment results also determine if students require intense intervention, where they receive more 
individualized instruction in small groups or 1:1.  After another few weeks, students are assessed again to determine progress 
and additional next steps.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Upon examination of our NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data, we discovered that most of our students that have been here for 2 or 
more years scored at the Commanding or the Expanding Level. Students that have only been learning English for the past year 
or so scored at the Emerging and Transitioning level. The only students that scored as Entering are newcomers who are new to 
the school, the country, and to English language in general.  Therefore, students' performance on the NYSESLAT shows that 
most students are making progress in their English language use, and that our ENL program is supporting students in 
developing both their English and academic skills. However, upon further examination of the data, we realized that many of 
our students perform very well on the speaking component of the NYSESLAT, and may need more support in reading and 
writing.  We will also incorporate ELA and math scores to evaluate ENL program holistically.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

When developing unit and less plans for both push in and pull out instruction, the ENL teacher ensures that every lesson has a 
Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking component. This allows students to practice all four modalities consistently, while 
also studying content- based material. Additionally, The ENL teacher accesses RLAT data from ATS for NYSESLAT scores and 
the EDAT to determine which areas students may require more instruction, whether individually or as a group.  These data are 
also reviewed by the ENL teacher to identify focus of instruction and adjust the ENL program to meet students' need.  All 
adjustments are consulted with administrators.  These adjustments are made after NYSESLAT scores are released. Given 
that  analysis of the data reveals that students seem to require additional support in Listening and Writing, the ENL teacher is 
careful to regularly target these skills by planning tasks and assignments that focus on students' listening and writing 
development. For example, students learn strategies like previewing vocabulary and picture supports in order to help them 
improve their listening comprehension. Students also receive targeted instruction around planning and organizing writing 
pieces, which helps them to develop their English writing skills. The ENL teacher also works with classroom teachers and other 
specialists to discuss and implement ways that all teachers can support students in these skills throughout the day, and how 
they can target this instruction for students. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students at "entering" and "emerging" levels are pulled out  for "standalone ENL" in groups that are made up of 
students from 2 grades but different classes. These lessons involve thematic language instruction that aligns with the 
work that students are doing in their classrooms.  The ENL teacher then pushes in to work with ELL's that are on the 
same grade level but different proficiency levels in a general education classroom, where students receive "integrated 
ENL" with both the ENL teacher and a classroom teacher.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teacher, 
along with all classroom teachers on the grade, to determine how to best meet the instructional needs of the 
students and what aspect of the core curriculum should be addressed during "integrated ENL." Usually, this involves 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

literacy instruction, supporting students with their reading, writing and language needs. 
ENL in both situations is taught through balanced literacy. Each lesson is tailored to meet the individual needs of the 
students. Differentiated instruction and scaffolding is at the base of each lesson. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

not applicable. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Paste response to questions here:    

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            The mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency level. In order to be in compliance 
with CR Part 154, students at the Entering and Emerging stages receive standalone ENL 4 periods a week for 180 minutes and 
integrated ENL 4 periods a week for an additional 180 minutes.  The students that are Transitioning and Expanding receive 
Integrated ENL 4 periods a week for 180 minutes.  Students that are Commanding receive 2 periods a week for 90 minutes of 
integrated ENL instruction. The ENL teacher, along with classroom teachers and interventionists, work together to make sure 
there are no conflicts with the ENL schedule.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The ENL program consists of stand alone and integrated instructions that are designed to meet NYS Learning Standards for 
each grade, and is also tailored to address each student's individual language needs. The stand alone instruction is aligned with 
grade- level Literacy, Social Studies and Science curriculum.  The ENL teacher supports students with vocabulary and grammar 
development, along with reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills that are required to understand the topics being 
covered in both Social Studies and Science. Tools used to support this work include the use of a TV monitor, both fiction and 
non-fiction leveled books, big books that are used for shared reading, ipads, and language development games and 
puzzles.  The integrated instruction is aligned with the NYS Learning Standards for each grade level.  The ENL teacher focuses 
on balanced literacy, where shared, independent, and guided reading, as well as independent and shared writing are 
emphasized; along with additional scaffolds to support students' language development. Tools used for this work include 
differentiated writing paper, both fiction and non-fiction leveled texts, as well as the use of word banks, sentence strips, 
highlighter tape, wiki stix, realia when appropriate, and ipads.  All instruction is in English, but many classroom teachers use 
online translators when appropriate to assist students with comprehension. Additionally, students are encouraged to spend 
some of the classroom time reading, writing, or speaking in their native language around a content area that the class is 
studying, when necessary and appropriate.  Also, additional integrated instruction and small-group support in language arts 
and math is provided by the ENL teacher, intervention teachers, and other personnel with expertise in English language 
arts.  These ENL instructions and practices are designed to aligned with the NYS Learning standards and foster ELL students to 
become lifelong readers and writers.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   When appropriate, we use bilingual staff members and volunteers, including student teachers and America Reads volunteers, 
to assist with evaluating students in their home languages.  Additionally, when students are evaluated for SETSS or speech 
services, we request a bilingual evaluation for the student.  If any standardized exam is available in a student's native language, 
that translated exam is ordered as an option for the student unless the parent requests the child be evaluated in English as the 
dominant academic language.  Students can access books in their home language from the library as well as online resources 
using ipad so that ENL teacher can evaluate their home language. In addition, ENL teacher interviews the parents for student 
home language proficiency.  ELL students are also paired with peers who speak the same native language to assess their home 
language.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) PS158 has never had any SIFE students, so no SIFE program model is used. If a SIFE student were to register, the student 
would be age-appropriately placed in a classroom. Then that student would be served individually to suit literacy needs, using 
relevant scaffolding techniques. 
 
b) All of our ELL students right now are considered newcomers.  The classroom teachers and the ENL teacher work together to 
determine the students' strengths and weaknesses, and how we can differentiate the classroom instruction for them. The 
students are paired and grouped with more proficient readers and speakers of English. Both the classroom teacher and the 
ENL teacher also make use of visuals and graphic organizers in order to support students' understanding of classroom tasks 
and content. These students also receive instruction in pull- out ENL around vocabulary and language development that 
supports their understanding of classroom content in order to support them in their classroom work. Students also receive 
testing accommodations on formal assessments and state tests.  Examples of accommodations include the use of bilingual 
dictionaries, a small group setting and extended time.  
  
c) We currently have only 1 developing ELL. (students that have been receiving instruction for 4 years).  His instruction includes 
an emphasis on reading comprehension and writing organization and conventions. This student also receives testing 
accommodations on formal assessments and state tests. Examples of accommodations include the use of bilingual 
dictionaries, and extended time.  
  
d) We do not have any Long-Term ELLs, and given that our school is K-5, we would only have a long- term ELL if a student 
repeated a grade.  However, if we did have a Long- Term ELL in the future, we would do an intensive study of their NYSESLAT 
and assessment scores in order to determine an area of weakness and design instruction to target that area. Students would 
also receive testing accommodations on formal assessments and state tests. Examples of accommodations include the use of 
bilingual dictionaries, and extended time.  
  
e. The ENL teacher includes Former ELL students in her grade- level groupings and provides integrated ENL instruction 90 
minutes a week.  Additionally, the ENL teacher works collaboratively with the classroom teacher to determine any areas of 
weakness and to help provide scaffolds that best support that student's needs.  Former ELLs are also provided ELL exam 
accommodations on standardized tests, including the use of bilingual dictionaries and extended time. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
The ENL teacher meets with all service providers for those students and is aware of all necessary accommodations. The ENL 
teacher and the Special Education teachers and service providers meet regularly in order to discuss students' progress and to 
collaborate on scaffolds and supports for the student.  We also collaborate with the classroom teacher in order to plan 
appropriate instruction for students, based on their language level and IEP goals.  We also discuss tools and other strategies 
that can be used in the classroom in order to support students and ensure that they are understanding the material and able 
to perform classroom tasks independently. Some materials we have used to support students in this work include English 
language games on ipads, as well as English storytelling apps, which help students in their listening and oral language 
development. We also use age- appropriate board games and card games in order to support these students in mastering 
vocabulary as well as building sentences and using appropriate syntax and oral communication skills. Additionally, some 
students use an ipad with headphones to listen to books and stories that their classmates are reading independently, as well as 
laptops to help them write easier. These materials are determined grade and age- appropriate based on the skill that they 
target as well as students' interest in using the materials and ability to use them independently.  In order to build vocabulary 
skills, ENL teacher provides word cards with visuals, antonyms, synonyms and high-frequency words.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
We use curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility in order to best meet the diverse needs of the ELL- SWD's within the 
least restrictive environment.  When receiving ENL services, these students are grouped with students at similar age groups 
and similar language levels, that allow them to receive instruction that supports both their language development and IEP 
goals.  The ENL teacher works with the Special Education teachers and service providers to ensure that scheduling is done in a 
way that students are receiving ENL services as well as the mandates required by their IEPs.  Additionally, the ENL teacher 
works with the Special Education teachers and classroom teachers in order to discuss curriculum and instructional 
modifications that may be appropriate for students in order to best support them in attaining English proficiency but also 
achieve their IEP goals.  Students' language levels and proficiency in the four modalities is considered as well as the 
information from their IEP when making these decisions.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 Regular formal assessments as well as informal observations and anecdotal notes are used in all content areas in order to 
determine the effectiveness of instruction and the intervention program for all students. Additional at- risk intervention is also 
available for those who qualify.  Intervention services are offered to ELLs who need additional help in ELA, Math, Science or 
Social Studies. After school programs, small group instruction and customized lessons to meet their needs are some of the 
interventions offered. These interventions include targeted instruction in English, as well as the incorporation of materials and 
information in the native language, when necessary and appropriate. Saturday Academy and Test Prep are also available to our 
ELL population to help them prepare for the state tests.     
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our data indicates that ELL students need more support in their writing.  Therefore, ENL teacher will focus on students' 
academic writing skills.  Instruction will focus on using both fiction and non-fiction texts to improve on writing and grammar 
skills.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not applicable. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Information is sent home to ELL students about after school programs, and students are given the opportunity to enroll and 
participate in these programs.  After school programs focus on sports, technology, and visual arts.  Additionally, ELLs are given 
information about Saturday Academy and Intervention programs and are given the opportunity to participate.  Most ELLs 
participate in at least one after school program, or Saturday Academy.  Additionally, our Title III program is a Readers Theater 
program specifically for ELLs that meets before school. Students in all grades and of all ELL subgroups are invited to this 
program, and many do. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All of our students, including ELLs, have access to the media center. Instructional materials used by ELLs in their classrooms 
include books on tape, smart board technology, cameras to take pictures for meaningful language experiences, Ipads and 
computers. Web-based translation and English story telling apps are sued to support ELL students.  Additionally, students have 
access to native language books and articles as well as ipad and computer apps that support their native language 
development.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We give importance to honoring our ELLs’ native language and culture. In the ENL classroom each child is given the 
opportunity to share aspects of his/her culture whether it be through pictures, stories or celebrations. The ENL classroom 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

offers various materials such as: leveled books, non-fiction library, picture dictionaries, books on tape and CD, songs and 
chants and big books for shared reading. Classroom teachers also honor the cultural differences between their students by 
giving students the opportunity to share information about their native language and countries, and by giving students access 
to dictionaries and ipads that allow them to read and writing in their native language. Our school library offers a selection of 
books in Spanish, French and Japanese. Other books that discuss different cultures and languages are also available. Our ELLs 
also have access to computers as well as lessons in Music, Art and Science. Our parent coordinator is in charge of distributing 
information regarding any Citywide ELL Workshops. She makes sure that the information regarding the workshops is given to 
the parents in their native language. Our guidance counselor and school nurse also have information regarding their field in 
various languages available to the parents of our ELLs      
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 ELLs are grouped based on proficiency level and age.  Most often, students are taught in a grade level group that has students 
of various proficiency levels.  However, there are also groups of Entering and Emerging students that are getting stand alone 
instruction groups that consist of students in 2 contiguous grades. All resources are also age and grade level appropriate. Some 
of these resources include leveled books, books on tape, Big Books, poems and chants; as well as non fiction articles, grammar 
and vocabulary games as well as visual charts and tools. Through observation and assessment, we can determine which 
resources are best appropriate for which students, and design or find additional resources that support students' grade- level 
knowledge and language development.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We share our school building with Yorkville East Middle School.  ENL teachers from two schools collaborate in planning and 
share resources.   All of our students, including ELLs, have access to the media center, the gym and the science room. 
Instructional materials used by ELLs in their classroom include books on tape, smart board technology, cameras to take 
pictures for meaningful language experiences, Ipads and computers. Additionally, students have access to native language 
books and articles as well as ipad and computer apps that support their native language development.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All newly arrived children will receive extra help during the first 6 weeks of school to adjust to their new 
environment.  Whenever needed, ENL teacher meets with newly enrolled ELL students individually to provide check-in sessions 
to support smooth transition.  New ELL students will get support in familiarizing themselves through school tours.  The ENL 
teacher visits those students' classrooms regularly to observe students, and determine specific areas where they may require 
more support or particular interests or strengths they have.  She then works with the classroom teacher in order to 
differentiate the routines and classroom work at the beginning of the year to be appropriate for newcomers.  This includes 
using visuals in order to introduce routines and expectations, scaffolding the written language used in charts and instructions 
so that it is comprehensible for ELLs, and planning community building activities that allow newcomer ELLs to participate. The 
ENL teacher also works with parents in order to address any specific concerns or thoughts they might have about their child's 
language and social needs, and to make a plan together about how to best support the student for the first six weeks of 
school.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  
There are no language electives at this time. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

We don't have a dual language program at PS 158. 
 

 

 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teacher has the option of attending the literacy PD that classroom teachers attend in order to support her knowledge 
of the literacy standards and curriculum; as well as to offer support to teachers of ELLs.  She also receives an email newsletter 
from the Office of English Language Learners that lists PD opportunities for ELL educators in the region, and attends the 
sessions that seem most appropriate and beneficial.  Any information gained from these meetings is reported to staff, 
including teachers of ELLs and administration, guidance counselors and the parent coordinator, in order to ensure that 
necessary steps are taken to follow the compliance regulations.  The ENL teacher meets with colleagues, including other ENL 
teachers in District 2, for a monthly peer consultation group.  This group regularly discusses changes to compliance regulations, 
various teaching methodology, and testing information.  We also discuss any workshops and conventions that we have 
attended in an attempt to support each other with new instructional techniques and ELL compliance information. 
All teachers have been given copies of the NYS Learning Standards and the staff refers to the standards regularly when 
discussing curriculum planning and instruction.  The ENL teacher has access to curriculum guides for all grades K-5, which 
includes information about how the curriculum aligns to the NYS Learning Standards  and how to support students in 
mastering these standards. Additionally, the ENL teacher attends workshops and conferences throughout the year that 
support her knowledge of the NYS Learning Standards and how to support students with these standards. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We recognize the importance of training our teachers by offering them professional development opportunities that focus on 
the effective teaching of ENL strategies through the content area. All teachers work with curriculum staff developers in groups 
and individually to model best literacy practices, including how to best support ELLs with their literacy development.  In these 
workshops, they will address specific issues that teachers may encounter when working with English Language Learners.  Our 
Math Coach will work with new teachers and mentor teachers on each grade to address issues dealing with developing an 
understanding of math content knowledge and ENL strategies.  Our September staff development days included strategies for 
assessing all children, including ELLs, through conferencing and observations.   The ENL teacher also provides different  ENL 
instructional strategies with the staff and also disseminate information on translation services provided by NYCDOE.  In 
addition, teachers on the grade and across grades spend time analyzing assessments and planning for instruction.  The ENL 
teacher participates in these grade- level meetings in order to support teachers with analyzing ELL's assessments and 
determining appropriate next steps. She also works closely with other staff members addressing issues and concerns they may 
have regarding the ELLs they work with. 
 
Additionally, in order to be in compliance with the CR Part 154.2 requirements, General Ed teachers will be provided with 
professional development from an ENL certified teacher/PD provider. This will include workshops run by the ENL teacher that 
focus on the Second Language Acquisition continuum, supporting ELLs with literacy development, and using technology to 
support ELLs. These workshops will be conducted during PD time before or after school, and will be supplemented by sessions 
during our Professional Development time on Election Day in November and Chancellor's Day in June.  Additionally, the ENL 
teacher hosts "open office hours" where she is open to meet with classroom teachers about specific questions or concerns 
they might have regarding their ELL students.  During these meetings, she also provides teachers with resources that may 
assist them in understanding Second Language Acquisition and in scaffolds and supports for their students. Special Ed. 
teachers will be provided with PD in ENL strategies and theory, and will engage in discussions with the ENL teacher regarding

ways to support ELLS that are also SWD. The ENL teacher keeps a record of the number of times she meets with each 
classroom teacher, and what was discussed.  Additionally, all PD agendas and sign- in sheets are kept in the main office.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The ENL teacher reaches out to parents in January to arrange these meetings, either by making a phone call and using 
interpretation when necessary, or by sending a letter in the parent's native language.  At the meetings, she discusses students' 
language progress in all four modalities based on assessments, observations and classroom work.  She also references 
students' scores on the NYSESLAT or NYSITELL in order to show progress and areas where the student may continue to need 
support. She also includes information about the instruction that students have been receiving both in the pull- out setting and 
when pushing into the classroom.  She works with parents to set goals for students, and discusses how both she and the 
parents can support students in achieving these goals.  The DOE Interpretation services are used when necessary.  Sign- in 
sheets and letters inviting parents to these meetings are kept on file with the ENL teacher.  When arranging meetings, the ENL 
teacher works with the parents and the classroom teacher to ensure that parent needs are accommodated, including 
translation and any tools or handouts they may require.  If parents cannot attend a meeting, they are contacted by phone call, 
email, or written letter.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

A conference is conducted each Fall before Parent Teacher Conferences to orient ELL parents on program requirements, 
instructional standards, assessments to be implemented and school expectations. ELL parents are encouraged to meet with 
teachers regarding their child's performance at least three times each year, during parent teacher conferences in November 
and March as well as one additional time with the ENL teacher to discuss language progress. Translators are provided. Our 
parent coordinator will facilitate a series of parent outreach workshops that will be held throughout the school year to teach 
parents about school resources, policies and programs and to explain the NYS standards and assessments and the school's 
expectations regarding the students' attaining standards. We recognize the importance of the Home-School Connection for all 
students, including ELLs.  In order to foster ELL parent involvement, we hot international breakfast for ELL parents.   
In terms of parent involvement we provide the following activities: Principal Curriculum Chats, Family Mornings, Math Parent 
Workshops, Literacy Parent Workshops, monthly PA meetings and outreach by our ENL teacher.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dina Ercolano, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use the language preference requested on the HLIS, along with the Preferred Language Report from ATS and 
the information on blue cards in order to determine parents' language preferences. Classroom teachers also send 
home surveys at the beginning of the year asking parents about their children as well as language requests. 
Additionally, the ENL teacher asks parents for language preference requests when they sign in for the parent 
orientations in September. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We always have access to the blue cards during emergency drills, including fire drills and lockdown drills. In case of an 
emergency, we would use the blue cards to contact parents. For translation, we would use people in the building, and 
the translation and interpretation line. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

We distribute letters to all teachers at the beginning of the year that explains that parents are entitled to translation 
and how they can use the translation and interpretation line to provide this translation. We send reminder emails 
before Parent Teacher conferences to remind parents about using the Translation and Interpretation line during their 
conferences.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

The Welcome Poster will be hung at the entrance of the school. Parents will receive copies of the Parents' Bill of 
Rights and Parents' Guide to Language Access, in their native languages, at the beginning of the year. The Language ID 
Guide will be placed at the security desk and the main office to assist parents with identifying that they need 
translation.

Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents will receive the School Survey for Parents, which they can fill out in order to communicate if the school is able 
to communicate with them in their native language. Additionally, we are in the process of forming a small group of 
parents of various cultures and languages that can provide feedback about our translation and interpretation.
