Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our school mission statement sums up the holistic approach that we take: "Our school's mission is to be a school of 
excellence AND a school with a heart. Known for its academic achievement, Cardozo High School recognizes that a 
brilliant mind devoid of compassion is lacking the humanity that defines success. Therefore, we promote character by 
creating a community in which each individual is valued and respected. Central to our mission is the goal to design, 
implement and operate programs throughout the school reflective of the specific needs and unique challenges of our 
school community as defined by all its students (General and Instructional Support Services Students, ELL, at-risk and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

advanced) and faculty, staff, parents and the broader community at large. In all we do, we maintain high expectations 
for everyone!".  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Benjamin N. Cardozo High School is one of the largest and most successful comprehensive zoned high schools in New 
York City. Our school motto is "a school of excellence with a heart" and we work tirelessly to uphold the standards of 
academic excellence that define our school while ensuring that all students are taken care of from a holistic point of 
view.  

 

We have several programs that we are very proud of including the DaVinci Screened Math and Science Program which 
has an engineering strand and a biomedical strand, our educational option Institute of Political Science, Law and 
Ethics, our educational option Journalism and Media Studies Program, and our audition Dance Program. In addition to 
our application programs, we have a number of internal SLC programs for our Liberal Arts (zoned) students including, 
PLTW Computer Science, Criminal Justice, Theater Arts, Gateway and NJROTC. We provide all of our students with 
rigorous educational programs that provide choices that appeal to the varied learning styles of our large student 
body. The reasons for the school’s success are a reflection of the collaboration that exists between staff, students, 
parents, and all other strands of the school community. We always take a collaborative approach in our decision 
making process. 

 

Cardozo High School’s curriculum is rigorously aligned to the NYS next generation Standards. Our curriculum 
promotes higher order thinking skills. Teacher units and lessons utilize pedagogical tools such as Bloom’s taxonomy 
and Webb’s Depth of Knowledge to promote critical thinking and higher order thinking skills that will prepare the 
student for college and career readiness. Teacher teams develop unit and lesson plans that challenge students 
through increased document based writing where citation from the text becomes standard practice in a class. Math 
curriculum incorporates text and reading based activities that promote higher order thinking. Increased rigor is 
reflected in all disciplines and is expected from learners of all levels. Students engagement is promoted through 
lessons that create opportunities for student initiated tasks and inquiry. 

 

We hold all of our students, staff, and parents to high expectations. For instance, all students, regardless of 
achievement level are urged to take 4 years of math and science and to challenge themselves with extra years of 
foreign language. In addition, our advanced placement course programming follows our school’s philosophy that all 
students can learn. In a majority of the school’s AP courses, enrollment is open; Exposure to college level work is just 
as important as success on the Advanced Placement Exam in fostering college preparedness. Also, we offer College 
Now courses in collaboration with St. John's University, Adelphi University, and Queens College and have partnered 
with Queensborough Community College to offer additional courses there. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

We have a special needs population of nearly 570 students and an ELL population of approximately 200 students. We 
strive to differentiate instruction for all of our different learning types while maintaining the academic rigor that our 
school is known for. We utilize flexible programming for our students with disabilities and are currently expanding our 
ENL co-teaching program in an attempt to best support our ENL students. Our SWD population is comprised of 
students with academic delays, speech and language delays and social-emotional needs specific to their diagnoses. 
This year we have an increased number of students who fall on the Autism spectrum as well as a growing number of 
students who are classified for both ISS and ENL services. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

To address the rigorous instruction aspect of the Framework for Great Schools, various departments have been 
working closely within their teacher teams in rolling out rigorous writing and critical thinking components that satisfy 
the next generation standards in each class, while focusing on non-fiction texts. In addition, in the 2017-18 school 
year our ELA department fully adopted the use of Collections as a core curriculum. Departments in all disciplines have 
incorporated argumentative writing into their curriculum, and are an expectation of the class. As part of our school’s 
instructional focus, we are emphasizing student engagement; therefore, our teacher teams are creating activities that 
involve all students, and offer a wide array of tasks so that students have the chance to fully understand the lesson. 

 

Additionally, with the approval of a School Based Option for the 17-18 and 18-19 school years, we have been able to 
foster an environment of collaboration for teachers in line with the Framework for Great Schools by creating common 
planning time for our teachers. This has allowed them the time needed to further develop curriculum, analyze key 
data trends, and reach out to all strands of the Cardozo HS community. This SBO has also allowed us to build 
additional time in for community and family engagement aligned to the Strong Familiy-Community ties portion of the 
framework which was an area identified as needing improvement on our school environment survey. This year we are 
continuing to expand the use of the SKEDULA program to promote increased parental awareness of student progress.  

 

Key areas of focus for the 2018-19 school year continue to align with the rigorous instruction, collaborative teachers, 
and strong family-community ties portions of the Framework for Great Schools.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. The school's strengths relative to this framework element are that with approximately 200 teachers, there are 
many examples of rigorous instructional activities and deep thoughtful discussions filled with critical thinking taking 
place. We will be utilizing our internal strengths to model best practices as we move toward a more consistent, 
uniform understanding and delivery of rigorous and engaging instruction. Cardozo's exceptionally high rates for 
attendance, graduation, credit accumulation, college placement and applications to enter the school all evidence its 
success to date as evident in the School Quality Snapshot and NYSED School Report Card. In addition, during the 
2018-19 school year Cardozo High School will be participating in a Sustainable Professional Learning Pilot program 
with the Queens North BFSC which will target the areas of rigorous instructional planning and implementation. 

2. Analysis of in-class observations, lesson plan review, Quality Review documentation, and dialogue among 
administration, faculty, students, and parents indicate need for increased rigor in classrooms as well as in increase 
in activities that promote student engagement. With emphasis on the incorporation of next generation standards, 
additional research and development for ongoing growth amongst all learning populations - especially SWDs and 
ELLs - in conjunction with dialogue among all stakeholders is essential. Feedback from 2017-18 PPO visits showed 
inconsistencies in the level of rigor observed during classroom lessons and indicated a need to increase levels of 
student engagement as well as normalize standards for assessment and grading across disciplines.  

Specific data points indicating need: 

PPO/QR 2017-18: Indicators 1.1 and 1.2 listed as school area of focus 

LES: 57% of students feel challenged in their classes (below Borough and City averages) 

MOTP averages: 1E - 2.8, 3B - 2.8, 3C - 2.8, 3D - 2.8 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

Throughout the 2018 to 2019 academic year, Benjamin N. Cardozo High School will focus on purposeful planning 
across content areas with an emphasis on increasing classroom rigor and building student capacity to independently 
succeed with challenging academic tasks. This will be evidenced by the LCI’s Evaluative Checklist of Academic Rigor, 
student responses regarding rigorous instruction in the learning environment survey, student achievement rates and 
mastery at the end of the year, and rating data from the PPO or QR 1.1, 1.2.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. Most recent Quality Review rated us “Proficient” in this category. School attendance rates are generally between 
93 and 95%. The school supports nearly 70 student run clubs and 36 PSAL teams so that students can embrace the 
complete high school experience. 

2. There is an overall need to increase supports and differentiation for all students with an increased emphasis on 
SWD and ENL student performance. This is evident by the achievement gap that exists between these sub-groups 
and the rest of the student population as indicated in our NYSED report card and accountability report. In addition 
there is a need to better prepare students from these subgroups with post-secondary readiness. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Cardozo High School seeks to expand post-secondary readiness among ELL and SWD subgroup students . During the 
2018-19 school year, Cardozo High School will host a minimum of two transition nights for students who may be 
taking non-traditional post-secondary paths. In addition, Cardozo High School will participate in the College Access for 
All program, MBK, as well as the Lead Higher Initiative to close the opportunity gap by 25% for 10th and 11th graders 
in underrepresented subgroup populations who are interested in taking advanced level coursework.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. According to the NYC Quality Guide for 2017-18, teachers feel that they collaborate well with one another on 
instructional programs and 86% of teachers feel that they make a conscious effort to coordinate their instruction 
across grade levels. In support of maintaining and raising these statistics, Cardozo High School has adopted an SBO for 
the 2018-19 school year which allows for teacher teams to meet on three professional periods every week. In 
addition, the SBO schedule allocates up to three mornings per month for teacher led professional learning. During the 
2018-19 school year Cardozo High School was chosen to be the pilot high school for the Queens North BFSC 
Sustainable professional Learning Pilot program. In addition to the in-house professional learning opportunities, 
Cardozo High School led Queens North last year in teachers leaving the building to attend PL series events facilitated 
by FSC support specialists and those teachers turn-keyed their workshops at department meetings. This practice will 
continue during the 2018-19 school year. 

2. While there has been increased focus on PL and teacher teams over the last two school years, the processes for 
collaborative professional learning are rudimentary in their current structure. We have basic systems in place for 
teacher team work but coherence is lacking both within and across disciplines. There is a need for teachers to have a 
time and place to conduct their own needs assessments which will help to drive the PL and inquiry work and once the 
need is identified there is facilitation/coaching required to plan and deliver professional learning. PPO feedback 
indicates a need for teacher teams to begin to evaluate the quality of learning tasks embedded in unit and lesson 
plans to ensure that there is a shared understanding of rigor and differentiation across the school. In order to achieve 
this, inquiry and PL cycles will have to be formally established to facilitate these conversations and drive pedagogical 
changes. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
During the 2018-19 school year Cardozo High School will plan and implement improved structures for teacher team 
inquiry and professional development. We will expand the organization of teacher teams to allow for increased focus on 
cross-curricular coherence, differentiation, common planning, professional development and student engagement. 
During the 2018-19 school year Cardozo High School will plan and implement a Professional Learning Committee which 
will be comprised of administrators and lead teachers. The committee will receive training on how to successfully plan 
and facilitate professional learning sessions and the result will be a minimum of 3 cycles of teacher-led professional 
learning for each content area per each semester.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
During the 2018-19 school year teacher teams will be conducting inquiry cycles to address student achievement in 
identified high leverage areas such as credit accumulation for bottom 1/3 students, Algebra I passing rates for SWD 
and ELA regents passing rates for ENL expanding students. The teacher teams will be coming up with strategies to 
improve student achievement which in most cases will only be successful with a strong teacher-parent connection. 
Teachers and guidance counselors will be providing progress reports to parents throughout the school year as well as 
regularly updating pupil path with both grade data as well as anecdotal data so that families will have an ongoing 
understanding of their student's progress. The oversight of this will be from the department administrators and the 
lead teachers that are facilitating the inquiry groups.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. The latest PPO indicated an area of celebration where "The principal continues to ensure that student program 
groupings and interventions, including those for ELLs and SWDs, is developing to support access to learning 
opportunities that lead to college and career readiness." 

2. The most recent Quality Review showed inconsistency in the level of rigor observed during classroom lessons. In 
addition the latest PPO report indicated that "Curricula and academic tasks continue to inconsistently emphasize 
rigorous habits and higher order skills across grades, subjects, and/or for English Language Learners (ELLs) and 
students with disabilities (SWDs)." and "Across the five classrooms that were visited student work products and 
discussions continue to reflect uneven levels of student cognitive engagement and participation. Questioning and 
other scaffolds were not consistently utilized to provide multiple entry points so that all learners are engaged in 
challenging learning tasks. Observed trends across classrooms continue to include a lack of opportunity for students 
to participate in high level student-to-student discussions, low level questions being posed to students, and pacing 
that left little or no time for students to take ownership over their work or engage in metacognition." 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019 Cardozo High School administrators and lead teachers will participate in a minimum of four professional 
learning walks/classroom visits, in order to ensure administrative calibration, support building leaders on their 
implementation of the Danielson Framework, gauge the progress of PL sessions, and also as an additional means of 
providing accurate and specific feedback of instructional trends, areas of celebration, areas of focus and actionable next 
steps to teachers and APs focusing on 1E and Domain 3.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Our most recent School Quality Guide indicates that over 90% of parents feel that the Principal and the teachers 
respect them and that they trust the teachers and the Principal. Over 90% of families say that teachers are responsive 
to them and that they are satisfied with the education that their child receives. 

2. We recognize that strong partnerships between schools and families is essential to the academic success of our 
students. It is well documented that there is an overall decline in parent involvement in high school and this is evident 
in conversations and meetings that take place across our school. Extensive discussions among the SLT, PTA Executive 
Board and the faculty point to a desire for increased direct parent involvement in school as well as increased 
accessibility of student data to parents on a daily basis. The School Quality Guide indicates that there is a disconnect 
between the teachers' feeling of close work with families and the parents indicating that only 43% of parents say that 
they have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their child's school. 

 

  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019 Cardozo High School will define and implement strategies to increase the level of parent involvement to 
better support students' goals and overall achievement. During the 2017-18 school year parent attendance at PTA 
meetings was approximately 25 parents on average per month. By the end of the 2018-19 school year we hope to be at 
50 parents on average per month. Other measures of parent participation will include attendance at PTA meetings, 
attendance at SLT meetings, attendance at school events and parent initiated communication between parents and 
staff.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Benjamin N. Cardozo High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title 
I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 
Benjamin N. Cardozo High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act. 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Our ELL students face challenges in academic language and content, especially in ELA, Global 
and US History. Based on our data obtained from Regents exams, Student Evaluation Report by 
School (RESI), NYESLAT History (RLAT) Report, Revised Lab\NYSESLAT (RLER) Report 
and ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT), our ELLs struggle in reading and writing content rich 
texts. 86 of our ELLs scored below 65 on the 2017-2018 ELA Regents; 40 scored below 65 on 
the 2017-18 Global History Regents; and 14 scored below 65 on the 2017-18 US History 
Regents. The EDAT data indicates that around 43% (79 out of 184 NYSESLAT test takers) 
remained at the same ENL proficiency level on the 2017 NYSESLAT.  The majority of these 
students were on the Expanding level. For our Title III Supplemental Program, we identified two 
groups of students – EM to TR Newcomers (37 students from 9th - 11th grade) and EX ELLs (54 
students from 9th – 12th grade) who remained at the same proficiency level on the NYSESLAT.  
The Title III before- and after-school programs will offer supplemental instructions in ELA and 
social studies to identified ENL students in grades 9-12. The after-school program will run from 
Mondays to Thursdays during November - December 2018 and April - June 2019. Classes will 
be scheduled from 3:05 to 5:05 and will be focused on preparing students for the January/June 
Regents exams and the NYSESLAT in May. The classes will be conducted by dually licensed 
ENL and content area teachers (Ms. Brathwaite – ENL/ELA, Ms. Efkarpides – ENL/ELA, Mr. 
Dunn -ENL/SS and Ms. Choi Shin – ENL/SS). Classes will be conducted in English to speakers 
of all languages.  The teachers will follow New York State Bilingual Common Core Initiative 
provided by EngageNY (https://www.engageny.org/resource/new-york-state-bilingual-common-
core-initiative). 
The before-school program will be run from 7:00 to 7:55 for newcomers on the entering, 
emerging, and transitioning levels. According the FSF ELL Student Report (RFSF), 37 out of 
our 180 ELLs are newcomers who are at the EN, EM, or TR level.  Classes will be offered to 
these students twice a week before school. This program, taught by a certified ENL teacher, aims 
to enrich their reading and analyzing various types of literature and non-fiction texts, develop 
their analytical and writing skills, and enhance more cultural excursion.  
The after-school program will be offered to ELLs from entering to expanding levels. There will 
be four groups of ELLs: 9th -10th grade EN – TR ELLs, 11th – 12th grade EN – TR ELLs, 9th – 
10th grade EX ELLs and 11th – 12th grade EX ELLs. All students will be provided instructions 
to enhance their conversational and academic English, as well as content knowledge. Classes 
taught by ENL certified teacher focus on literacy skills while classes taught by dually licensed 
teachers focus on both academic language, literacy and content knowledge.  
Materials to be purchased are as follows: 
* Regents Preparation books for English, Global, and U.S. History 
*iPads for newcomer students for translating and communicating in classes

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  
We offer two types of professional development to our Cardozo staff. One is held for ELA and 
ENL teachers on Friday mornings from 8:15 - 8:43 and is facilitated by Danielle Krawec, an 
ENL/ELA certified teacher.  These professional developments are focused on differentiating 
instruction for ELLs and FELLs depending on their language proficiency and learning 
style.  Another is held after school by our ENL Coordinator Ashley Breen, who sets the agenda 
for each meeting based on updated data and information about the ELLs in our school.  ENL 
teachers are encouraged to share concerns as well as best practices during these meetings. 
Throughout this academic year, Ashley Breen provides study group sessions for our ENL and 
their content-area co-teachers. She supports our staff in implementing an empirically validated 
framework for teaching both academic content and language skills for our ELLs. Here she 
promotes understanding of specific considerations for and help prepare them to become college 
and career ready. The teachers will meet three times throughout the year. The workshops will be 
held in the spring semester in order to develop strategies for preparing ELLs for college and the 
upcoming school year. 
Topics that being discussed are: 
a. Analyzing ELLs Data to scaffold instructions 
b. Effective co-teaching practice 
c. Setting language and content goals in integrated classes 
d. Literacy strategies 
e. Creating culturally responsive classroom environments 
Additionally, professional development is offered by our ENL coordinator Mrs. Breen to 
licensed ENL staff. Teachers meet in the morning for 43 minutes before school throughout the 
year. One of our goals is to effectively use our ELL data to scaffold instructions, 
differentiate tasks and assessments. In addition, participants investigate strategies to enhance the 
academic language in all content-area subjects of our ELLs. We also train our ENL teachers to 
be familiar with the CR Part 154 Regulations, the New York State Bilingual Common Core 
Initiative, the Target of Measurement for ELLs, and ENL related state exams.   
Records of the professional developments are maintained through agendas and attendance 
sheets.  
 
 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   

  how parents will be notified of these activities 

Begin description here:            
 
Based on survey results conducted during 2017-2018 school year class, parents responded that 
they would like to be more involved  in their children's education and success in 
school.  Therefore, parents need appropriate support in getting to know more about the 
graduation requirements, school system in New York City, and education system and policy in 
the United States. They also requested ENL classes for parents and adults in our community. 
Our school will provide two parent nights and parent workshops throughout the year. Translators 
will be available for all parental engagement activities. Parents will be notified by mail (an 
invitation in their preferred language), phone calls and texts. Records are maintained through 
agendas and attendance sheets.  
1. Two Parent Nights 
a. Guidance counselor (TBD), ENL teachers/translators (Ms. Krawec, Mr. Feliz, Ms. Liang and 
Ms. Choi-Shin) and the ENL AP (Ms. Kierez) will meet with parents of ELLs to discuss their 
inquiries and concerns about their children’s ENL program. Facilitators will also focus on 
graduation requirements, the Regents exam requirements, SAT/ACT prep, transcripts, college 
essays, college applications, and FAFSA. The workshop will be held on November 29, 2018 
from 4:30-5:00.  
b. The ENL coordinator (Mrs. Breen) and the ENL AP (Mrs. Kierez) will hold a parent night on 
March 7, 2019 (4:30-5:00) to address the NYSESLAT. This meeting aims to enhance the 
awareness and understanding of the upcoming NYSESLAT. Facilitators will discuss the specific 
language skills that parents should be aware of and the types of activities or exercises that 
parents can practice with their children at home. Text preparation materials and a list of 
resources will be given to parents. 
 
2. Parent Workshops 
A parent adult ENL class will be held once a week (9:00-12:00) on Saturday from January to 
March to promote parental engagement and community outreach. The class will be facilitated by 
one certified ENL teacher (TBD) and the ENL AP (Ms. Kierez). Activities during the workshop 
focus on enhancing English proficiency and assisting parents with adapting to their new home.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Formative assessments, including Anecdotal, Running Records, Portfolio Assessment, Unit Assessment/ Project, are used to 
guide instructional planning for our ELLs in our standalone ENL classes. In all inter-graded ENL classes, ELLs are assessed via 
Anecdotal, Portfolio Assessment, and Unit Assessment/ Project.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We ensure that professional developments and trainings are provided for teachers of ELLs to understand how to utilize these 
assessments and how to use the assessment data to scaffold their instructions. In addition, evidence of the use of assessment 
data is reflected in teachers’ unit and lesson plans.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Summative assessments, including Fall/Spring ELL Periodic Assessments, and Content-Specific (ELA, Science, US History, Global 
History and Government) Baseline and Term Assessment, are administered to our ELLs. Via item analysis, we identify baseline, 
progress and areas of needs of or ELLs.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, teachers form professional groups to carry out item analysis. Via this procedure, 
they look at trends and identify the strengths and areas of needs of our ELLs. As teachers continue to collaborate, they discuss 
strategies to address ELLs’ skills deficiencies and modify their instruction based on the analysis results.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our school uses outcome assessments data from the NYSESLAT and the Regents (ELA/ Living Environment/ US History and 
Global History) to evaluate and inform our ELL programs. Periodically we use the EDAT to merge the RNMR, RIAT and RESI 
reports for updated passing rates on Regents exams, exam data and analysis for our ELL population. 
Through the EDAT, we identify different subgroups, such as SIFE, Long-Term ELLs, ELLs and FELLs with high at-risk levels. 
In addition, we look into how our ELLs are performing in the four modalities to find the strengths and weaknesses of the 
overall population. Data shows that Listening and Reading are the two areas in which our ELLs perform mediocre. There was a 
higher percentage of ELLs who scored medium than high in these modalities in the 2015-2016 NYSESLAT.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

These findings are presented to all teachers and guidance counselors of ELLs through faculty meetings and professional 
developments. In addition, our ENL teachers continuously use these findings to assist their content co-teachers in planning 
instructions, tasks and assessments.  This is to ensure that content co-teachers are often aware of the needs of ELLs and reflect 
on their pedagogues.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our school has a Freestanding ESL program for ELLs from 9-12 grades. As per CR Part 154.2, we implement both 
integrated and standalone ENL models. For ELA, Science, Math, US and Global History classes, integrated ENL services 
are provided by either a dually certified teacher or a licensed ENL teacher with a certified content area teacher. For 
ELL-SWDs, they receive their ENL service in a classroom with teachers who are certified in ENL, special education and 
content-area subject. ELLs who have mandated standalone ENL service are grouped homogeneous between two 
consecutive grade levels. This is to ensure the gap between grade level learning standard is minimal. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Before September, guidance counselors are given a report of proficiency levels of the ENL students in their caseloads. When 
we have a new immigrant ELL, our ENL coordinator informs the guidance counselor the students’ proficiency level obtained via 
the NYSITELL for appropriate placement. For an ELL who is transferred from a NYS public school, our ENL coordinator will send 
a request to obtain the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT result from that school. Then, she will inform the guidance counselor the 
proficiency level of that student. 
Our school meets CR Part 154 time allotments for ELLs through effective proficiency level clustering. Entering ELLs are 
provided with at least three units of study (560 minutes) of ENL instruction per week, including one unit of standalone ENL, 
one unit of integrated ENL/ELA and one unit of integrated ENL/content-area subject; Emerging ELLs receive at least two units 
of study (360 minutes), including one unit of standalone ENL and one unit of integrated ENL/ELA. Transitioning ELLs, expanding 
ELLs and Commanding ELLs are provided with at least one unit of ENL service (180 minutes) per week in an integrated ENL/ELA 
class or ENL/content-area class. Our Transitional ELLs are also provided with a standalone ENL class to receive extra support 
for their language acquisition. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In order to prepare students to meet the demands of CCLS in all content-area subjects, our dually certified ENL teachers, ENL 
teachers and their co-teachers attend professional developments to study ENL strategies, differentiated instructions and 
discuss how to implement them in their classes. 
Furthermore, our ENL teachers collaborate with content-area teachers to supplement ENL strategies in their ENL/content-area 
classes. Contextual support is important and comes through peer interaction, visual aids, maps, charts, graphic organizers, and 
manipulatives. Academic language development is also emphasized within each lesson to ensure ELLs' exposure of academic 
language and vocabulary. Moreover, ENL methodologies (i.e. repetition, visuals, and linguistic frames) are used to foster 
achievement of these academic language goals. Last but not least, many of our ENL teachers who are multilingual assist our 
ELLs through their native language. These teachers use students’ native language to assess their content knowledge, foster 
their higher-order thinking, explain and clarify concepts.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs and their parents determine the foreign language (Chinese, Korean, Spanish, German and French) that they will take in 
our school. The majority of our ELLs pick their native language as their foreign language course. Foreign language teachers 
assess them via class work, homework assignments, formative and summative assessments. Students are tested in their native 
languages in January and June when they take Regents examinations.   
    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
a.   Our SIFE students will be mandated to attend tutoring per their programs. Our plan includes intensive work with either an 
ARISTA tutor or specific subject area teacher tutors who are required tutoring as their D1 assignment. The students will be 
closely monitored under the supervision of their classroom teacher, to bring them up to grade level. Since all SIFE ELLs are 
either in EN or EM level, they are programmed for a standalone ENL class that targets on their English skills. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

b. Newcomers are assigned buddies in class under the supervision of a classroom teacher.  These students are recommended 
to attend tutoring both in our tutoring center with ARISTA tutors and teachers who work in the tutoring center for their 
professional activity.  These students receive a mandated course in reading and writing to improve their skills through their 
ENL/English class. 
c.   Developing ELLs are assigned buddies in class under the supervision of a classroom teacher.  Tutoring is also available in our 
tutoring center with ARISTA tutors and teachers who work in the tutoring center for their professional activity.  These students 
receive an additional writing class through the English department to improve the four modalities of English acquisition. 
d. Long term ELLs get intensive practice in the four modalities with extended emphasis in reading and writing.  A portion of 
these students are ELL-SWDs. Thus, the ENL department collaborates with the special education department to set language 
goals on the IEPs of these students. Also, we offer integrated Special Education/ENL content classes that target the language 
and academic challenges of these students. Long term ELLs also use a computerized program (Achieve 3000) to improve their 
Lexile level. Also, we offer Writers Studio classes for them to strength their academic English skills. 
e. All teachers of F-ELLs are notified of their students’ ENL status and their NYSESLAT results. These students are placed in at 
least one ENL/Content-area classes. In those classes, our ENL teachers differentiate teaching and learning tasks for our FELLs 
from their ELL peers. ENL teachers use the Common Core Literacy Standards to assess our FELLs instead of the NYSESLAT TOMs 
we use to assess our ELLs. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At our school, all ELL-SWDs receive mandated number of minutes of ENL instructions. These students are placed in classrooms 
and ENL groups that have a small student-to-teacher ratio so that the teachers can cater to ELLs' diverse needs more 
efficiently. Our ENL teachers work collaboratively with special education teachers to analyze students’ data and their IEPs, plan 
for appropriate instructions, as well as differentiate teaching and learning materials. Teachers of ELL-SWDs utilize 
differentiated instructional techniques for class and homework assignments to help students succeed. Teachers utilize 
Smartboards and auditory and visual stimuli rather than rely on textbooks alone during lessons.  SIOP strategies are employed 
using level appropriate content, Tier II & III vocabulary, TPR, appropriate standards, opportunities for interactions, etc.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL-SWDs are placed in as many mainstream classes as possible.  ALL ELL-SWDs are encouraged to join school clubs and are 
afforded after school tutoring with an ENL teacher.  They are also placed in collaborative classes, in accordance with their 
IEPs.   Our ENL teachers also take part in IEP meetings in order to have a thorough understanding of the needs of ELL-SWDs, 
and to ensure that language components, and goals are addressed in their IEPs. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Students attend our Tutoring Center and work with an ENL teacher in ELA or with a content area teacher. We also provide 
Achieve 3000 to our low level readers and additional writing classes to our freshman and sophomores. Though the medium of 
instruction is in English, native language support from bilingual teachers serves as an instructional scaffold to facilitate teaching 
and learning.  ELLs who score between a 60-74 on the ELA Regents are allowed to take the QCC College focus class for 
additional help. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year, our freshman and sophomore ENL/ELA classes are using HMH Collections – a DOE approved ELA 
curriculum. Collections allows our ENL teacher to align their ENL/ELA classes with the general education ELA classes. Thus, our 
ELLs are learning ELA via a mainstreamed curriculum with differentiated instructions, learning tasks and assessments. We want 
to ensure that once our ELLs become FELLs or join the mainstream ELA classes, they will have a seamless transition. 
In addition, our ENL department works closely with the guidance department to place ELLs and FELLs in appropriate ENL 
standalone and ENL/content-area classes. In order to provide a lower teacher-to-student ratio in the integrated ENL classes, 
we recommend guidance counselors to only put ELLs and FELLs who need these classes to get ready for their Regents. ELLs and 
FELLs who have passed certain subjects in their Regents will be put in a non-ENL mainstream class for those subjects. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Meanwhile, we will ensure that these students receive their mandated ENL minutes in the area of needs. 
Furthermore, we will use different assessment tools to keep track of our EN to TR ELLs’ reading levels. Assessment tools 
include Empower3000 and Running Records. These assessment tools allow our teachers to track students’ progress in literacy 
and target specific literacy skills they might need. Hence, teachers can modify their lessons based on the needs of their ELLs. 
Moreover, ELA Regents will be administered in sophomore year in order to provide our ELLs a safety net and additional 
practice for a public exam. All EN to TR ELLs will take the Fall and Spring ELL Periodic Assessments, provided by NYC SchoolNet. 
The assessment results allow our teachers to better modify their instructions by understanding the strengths and weaknesses 
of their ELLs’ English acquisition.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

NA 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Title III monies are used to provide supplemental services in the form of after school skills tutoring, which is provided by ESL 
licensed pedagogues. ELLs also have access to all after school activities, including clubs and athletic teams.  They also take 
advantage of after school tutoring, which is provided by our ARISTA students.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All ENL standalone and integrated classrooms are equipped with Smartboard technology. Our new ELA curriculum Collections 
provides us with digital version of the textbook, materials, and assessments in which a variety of visual and audio supports are 
integrated. In addition, we offer Castle Learning for ELLs in all grades and Empower 3000 to our 9th to 10th grade ELLs for their 
academic and language developments. We also have E-books with literature and nonfictional content-related (science and 
social studies) materials for our ELLs with limited English proficiency. Students can access these reading materials via a website 
or Kindles purchased for our ENL department. Moreover, we provide EN and EM ELLs with non fictional books that are of lower 
reading levels as well as graphic novels for ELA and Social Studies. These books help scaffold their background knowledge of 
content-area subjects. Lastly, glossaries, dictionaries and translation tools are accessible in all our ENL content-area 
classes. ELLs and FELLs are recommended to use them throughout the whole school year as to be familiar with the Tier II & III 
terms before their Regents. Last but not least, we have an ELL section in our school library. Apart from fictions and nonfictions 
in other languages, we also provide ELLs with English books that are of high interest yet of lower reading levels.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Our school currently provides a Freestanding ENL Program, and native language support is provided when necessary. Many of 
our ENL teachers are bi- or multi-lingual who can support our ELLs via their home language. Also, under the supervision of our 
teachers, ELLs work with Teaching Assistants who are fluent in our predominant native languages (Chinese and Spanish, 
etc.).  As to learning materials, an ENL library is dedicated to native language books in a multitude of genres and levels. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our ENL coordinator works closely with all guidance counselors to ensure that our ELLs and FELLs have the mandated ENL 
service in the classes that are of their age and grade levels. ELLs are grouped between two consecutive levels in our standalone 
ENL classes to ensure the lessons are appropriate for the age and grade level. Classroom and content-area teachers are 
provided with data (e.g. Lexile Reading level, NYSESLAT result, and anecdotal records) about their upcoming ELLs before the 
beginning of the year, so they can supplement their lessons with resources that their ELLs might need. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

Our ENL coordinator along with our parent coordinator provides orientation to the families of all newly enrolled ELLs before 
the beginning of the school year.  The parents of ELLs receive invitations in their native languages. In order to provide 
interpretation, parents and ELLs who speak the same language will be grouped together. During the orientation, parents and 
ELLs are provided information about the ENL program in our school, our school mission and the graduation 
requirements.  Moreover, a bilingual student helper will give a school tour for our new ELLs so they can be familiar with our 
school.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Students are encouraged to take a foreign language in order to prepare for college.  Our school offer Chinese, French, German, 
Korean, Sign Language and Spanish courses. Students may avail themselves to the level of language that meets their needs, 
including Advanced Placement.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
All school personnel, including all teachers and non-pedagogic staff, is provided with five 30-minutes professional 
development focusing on instruction and assessment for ELLs throughout the whole year. These professional developments 
are mandated. 
ENL teachers and their co-teachers are required to attend an additional three full-day professional development that targets 
collaboration in ENL classrooms. These professional developments are provided by NYU’s New York Statewide Language 
RBERN (The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development). 
In addition to the above professional developments, all ENL teachers attend four ENL department meetings throughout the 
year to analyze data of ELLs, share teaching practice and develop curriculum, instruction and assessment for ENL classes.  Our 
ENL coordinator attends three to four full-day training sessions offered by the DOE in which she learns the Nuts and Bolts of 
ENL program, how to use EDAT for data analysis and is trained for the NYSESLAT administration. She then turn-keys to crucial 
information to our ENL stuff during the ENL department meetings.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All teachers are mandated to attend five 30-minutes faculty conferences in which they receive ELL-specific professional 
development.  This is 42% (five out of twelve conferences) of their in-house professional development hours. Teachers of ELLs 
(non ENL licensed teachers) receive more than 42% as they attend three full-day training with their ENL co-teachers. All our 
ENL licensed teachers also attend the three full-day training, in additional to four 30-minutes ENL department meetings. The 
total ELL related professional development for them exceeds 50% of the total hours. 
Records, such as agendas, attendance and materials, are kept in the ENL Assistance Principal’s office for easy access.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our ENL coordinator has office hours (2 hours and 20 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the afternoon) that are 
opened to all ELL parents/guardians by appointment only.  In addition, our ENL teachers schedule and meet with parents/ 
guardians on Tuesdays and Wednesdays during their professional development time (from 1:46pm-2:15pm or 2:34pm-
3:02pm). Our department keeps a record of all the individual meetings that are held between our ENL teachers and parents. 
This is to ensure that every parent/guardian of ELLs meets with their child’s ENL provider to discuss academic and language 
acquisition goals and address concerns. Our bi- and multi-lingual ENL teachers either provide interpretation themselves, 
schedule an interpreter or use the DOE phone interpretation service when meeting with parents/guardians who have limited 
English proficiency.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Before each Parent-Teacher Conference, our ENL coordinator sends out mass emails, texts and makes phone calls in the 
preferred language of the parents/guardians to advise them to come and meet with our teachers. In addition, we hold monthly 
PTA meetings within our school and encourage parents/guardians of ELLs to attend. During the PTA meetings, interpretation is 
provided via stuff or DOE phone interpretation service. Moreover, we help parents/guardians sign up for Adult Education 
Classes throughout Queens by providing them the appropriate information given to us by the Queens Adult Learning 
Center. Our school also provides Adult ENL Classes for parents to learn English. The classes are held in during the week and on 
Saturdays. These classes are taught by our licensed ENL teachers. Last but not least, our department and the guidance 
department hold parent workshops to discuss academic, social and psychological developments of immigrant students. We 
provide information in regards to outside school classes, resources and community services which help parents/guardians and 
ELLs transition to the new country.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Meagan Colby, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use the Home Language Aggregation Report (RHLA) to ascertain the names of the parents that need 
translation services. We also determine translation needs during Open-School week, and through review of the 
HLIS surveys, student emergency contact cards. For students who are new to the NYS public school system, our 
trained pedagogue who administer the HLIS interviews parents/ guardians face-to-face to fill out their preferred 
language for written and oral communication. As to students who are transferred from a NYS public school, we 
assess language preferences of their parents through the emergency contact card and HLIS from their previous 
schools.

At the beginning of the school year, a professional development is held to ensure that our staff members are aware of 
the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663. During the professional development, staff members are provided with the 
regulation, and key elements are highlighted by our administrator. In addition, staff members are trained how to use 
the over-the-phone T&I service to contact parents who have limited English proficiency. Handout of important T&I 
related websites or Q&A will also be distributed.

Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school give out surveys twice a year during Parent-Teacher conferences to gather feedback from limited-English 
proficient parents on the language services they receive. Our feedback indicates that many limited-English proficient 
parents did not receive phone calls or only received English voicemails from our teachers in the previous years. Thus, 
our school provided a professional development in September, 2017 to train staff members to use the over-the-
phone interpretation service to contact parents during their parental engagement time.  

 

We will also set up an online survey in parents’ language that inquire their feedback on our T&I services, so we can 
improve our services.
