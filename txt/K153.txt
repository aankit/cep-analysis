Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our School Mission Statement is: To substantially improve the academic achievement and social development of 
every child by developing a rigorous curriculum, safe environment, the arts, and extracurricular activities that are 
tailored to their interest. We strive for this by working in partnership with students, parents and teachers through 
professional development, respect, and effective communication.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P. S. 153 the Homecrest School consisting of 548 students of which is comprised of the following: 49 % Female, 51 % 
Male , 36% Hispanic, 25% Asian, 01% Black, 31% White, 27% ELL, 82% General Education Students, and 18% Students 
with Disabilities  

In our efforts to support our mission, we collaborate with various stakeholders. Our partnerships include student 
teaching with Touro College and Brooklyn College. In addition we have a Community based organization with Chinese 
Planning Council which provides an after-school program daily. Parents are surveyed for educational workshops for 
the year and teachers supply these various workshops. Parents also have the opportunity to have weekly meetings 
with teacher during Parent Engagement Tuesdays. This act of collaboration enables parents and teacher om strategies 
to improve student progress. 

The P.S. 153 community participates in Strides for Breast cancer, The Sandy Hook Promise, and the Hurricane 
Florence Relief Initiative. We also participated in Make A Wish Foundation, Red Hats for the American Heart 
Association, and Britney's Baskets for Downs Syndrome. This enables to be conscious of community and global needs. 

 

P.S. 153 uses of data to inform our instruction by developing tools to support all our students' academic and 
social/emotional functioning including English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities. We also provide 
students with rigorous instruction to prepare them to be college and career ready. We always strive to use technology 
to prepare our students for the 21st century. As a school we collaborate with our colleagues to reflect on our 
practices to support students' growth and actively collaborate with our parents on how we can improve student 
progress. We consistently refine on our teaching practices in order to promote student progress . 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our school student population is comprised of 83% General Education Students and 17% Students with Disabilities. 
These SWD's include emotionally disabled, speech and language, learning disability, heath impairment needs, and 
autism. We also have flexible programming, assistive technology, and adhere to diverse learning styles. We are also 
involved in the XL program for SWD's. In addition ENL's account for 27% of our population.  

Our progamming includes SETTS, RTI, AIS, Self-contained, and ICT classes. Related service providers equip our 
impaired students will specialized services. ENL Programming includes push-in and pull out services as well as 
classroom teachers utilizing ENL strategies. We are also participating in the Continuous Learning Grant where 
Improvement Science for ELL's is being explored and implemented. Moby Max online instruction is explicitly utilized 
for our IEP students. 

It is through these efforts where we continue to strive to reach and teach all learners at P.S. 153. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Strong Family and Community was highlighted in the Principal's PPO for 2017-2018 as we created a Family Welcome 
Center for parent to have a sense of community and ownership within the school. Our Teacher Leadership team has 
built capacity for leadership within the school as evidenced by the 2017-2018 Learning Environment Survey which 
demonstrates a 3.89 in this area. The focus for this upcoming school year will be Effective School Leadership and 
Supportive Environment which score 3.11 for both in the Learning Environment Survey for 2017-2018. Our 
instructional areas for focus this year will be Danielson 1A, 3C, and 3D.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
In an effort to attract and develop high quality teachers to a school such as ours, we refer to organizations whose 
members are already stakeholders in our school community. We specifically form partnerships with local colleges and 
universities throughout New York City. We are strategic in our recruitment process for hiring highly skilled teachers by 
creating a plan that involves a collaborative team consisting of administrators, interview possible candidates and 
observe these candidates conducting lessons in a live classroom setting prior to determining whether or not this 
person is hired at PS 153K. Additionally, as a way of attracting highly qualified teachers, we have developed outreach 
strategies that involve finding interested candidates using the New York City Department of Education Open Market 
Hiring System, consulting with the Human Resource specialist, reviewing personal recommendations of candidates 
made by current PS 153K staff members and other classroom teachers, as well as inviting these potential candidates 
to visit our school to get a sense of what our school is like and to conduct demonstration lessons on site in a variety of 
content areas, while being observed by an Administrator. Over the years, as part of our plan for attracting and 
sustaining highly qualified teachers we have also formed collaborative partnerships with traditional teacher education 
institutions such as Teacher's College and Touro College as well as forming partnerships with alternative licensure 
programs like NYC Teaching Fellows. Many of these partnerships have also served as a resource for us in providing 
professional development for our teachers on a variety of instructional topics. As a school, we are constantly 
evaluating and revising the hiring process by using the Department of Education's Open Market Hiring System, 
revisiting the roles and responsibilities of teachers and constantly communicating the needs of our school with all 
prospective employees, so that they are aware of the expectations at PS 153K and are provided with an opportunity 
to continue to be lifelong learners. As a school we encourage our paraprofessionals and student teachers to continue 
their education, especially in high need areas such as students that are English Language Learners and Students with 
Disabilities. We try to keep an open door policy and welcome all those that are interested and are vested in making 
sure that our students are ready to meet the standards and go on to be college and career ready. To ensure that 
current staff members become highly qualified, each year we conduct a survey using the Basic Education Data System 
(BEDS). The BEDS survey is used to determine whether a teacher is considered Highly Qualified within their current 
assignment. If a teacher is not Highly Qualified based on lack of college credits, efforts are made by the principal to 
meet with each teacher and develop a plan to help the teacher. New Teachers who are not considered highly 
qualified are provided a mentor with a minimum of 2 meetings per week. Those teachers considered not Highly 
Qualified due to the lack of professional development will develop a professional development plan with their

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
In an effort to provide high quality professional development for staff members in order to support students to meet 
the Common Core Learning Standards, we analyze student data to determine areas of need and create and/or seek 
the appropriate support based on these trends. We also actively look for and/or create opportunities that enable our 
teachers to develop a deeper understanding of the Common Core Learning Standards while learning how to provide 
multiple entry points for students with disabilities and English language learners. Additionally, we meet with teachers 
to discuss their learning style trends so that we can match teachers to the appropriate professional development 
offerings. Teachers/ staff members who are involved in professional development workshops are encouraged to turn-
key the information they get from their outside professional development and share it with their colleagues. Teachers 
who are involved in professional development series are invited to facilitate professional learning communities 
whereby the work is shared, studied and applied across a series of classrooms. Additionally, to ensure all staff 
members are equipped to access and utilize the resources they need to learn and teach we provide technology 
training for teachers on the newest data systems, programs, and tools, such as SESIS, Smart Boards, STARS and PS153 
connects. In order to ensure all of the on-going professional development workshops and professional learning 
opportunities are improving student outcomes and are applicable to instructional practices, we provide teachers with 
opportunities to provide feedback. The data collected enables us to continue to tailor future professional 
development opportunities to meet the needs of our students through our staff’s learning.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
The transition plans implemented to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program include preparing students for the transition into kindergarten. One of the ways students are 
supported is by immersing them in a month long unit of study in June in preparation for kindergarten. The unit 
includes lessons that support children’s transitions, by helping them process their feelings about leaving pre-K and 
moving on to kindergarten. Students learn the differences and similarities between Pre-K and kindergarten. Through 
poetry, songs, and read alouds, students are exposed to kindergarten life. Teachers also bring students to visit the 
other areas of the school such as auditorium, cafeteria and upper floors of the building. . Students visit the

lunchroom, gym, library, and nurse’s office and kindergarten classrooms. They visit classrooms, observe, and take part 
in a lesson. The curriculum takes into consideration the amount of time required for a 4-5 year old child to make a 
successful transition into kindergarten. The dramatic play center is converted into a kindergarten classroom, giving 
students the opportunity to act out their feelings towards the upcoming changes they will face. Students visit their 
new school with their parents when they attend kindergarten registration and orientation. All students and parents 
are engaged in preparation for the upcoming year for Pre-K students. Staff members work collaboratively to ensure a 
smooth transition. Parents attend an orientation meeting where they meet kindergarten teachers as well as the 
administrative staff. Parents are invited for classroom tours during the later portion of the school year. As part of a 
tour, students visit classrooms with their parents so they both can get a glimpse into the elementary school 
environment. The school social worker, family worker, teachers, paraprofessionals and assistant principal work as a 
collaborative team to assist in the transition for the students and their families. There are workshops facilitated by the 
family worker and social worker with topics relevant to transitioning from Pre-K to kindergarten, with a focus on the 
social-emotional aspect of the transition to kindergarten. The assistant principal is able to follow student progress and 
social emotional growth of preschoolers by also frequently visiting kindergarten classrooms the following year. 
Teachers meet with parents during Parent Engagement Tuesdays in order to collaborate and formulate action plans 
for children who may face struggles. Kindergarten parents are empowered to support their children as they mature 
and face the challenges that lay ahead in elementary school. Administration also creates opportunities for staff 
communication. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
PS153K has a Measurement of Student Learning Committee made up of teachers who review and discuss, in 
collaboration with the principal, the assessment measures available for the school community to select. Teachers who 
expressed interest in joining the team were selected with consideration given to make sure all teacher groups were 
represented. This established team attended network meetings for training, met with each other and the principal to 
discuss the options available and what these choices would mean for all constituents. The collaborative decision 
regarding assessment selection was made by the committee for the school based on the best interest of students, 
time commitment and administrative guidelines  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 153 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary 
and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

PS153 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) Fifth Grade planning committee and Title I Parent Committee. This 
includes providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills. 

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office. 

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference;

activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

PS 153 in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Describe the direct instruction supplemental program here and include the 

rationale 

 
  subgroups and grade levels of students to be served  
  schedule and duration 
 
language of instruction 
  # and types of certified teachers 
 

types of materials  

Begin description here:            
  Rationale: 
Research has shown that the average talk time among English language learners (ELLs) is 1.6 
minutes. Our program is meant to help support their language acquisition by providing 
purposeful and meaningful academic interactions among each other as well as with instructors to 
increase the statistic above and foster their new language. The focus of our program will include 
four small groups which will enforce the “Think-Pair-Share” or “Circle Chat” model which 
suggested in a 2006 Colorin Colorado online article. 
(http://www.colorincolorado.org/article/13346) Teachers often only give students, on average, a 
response time of only a second and this programs hopes to immediately increase this period 
among instructors who are currently unaware of this statistic. It will instantly help students by 
providing additional time to build schema and increase wait time. The deeper in the program, the 
less the response wait time will be enforced, thus speeding up the process as they become more 
comfortable with their newly acquired English skills. This strategy and activity could also be 
observed in the students’ classrooms during the school day amongst the staff. 
Within these smaller learning groups, students are also welcomes to share their own culture and 
experiences to build text to self and text to world experience. It is important to respect every 
students culture and “seek ways to value cultural and linguistic differences and fully integrate 
them into the curriculum (Montecel and Cortez 2002, 15)”. 
Groups will be organized homogeneously as well as heterogenous which will change throughout 
the lifetime of the program. Although each student’s proficiency level is not grouped together, 
the individual reading level per student is grouped into one subgroup. The program includes 
intensive concentration on the four necessities of any language: listening, speaking, reading and 
writing. 
Subgroups: 
For the 2018-2019 school year we had a heavy number of “Expanding” or Advance proficiency 
students and we project to have a similar trend for the upcoming school year. We expect a 
significant growth in these students NYSESLAT level after attending the full program. We also 
tend to have a large Newcomer population and highly suggest these students to join the Title III 
program every year. It is imperative to build relationships amongst these students who are all 
jointly experiencing an American learning experience for the first time. These subgroups will be 
important in data collection as well as differentiating every lesson. Subgroups also include native 
Russian speaking students (our largest language population amongst the program) as well as a 
large Spanish speaking group in the upper grades (3-5). We have not received the list of students 
who plan to attend the upcoming years program but will update this document as information is 
verified. The total approximate number of students attending will vary from 50-126 2nd-5th 
grade current ELL students. 
Schedule & Duration: 
The program plans to run every Wednesday from October to March (Projected: 18 sessions). The 
program is afterschool from 2:25-4:00 (additional ten minutes is added for staff to discuss the 
day and possible planning for the next week’s session) 
Language of Instruction: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
  With our school’s languages varying between 15-20, it is nearly impossible to focus only on 
one language for instruction other than English. Having said that, Russian is the largest language 
represented and we will include many native language picture dictionaries as well as iPads to 
help aid native language support. 
Number and Types of Certified Teachers: 
From the entire student population attending the program, groups are broken down into four 
subgroups and two rooms. One common brand teachers as the main instructor and one ENL 
teacher per room. Each room houses two groups and that one ENL teacher “flip flops” amongst 
the two groups during each lesson. 
Types of Materials: 
Materials are supplemental and include but are not limited to: individual student folders, Native 
Language picture dictionaries, loose-leaf, computer paper, printer ink, pencils, glue sticks, 
crayons, markers as well as other art materials to help with creative projects.  

Part C: Professional Development  
Describe the school’s professional development program for Title III Program teachers as well as 
other staff responsible for delivery of instruction and services to ELLs.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  Rationale:It is important for every instructor to receive appropriate and useful professional 
development throughout the school year and instructors of our ELL population as not different. 
Teachers to Receive Training: 
The teachers working within the program will receive an introduction/refresher training prior to 
the commencement of the programs. 
Schedule and Duration: 
 Professional Development schedules are finalized the first few weeks of school which include a 
menu of options for teachers to choose to participate in. Administration also aids in assisting new 
teachers in choices contingent upon individual needs for their growing school career. Additional 
PD will take place once a month after students are dismissed for approximately 15-20 minutes. 
Topics to be covered: 
Topics will include but will not be limited to specific as well as new ELL strategies and the use 
of the curriculum to reach multiple interdisciplinary themes. A PD log will be implemented to 
record all trainings for this program. Also agendas and attendance sheets will be maintained in 
this folder/log. 
Name of Provider: 
 PDs are offered throughout the year from the DELLS office as well as UFT and other platforms 
for many teachers to learn tactics to help students’ SLA. Per diem allocations is provided for 
substitute coverage for teachers needing coverage throughout the school day. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   

  name of provider 
  how parents will be notified of these activities 

Begin description here:            
  Rationale: 
 The last fifteen minutes of every session is dedicated to “Share Out” and visitors are then 
welcome into the classrooms to observe and participate in student discussions. These visitors 
must be related or are guardians of one of the students attending the program. This will help 
supply parents and guardians with data on how their child performs inside the classroom in a 
more informal manner as well as with peers. During these “Share Outs” guardians are 
encouraged to sit with their child and listen to the review of the sessions topic. This could also 
help the adults with their understanding of academic English and possibly help support their own 
English language acquisition. A Parent Engagement log/folder will be kept to retain records of 
attendance and agendas. 
Schedule and Duration: 
After every session, “Open House” takes place from 3:45-4:00pm for appropriately 15 minutes. 
Topics to be covered: 
  A review of the session’s topic as well as any existing questions are to be presented during this 
time amongst students and their instructors. Videos aligned to the topic can also be shown to 
solidify comprehension. A Parent Needs Survey will be sent out in September to determine what 
workshop topics parents are interested in. The SLT team will also reinforce topics to be covered 
by our parent constituency. Topics such as learning the new curricula of Science and Social 
Studies will be offered as well as how to assist your ESL child this year. These workshops can 
take place during the school day if necessary. 
Name of Provider:  
n/a 
How Parents will be notified of these activities: 
Title III monthly newsletters will continue to be distributed at the first session of every month to 
share information as well as upcoming events within the program. Smaller blurbs of native 
language translation is provided in the top languages of our students for that year. 
The newsletters will be translated into the languages of the school.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
1. The assessing process commences once the HLIS and informal interview is performed during the registration process. Once 
the ENL teachers determine that the student is eligible for testing based on the results from the interview and Home Language 
Identification process, the NYSITELL is given to this student and from their score, we determine how much support the student 
needs to receive, according the the CR 154 ENL Units of Study. Also multiple times a year a Teacher's College (TC) Reading 
Assessment is given to all students to determine what literacy skills they currently possess by using Fountas and Pinnell. TC 
Running Records are performed to assess their reading and comprehension skills. Teachers are constantly assessing their 
students, formally and informally. Informal assessments are done during conferencing within the class and scores help 
determine further instruction.  ENL teachers supplement their instruction using content material as well as materials from the 
school's new ELA curriculum, Journeys. K-5 curriculum.  We noticed we have varying levels of proficiency, regardless of 
residential status. To help support each individual ELL student, each ENL instructor keeps a Language Acquisition folder on 
each of the students which is made readily available for students to review and look through. We use this tool to display the

growth the student has made in English and include Yearly Goals that are created for each of the students, including IEP goals 
if applicable.After assessing students with their first TC reading level assessment this year, data indicated we needed more 
emergent and Levels A-D for our Newcomer and Beginner speakers. Lower grade pedagogues helped supply upper grade staff 
with low level books and administration supplied a number of new texts specifically geared to help promote reading with the 
student population.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2. MOSL data is crucial for our school's performace review and we keep tedious notes are well as conference weekly with 
grade and subject levels. Common planning is utilized daily and emails such as Google Drive also help communication between 
teachers and staff. Any teacher can log into School Net to access student scores to monitor progress.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
3. Success of our program is to see continued growth in all four components in Language Acquisition. We pride ourselves on 
students who become proficient and continue to do well in the content area subjects. It is encouraging to see many of our 
students actively participating in different programs that our school has to offer. This demonstrates their absorption into our 
school community and into the community at large so they can become exemplary citizens.NYSESLAT scores are examine and 
re examined to monitor students' progress and ELA scores as also monitored to help any At-Risk ELLs or ELLs who are close to 
becoming Long-term ELLs (LTEs). Pedagogues who work with ELLs often have Annual Goals which are correlated with ELL 
success and we are supported by our principal to help meet our goals. The CALLA model is also encourage by all pedagogues 
working with ELLs and ELL instructors.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

4. If data informs that a student is under performing then action is taken immediately. Often times meetings are scheduled 
between the classroom teacher, SETSS teachers, any related service member and the ENL teachers with the students' 
guardians to make everyone aware of the issue. Meetings are done 4X a year between ENL teachers and parents to help them 
understand the growth or lack thereof with their children.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
5. Our school's PPT/SIT/RTI committee meets on a monthly basis and follows the proper protocol with regards to intervention 
services for ELLs. We also meet monthly with the Language Proficiency Team members to discuss Newcomer or transfer 
students to monitor the adjustment to our school. Teachers were given scaffold support with regards to implementing Tier I 
interventions such as goal setting, small group instruction, modified instruction and check-off to monitor the specific needs of 
a struggling student.The team members are readily available to help classroom teachers fill out the appropriate guidelines to 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 forms. We often reference the RTI "Creating an RTI Model for ELLs Academic Success" with ELL pedagogues, 
classroom teachers, IEP, SETSS instructors and other staff. Data collected helps us support our ELL population to implement 
more cohesive and effective small group instruction within the class and within our pull-out models. We also offer Extended 
Day for grades 2-5 twice a week and have started multiple inquiry teams within our staff to build more articulation. These 
inquiry teams share which strategies helped the students meet goals as well as supply necessary feedback on student's 
language acquisition.      
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
6. The data from yearly NYSESLAT scores reflects that as a school, we need more support in reading and writing skills. 
However, it also reflects positive growth as they grow from grade to grade. In our school students become more proficient 
faster in listening and speaking than in reading and writing. The NYSITELL is a great initial tool to see where the student started 
and the NYSELAT is a comparable tool to display how much the students learn in the course of one year.  We group each 
Emerging proficient student with an In-Class Buddy (of the same language or culture) to help foster good role modeling skills 
to use within the classroom. Teachers also differentiate homework and other projects for our lower proficiency students to 
help provide multiple means of presentation; including native language support, more interactive technology as well as 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

multiple step assistance.By the end of the first year, the students are able to have a conversation with their peers (BICS), but it 
is still difficult to express themselves academically. This goes across all grade levels. It is especially evident with kindergartens. 
At the time of administering the NYSITELL, many students do not know the letters or sounds of the letters, but on average in 
three months, these ELLs are speaking more fluently among classmates and teachers.  We constantly monitor student's prior 
knowledge by recording conferring as well as using their HLS as an indicator on how much formal education they received in 
their native country. If the student didn't receive any formal education, we have to supplement almost all of their instruction 
with strategies catering towards SIFE instruction. All of the assessments that our school performs demonstrate that ELLs grasp 
social skills much faster than academic language. Through assessment it is evident that writing is where ELLs fall short. We use 
AIS intervention as well as tutoring and Saturday school to help improve academic success for our struggling 
students. Although our students lack in Reading and Writing skills, 90% show growth in NYSESLAT scores and move from one 
or more levels higher than the previous years. 100%  of our students show growth, either in current proficiency level (if no 
movement was seen) or move to the next level up. The ELL Periodic Exam as well as conferencing one on one greatly helps 
determine future score on the NYSESLAT. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

7. Data always drives instruction and after a year of tedious data collection, as we school we decided the TCRWP ELA program 
was not appropriate for our type of students. We needed a more rigid, encompassing program which utilizes more SpEd and 
ENL strategies to help our students grow academically.  For the 2017-2018 we have rolled out a new ELA curriculum called 
Journeys which has multiple materials to help ELL students as well as students with special needs.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

a.  Within our ENL program, the model currently being used at PS 153 is the Push-In/Pull-Out Model. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

b. Currently our school does not have the numbers nor request to open a TBE program but since our numbers are 
slowly approaching the minimum amount to open, we would open a K/1 Russian Bilingual program, serving the 
children in a 70/30, 50/50 then 30/70 model. We will employ certified bilingual teachers to instruct the ELA and Math 
and would infuse both languages into our cluster classes using vocabulary, authentic texts and cultural specific 
themes. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

c. Currently our school does not have the numbers nor request to open a DL program but since our numbers are 
slowly approaching the minimum amount to open, we would open a K/1 Russian Bilingual program, serving the 
children in a 50/50 model. We will employ certified bilingual teachers to instruct the ELA and Math and would infuse 
both languages into our cluster classes using vocabulary, authentic texts and cultural specific themes.   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

 2.  Our ENL instructors tediously comb through student rosters to guarantee every current and Tested Out ELL receives the 
appropriate amount of ENL instruction per week. We organize schedules around ENL instruction time and make sure our 
students receive the appropriate amount according to their individual needs. The following five proficiency levels and units of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

study are as followed:EN (Entering Proficiency) - requires 180 mins of ENL/ELA, 180 mins of ENL/ELA= 360 units of study per 
weekEM (Emerging Proficiency) - requires 90 mins of ENL/ELA, 180 mins of ENL/ELA, 90 minutes of Stand-Alone or Integrated 
= 360 units of study per weekTR (Transitioning Proficiency) - requires 90 mins of ENL/ELA, 90 mins of Stand-Alone or 
Integrated = 180 units of study per weekEX (Expanding Proficiency) - requires 180 mins of ENL/ELA = 180 units of study per 
weekCM (Commanding Proficiency) - requires 90 mins of Integrated ENL/ELA= 90 units of study per weekAccording to the NYS 
mandated law, it is required that students who Tested Out still receive ENL services and all the ESL certified pedagogues work 
to ensure that we are in compliance and that every student is receiving appropriate services. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 3. Planning and collaboration is performed by all Push-In/Pull-Out pedagogues with the grade classroom teacher they are 
working with.  They share upcoming themes and strategies that will be enforced in either class setting. Specific core content 
periods are designated each day for each classroom teacher in English and is supported by Push-In/Pull-Out instructors. We 
currently use TC as our ELA curriculum (reading and writing) and the teachers adhere to that model for all reading and writing 
periods.  The ESL self-contained classrooms use the sheltered English model with regards to their ENL units of study. They also 
adhere to the same content specific periods throughout the week much like their grade level colleagues. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

4. Students are given the opportunity to use their native language to express an answer and an interpreter will translate 
answers for the teacher to score. If it is the first year of English instruction, state tests such as the 3-12 Math test can be given 
in their NL. The 4th grade state Science test can also be given in their NL with help of a native speaker proctoring the lab 
portion. NL dictionaries are also supplied during all tests to help with comprehension.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

5. All current ELLs receive the appropriate number of units of study according to their current proficiency level. They also 
receive testing accommodations for all state tests, which include time extension and separate locations. We also provide 
native language dictionaries to help guide comprehension for the math and science exam. Visual cues are a constant part of 
every lesson in order to bridge the gap between the student's native language and English. Sentence Starters are provided to 
all Newcomers to help foster comprehension. Graphic Organizers (GO) folders are given to every Transitioning proficient 
student to help them during the writing process and it provides a sense of in dependency to choose and fill out the 
appropriate GO to the task at hand.a. On the rare occasion that our school receives a SIFE ELL student we use a sheltered 
English approach to help their English flourish in a short period of time. We use the SIFE curriculum found on the NYC DOE 
website and use multiple means of delivery such as images, technology (iPads, Smart Board, laptops, online interactive games) 
to help the student become exposed to the language in a calculated but meaningful way.b. All Newcomer students receive a 
Newcomer Packet when first entering the school building which includes a free leveled book, images and labels with native 
language support which helps guide them during the first few weeks and an alphabet and blend chart to get them started on 
learning their new language as quickly as possible. Newcomer students are also paired with an in-class partner student who 
shares their language and helps with any interpretation needs. Eventually, this partner student is slowly removed so the 
Newcomer has to start to use English to voice their wants and participate in class. Newcomers are given differentiated 
homework by all of their teachers (including clusters) and their native language is encouraged as much as possible all while 
being exposed to new vocabulary daily. c. For our developing ELLs, we continue to use ELL strategies to flourish their language 
development. We introduce multiple opportunities to have In-Class aloud speaking activities such as Share-Outs, Reader's 
Theatre and other informal opportunities to help them develop positive speaking skills as well as build their social engagement 
within the language with their peers. We continue to use the above strategies as mentioned for all of our ELL students and we 
provide more independence with regards to less 1-1 conferencing during class work and more chances to use choices to final 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

products such as projects and final published pieces. d. We currently have no Long-Term ELLs enrolled in our school. If we did, 
we would look deeply into their old state tests including their NYSESLAT scores and cater instruction specifically to those 
needed areas. e. For ELLs who exit the program after testing-out, ENL teachers provide in class support (90 minutes a week/ .5 
units of ENL) which provides parallel teaching opportunities  to support learning for our non-ELLs who test out of the ENL 
program. Those students who tested out within the past two years receive testing accommodations for all state tests such as 
time extension and being in a separate location.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
6. The ENL instructors use a combination of TC materials as well as Rigby "On Our Way to English" to support their instruction. 
Every teacher also has an arsenal of graphic organizers at their disposal to provide to students during the reading or writing 
process. IPads were purchased and circulate throughout the upper grader classrooms during Push-In/Pull-Out ENL instructions. 
Apps on the iPad which supplement content include: Brain Pop ESL, Sentence Builder, ABCYA and other educational games 
that help the language acquisitions process. The Native Language Library is also at students disposal in the ENL office and 
students are encouraged to read in their native language just as much as they read in English. We are constantly buying and 
building this library because authentic books in Urdu and Uzbek have been a challenge to find this past school year. The SETSS 
teacher and other SpEd instructors comb through the IEPs of our students at the start of each year and they determine each 
individual accommodation as well as service. The ENL instructors also participate during this process and they guide the SETSS 
teachers about the student's history in the ENL program. Schedules are made accordingly so that the student is only receiving 
one service a period (not ENL and SETSS or APE).     
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
7. In the beginning of every school year, the ENL as well as classroom teachers create goals for each student to strive to 
achieve throughout the year. These goal are often students chosen and are always aligned to the common core. Such goals are 
then posted in each classroom for the students to see and be reminded of. These goals are also aligned to specific goals set in a 
student's IEP PLOP. The goals are revisited if their IEP is updated throughout the school year.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
8.  The school provides AIS periods for the bottom third performing students throughout the school week. Teachers support 
any student, including ELLs with this tutoring period in small group instruction. The administration also encourages each 
teachers to focus special attention to a Case Study Student  throughout the school year. Each case study student is usually a 
male and may or may not be receiving ENL services. The staff meets vertically and horizontally throughout the year to discuss 
their case studies and make goals to help the students succeed.  Science instruction is differentiated for our ELL students by 
implementing more visuals and native language dictionaries within their science units of study. The science teacher, Mrs. 
Martin implements technology such as use of iPads to show videos of the experiments prior to the students doing the 
experiment to expose them to the process and steps involved. Science homework is also differentiated. Targeted instruction 
for social studies take place within the mainstream classroom setting and it include visual, use of videos and hands-on 
experiences to help drive ENL instruction. There is an Behavioral Intervention Team as well as Intervention Team (consisting of 
SETSS teachers and other service providers) which monitor growth or lack thereof for all the students, including our ELLs. Data 
is collected monthly and reported to administration as well as classroom teachers who can then implement changes or 
continue to use successful practices.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

9. We piloted a new Close Reading Program for our Title III ESL program in the 2014-2015 school year. We purchased Guided 
Reading Program from Scholastic. Groups were organized according to student's current reading levels and a dual teacher 
instruction was implemented. Groups changed throughout the school year according to the individual student growth in their 
TC reading levels. We also continue to use Brain POP ESL throughout the entire school to help Newcomer ELLs inside the 
classroom during the school day.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

10. Although we were awarded a grant to use the Spelling City program during the 2012-2014 school year which has Spanish 
vocabulary, we had to discontinue the use due to lack of funding. The program was successful although hard to implement 
during the school day inside the classroom.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
11.  All ELLs are welcome to join any after-school program and the Title III program is exclusive to ELLs and many use the 
opportunity to join and participate. Programs throughout the year that invite parental engagement include:  Student of the 
Month Assemblies,  monthly PTA meetings, Make a Wish Halloween Parade, Pick-A-Pumpkin Fundraiser, in-class Thanksgiving 
feasts, race to Read Holiday contest, Holiday Show,  Carnival, Dance Festival, Fifth Grade Orientation, etc. All parents and 
guardians are welcome to join and multilingual letters are sent home to aid in translating information about such events.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
12. The ELLs are given many materials to help facilitate and foster learning and they range in degree. Every classroom is 
equip with an ELL specific iPad which ten can be used for translation services and other such support. Pebble Go was also 
bought for the 2016-2017 school year which supplies science instruction with audio support and native language 
support. Subgroups have different iPads with appropriately downloaded apps that foster positive language interaction such as 
repetition of vocabulary or sentence building. All groups have access to native language dictionaries as well  as authentic books 
in their native language to borrow at anytime.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

13.  The ENL department has been amassing multiple books in many languages are encourage students to borrow from that 
Native Language Library (found in the ENL room).   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

14. The ENL teachers constantly review documents such as ATS reports in order to monitor if all the ELLs and former ELLs are 
being properly serviced. Required service and supports correspond to students age level and materials are used which are 
conducive to their appropriate age group. Although all grades are exposed to Non-Fiction texts, most of the texts in K-2 have a 
fictional focus such as fables, folktales and other themes which are appropriate for the ages 5-8. 
Student feedback is also utilized and students are given a crucial role in choosing new programs. After one year of instruction 
using Pebble Go, students shared they wanted a different science supplemental program since the Pebble Go program was not 
expansive enough. We are looking to change and buy another supplemental program come the Fall of 2017.  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
15. The ELLs are given many materials to help facilitate and foster learning and they range in degree. Classroom teachers are 
encouraged to have their Newcomer students use Brain Pop ESL three times a week during instruction time.  Subgroups have 
different iPads with appropriately downloaded apps that foster positive language interaction such as repetition of vocabulary 
or sentence building. All groups have access to native language dictionaries as well  as authentic books in their native language 
to borrow at anytime.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
16. Currently, there are no activities to provide newly enrolled ELLs with support before the school year begins. Depending on 
budget restrictions for next year, activities may or may not be included within our school.     
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

17. There are currently no electives offered within our school. We do have an Enrichment program which benefits all K-5 
students with recreational and arts related activities but non are language focused.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

18. n/a  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1.  The staff is given many opportunities to choose the PD of their liking every Monday during the PD planning hour (2:20-
3:35). These Professional Developments range in topic from Formative Assessment, Rubriccs as well as ENL strategies to use 
inside the classroom. The school's administration is wonderful in providing additional speakers outside of the building to help 
train the staff. The ENL teachers are also used as facilitators during these PD opportunities. The tentative PD Calendar for the 
2015-2016 school year is as followed: 
Sept 21, 28: Book Study (Mr. SantaMaria, Principal) 
Oct 5: Book Study (Mr. Santa Maria, Principal) 
Oct 19: Engaging Children More Deeply with Non-Fiction Texts (Gutman, Scali, Campo- Classroom Teachers) 
Nov 2: K-2 ELL: Ways To Use Non-Fiction (Ms. Franchi, Mrs. Gordon, Ms. ElChami- ESL teachers) 
Nov 16: ELL Institute- Intro Course of Teaching ELLs for New Teachers (Ms. Niesi- ESL teacher) 
Dec 17: K-8 Tap the Power of Books (Spy, Smoudinas, Cannizzaro, Trovato- Classroom Teachers) 
2.  The administration provides all staff with a "Common Core Standards and Strategies Flip Chart" every year which helps 
teachers write lessons using grade appropriate standards. All PDs are aligned to the Common Core and have a clearly stated 
goal with one or two standards in mind which helps the teachers comprehend the suggested outcome. Some PDs are even 
focused on certain whole categories within one standard like "Language Standards" or "Standards for Literature".    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
2. The parent coordinator provides the parents with many documents helping to guide the ELLs as well as the rest of the 
graduating class to help the transition from elementary to middle school. These documents can be provided in other languages 
and the parents are welcome to attend the 5th Grade Middle School Fair which occurs around January of each year. Our 
guidance counselor, Ms. Nunno is provided with PDs and workshops which help her learn strategies to help guide transitioning 
ELL students throughout the year. She also attends PD workshops that are ENL focused in-house.We also provide multiple 
activites for our graduating class to help the transiton from elementary school to middle school become less stressful. We have 
"Middle School Day" in which 5th grade teachers treat the 5th graders as if they are in middle school for the day with more 
independence and less verbal support to help them visualize what it will be like for the next school year.   The administration 
provides us with a Professional Development handbook in which we record any PDs that we attend throughout the school year 
(including every Monday's PD session). Administration also encourages the ENL teachers to attend PDs outside of the school 
and asks if we wish to turn-key any new information to the rest of the staff. According to the new changes to the state 
mandate, all ESL certified pedagogues must receive 50% of their PD hours in ESL and the rest of the classroom teachers on our 
staff must receive 15% of all of their PDs in ESL. The administration works tediously to survery the staff to ask which types of 
focuses we would need to help our instruction. After the menu is sent out and filled in, the PD committee selects appropriate 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

workshops and trainings for the school year. The ESL certified instructors turn-key many strategies and useful techniques to 
help the classroom teachers reach their ELL students.    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
1. Every September, the ENL department hosts a "ENL Orientation" Meeting which provides information about our ENL 
program. The parents who attend are provided with a pamphlet outlining the different programs they can choose from and 
each parent is given ample time to view the NYC DOE Parent Information video via iPads and other devices. Parents are 
encouraged to ask questions as well as provide us with any concerns they have for their child. Around December, the ENL 
department hosts another "open house" opportunity in which parents and guardians are welcomed back into the school to 
discuss their child's language acquisition and any concerns the teachers had for each child. Positive letters are sent home 
multiple times throughout the school year (in native language, if necessary) which helps parents who cannot attend such 
meetings understand the growth their child is making or not making inside the classroom.    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
2.  We offer an "open house" every Tuesday in which parents and guardians can come into the classroom and reserve a private 
meeting with their child's teacher. Interpreters are provided and teachers provide a pamphlet in order for the parent to 
understand the topic and issues discussed during such meeting. 
Multiple events throughout the school year showcase cultural differences and parents are always invited to share and 
participate.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Carl Santamaria, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

PS 153 provides all the accommodations possible to our families. During the registration process, dual language 
pedagogues are used to assist parents. Assessment of the Home Language Surveys informs school staff of home 
language and preferred method of communication, all available data is used to ensure staff is cognoscente of 
family language needs including but not limited to ATS, Blue cards and surveys. In our school we provide all the 
accommodations possible to our students’ parents. During the registration process, we have our pedagogues who 
speak languages such as: Russian, Chinese, Spanish and Urdu offer their assistance. After the registration is 
complete we assess the Home Language Surveys where the home language is indicated, Parents’ Preferred 
Language form is also offered to our parents. During orientation we provide in-house school staff for translation

services. Our pedagogues are always available for translation and interpretation. All of these services allow us to 
assess the school population and its needs. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Spanish (145 families), English (137 families) and Russian (67 families) speakers make up the largest percentage of 
native speakers within our community and we often use in school translators and interpreters to assist with day to 
day communication.  

Our school also utilizes REMIND which is an automatic and electronic messaging system which reaches out to our 
entire school community to communicate important messages. We also use in-staff translators to aid in time specific 
and emergency situations in which interpretation is urgent and immediate.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

In the beginning of the school year, we have a faculty meeting in which we reread and revisit city regulations as well 
as school policy. In the start of each school year we inform the parents of all the available services and resources 
available to them. We inform them there is a Translation and Interpretation Unit in the Department of Education that 
provides services for non-English speaking parents that offer written and oral services in their home languages. We 
inform the parents that they will be getting letters and notices in their home languages they chose in the beginning of 
the year. We also introduce the parents to our staff members who can be of service for translation and interpretation. 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At the ENL orientation in the Spring as well as at the first PA meeting in September families will be notified about 
translation and interpretation services as well as a reminder each time the family is invited into the school. Our school 
also has multiple signage in the front of the entrance which shows an important information regarding school 
material.  

 
  

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

 

We often send home surveys and questionnaires regarding communication chain between the school and home. In 
the beginning of the year we determine which households need forms in different languages and we keep a copy in 
every office that sends home letters.
