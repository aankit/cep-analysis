Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We believe in the transformative powers of a dual language education, to create students that are leaders, 
problem solvers, imagine, and collaborate in the construction of new knowledge. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

As part of our commitment to creating students that are leaders, the P.S. 595 community fosters respect for 
independent and 
critical thinking, social awareness and opportunities for collabortation in learning about the world around us. We 
believe education is communal responsibility among students, parents and teachers. At P.S. 595, hands on learning is 
central to our education, we understand the critical role real world connections and the arts play in the development 
of the whole child. Therefore, field trips, music, visual arts, dance and drama are an integral part of everyday life. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

P.S. 595 has 23% of its students with special needs. Although the needs vary, many students have 
sensory integration issues. 

P.S. 595 14% students who are learning English as a new language. Although the majority of students first 
language is Spanish, we have students who speak French and Arabic. 

Strategies and Interventions for English as a New Language Learners and Students with Disabilities: 
• Support charts with question prompts 
• Small group instruction 
• Support charts with conversation tools and habits 
• Push in RTI 
• UDL (Universal Design for Learning) strategies 
• Academic Intervention Service team will support high need subgroups by using research-based programs, 
such as Fundations, Leveled Literacy Intervention and Go Math! Intervention, to target instructional needs. 
• The administration supports intervention by developing schedules, providing professional development, and 
leading conversations that address students with disabilities, English-language learners, and students at-risk. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We are a new school in 2018-2019. 

 

 
 
 

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year.

Strengths: 
• At P.S. 595 curriculum is organized into units of study that emphasize authentic learning experiences and that 
engage students in the 21st-century skills. In each unit our students go beyond the textbook to study complex topics 
based on real-world issues, such as exploring how communities change over time, comparing and contrasting 
information from multiple sources and texts. Working in collaborative groups and guided by teachers, students learn 
the skills of collaborating, expression of opinions, and constructing new meaning in groups. Each member of the team 
is responsible for learning the content as well as helping their peers to learn. 
Our goal is, QR 3.4 establishing a culture for learning that communicates high expectations 
to staff, students and families and provides supports to achieve those expectations. 

Priority Needs: 
• We have high expectations for academic rigor in our school. We have implemented school-wide structures in 
order to promote opportunities and supports for students to self-assess. Teachers have identified the need to ensure 
there are more opportunities for students to self-assess and explain their thinking in order to increase the rigor of 
student discussion. We have identified the need to evaluate the rigor of tasks to ensure units offer multiple 
opportunities for students to think critically and engage in analysis and problem-solving through discussion along with 
increasing the opportunities for students to present projects. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, on average students will move up 4 reading levels in Fountas and Pinnell through small group instruction, 
and the use of leveled reading groups and strategy groups.

communities, the principal will purchase research-based 
professional texts that explore strategies to teach metacognition, 
such as Teaching Students to Drive their Brains by Donna Wilson 
and Marcus Conyers. Based on research, Teachers will acquire 
one research-based strategy to implement in the classroom so 
students developing the ability to identify learning goals, ask 
thoughtful questions, and apply self-monitoring strategies. 

 

• The principal will schedule common planning time so teachers 
can use data to identifying learning goals, scaffold assignments 
based on students learning goals, create thoughtful and rigorous 
questions, implement meta cognitive strategies, and create 
opportunities in all lessons for students to reflect and self-
monitor learning goals.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We are in the first year of implementing a Responsive Classroom curriculum, where we create safe, joyful and 
challenging learning environments where all students feel valued and respected. 

As we begin to support our students towards acquiring 21st century skills, at P.S. 595, we have acknowledged that 
teachers are able to address academic and social-emotional concerns of their students. Throughout our 
school, teachers implement responsive classroom in order to create a safe school community. It is through this 
program that our students are able to develop self-control, and begin to understand what socially responsible 
behavior is. Integration of current brain research into teaching strategies supports positive learning outcomes for all 
children, where children’s strengths are nurtured and used to connect them to new knowledge, and their culture and 
home languages are recognized as essential elements of learning. 

Priority Needs: 
Our classrooms have a safe environment that engages all students, but we still need to improve the quality of our 
feedback to students. Our school needs to use our feedback structures to lift students and provoke critical thinking, 
and coach students into becoming strong readers, writers and leaders. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 80% of parents will agree on the NYC School Survey that "my child is safe at school".

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 595x, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

<PS 595> will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Addendum: Community School Partnerships 

Directions: The Community School (CS) strategy is directly aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. Community 
Schools bring schools and community partners together and integrate academics, health, youth development, and 
family engagement to provide students with the tools and opportunities they need to succeed.  The Core Services in 
Community Schools are Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family Engagement, and Health & 
Wellness. 
 
Part 1 – Community School Partnerships Goal(s) 

How is the CS strategy integrated into academic instruction at your school, and what impact has it had on student 
academic outcomes?  
ASPIRA is the CBO that provides as an Extended Learning opportunity for our students. 

 
Indicate the summative goal(s) of the Community School for the 2018-19 school year. Be sure to construct the goal to 
be SMART – Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound.   
By June 2019 the percentage of chronically absent students will decrease by 5%. 

 

 

Please answer the following Question as it relates to meeting your Community School Annual Goal(s): 
How will achieving your Community School Goal(s)--in Expanded Learning Time (ELT), Attendance Supports, Family 
Engagement, and Health & Wellness--support your academic goals for students?

Community Schools are expected to partner with a community-based partner organization (CBO) and 
together with members of the School Leadership Team, hire a Community School Director. The Director will 
lead implementation of the asset and needs assessment process, and other critically important coordinating 
activities. Indicate how you will leverage this aspect of the work. 
Community Schools are expected to personalize the needs of all students, through strategic programming and 
services, as determined by the asset and needs assessment, and must also offer Expanded Learning Time 
(ELT) and mental health programming. In completing this section, ensure that you think about how: (1) the 
right services are provided to the right students and families at the right time; and (2) how you will seamlessly 
coordinate services with instructional programming happening throughout and outside of the school day. 
Indicate how you will implement this work, and describe other programming you anticipate to be in place to 
strengthen this initiative. 
Community Schools are expected to emerge as Partnership Schools, which are places where parents and 
families feel welcome, actively participate in the conversation and decision-making around the renewal of 
their schools, and have many opportunities to advocate for their children. Monthly meetings and Community 
School Forums engaging families and community stakeholders will be a critical part of this family engagement 
strategy. Describe how you will implement this aspect of the work. 
Community School Principals are expected to meet on a weekly basis with their Community School Director, 
select Assistant Principals, key staff, and other CBOs, to analyze trends in data and case manage individual 
students. Data tools – including the New Visions Data Sorter - and training will be available for schools to use. 
Indicate how you will implement this aspect of the work.

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, teacher-created 

assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
In dual language classrooms: 
* EL SOL 
* Estrellita 
* Fountas & Pinnell (adminstered three times a year) 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Once children are assessed for their Fountas and Pinnell levels, teachers create guided reading groups based on the reading data collected 
allowing them to meet with all their students 2-3 times a week. For children who are significantly below the bench mark level, an 
academic interventionist specialist meets with children two to three times a week between assessment cycles to support progress. 
These academic intervention specialists include: the ENL teacher and SETTs teacher. Students with IEPS are served by the SETTS teacher or the 
Special Education Teacher in the ICT classrooms. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL Periodic 

Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use NYC performance math tasks in the beginning of the year for math assessment data as well as 
assessments and performance tasks provided by the Go Math curriculum. For literacy we use the Fountas and Pinnell for assessments in both 
English and Spanish baselines and progress monitoring throughout the year. Pre- and post-on demand writing assessments are administered 
for each of the 5 writing units of the year. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once data is collected, a reading and math goal is created for each child for the year. These goals are created to ensure at least a year's worth 
of growth. Through MOSL, we use the Growth Option, thus the goals are entered in the NYC Advance system. Classroom teachers monitor 
progress through sharing data during grade level meetings and to the Instructional cabinet that meets weekly. This team is comprised of 
the ENL teacher, bilingual SETTs teacher, a bilingual teacher, and the principal. Students in special education who are behind grade level goals 
are provided SPIRE intervention in 6-8 week cycles by the Bilingual SETTS teacher. Students in 
non special education setting who are behind grade level are provided with Fountas and Pinnell's Leveled Literacy Intervention (LLI).  Students' 
progress is monitored with formative assessments to measure improvement every 4 to 6 weeks 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-5). [Refer to ELL 

Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We support our ELLs under the RTI structure; design research-based instruction that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for ELLs; best 
use assessments to guide daily instruction (Tier1); and best design instructional routines and interventions in Tiers 2 and 3. We ensure our Tier 
1, Core Instruction, includes instruction that supports the needs of our ELLs by teaching the language through the content. Teachers design 
lessons with language objectives throughout all content areas by ensuring strong scaffolds for a variety of language levels access, For example, 
teachers implicitly and explicitly teach content area vocabulary in inquiry-based studies. Students have multiple exposures to new words and 
see those words used in context. All ELL students are given reading intervention in small groups with in the classroom. These groups work 2-3 
days a week for a 6-8 week cycle. At the end of the cycle students are reassessed and the groups are reformed according to students' needs. If 
progress is slow or not evident, the child is given more frequent time in small groups with an emphasis on a particular strategy. If after more 
frequent small group instruction, the child still has slow progress, they begin to work specifically with the ENL teacher who pushes in 
and supports the students in the classroom. The ENL teacher works closely with the classroom teacher to share information and collaborate 
on reinforcing particular skills.. While ELL students who speak Spanish as their home language in kindergarten and first grade are served in 
both Spanish and English, students who are ELLs in second grade are given intervention exclusively in English with strong language 
development strategies in place as part of the intervention. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? ([Refer to the ELL 

Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
English and Spanish Fountas and Pinnell levels, end of unit assessments in Math, Math performance tasks, NYSESLAT are used to 
evaluate and inform our ELL programs. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

We share data with each grade team to identify school wide trends. During grade level meetings grade team consider grade level trends. 
Further members of of the Language Allocation Policy Team will also review this data with the Instructional Cabinet that meets weekly to 
determine goals and action plans for whole school trends. 

 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Our ENL Program is specified for all students in the second grade and the self-contained 12:1:1 kindergarten 
and first grade bridge. These students are provided ENL services for their mandated minutes by the English as a 
New Language teacher. These students are pulled into small groups for services within the classroom. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

P.S. 595 follows a Dual Language Program through a 50/50 alternating day model. Therefore, ENL instruction is 
provided during English instruction and instruction is differentiated based on student proficiency level and time 
allotments as per CR Part 154. All content and literacy instruction in English is delivered using ENL methodologies and 
all instruction is differentiated to support the linguistic and literacy diversity in the classrooms. All K-4 students 
receive literacy instruction and content instruction in the new language and the home language. Classrooms are 
comprised of heterogeneously mixed ELLs and Non-ELLs as peer language models are essential for the oral language 
development of all students. Within our ICT dual language classrooms, instruction occurs in self-contained classrooms 
provided by one certified and highly qualified bilingual teacher. During ENL instruction, the bilingual teachers provides 
targeted and differentiated ENL strategies and scaffolds for ELLs to ensure language progression. Teachers plan for 
content and language objectives (the latter reflecting differentiation based on level of language proficiency and 
literacy data). 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

We use the guidelines from CR Part 154 and we program class schedules and student schedules accordingly in STARS, ensuring 
that all mandated minutes are explicitly accounted for and that these are integrated within content area instruction as well as 
English language skills. We have a literacy block of a minimum of 120 minutes, which is inclusive of all components of balanced 
literacy. Students in dual language classrooms receive literacy instruction in both languages as read aloud, shared reading, 
shared writing, and interactive writing occur in both languages on a daily basis (through the literacy component and through 
content area instruction). In addition, ENL integrated instruction is included as part of the literacy block and the content area 
instruction as teachers plan for content and language goals in all content areas. ENL instruction and ELA instruction is provided 
during the 120 minutes literacy block. The students receive targeted instructional that builds upon oral language development 
and English literacy skills through explicit teaching, addressing all four modalities. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Teachers plan intentionally for content, literacy, and language objectives using: literacy data (F&P Benchmark in either one 
language or both languages); NYSITELL/NYSELSAT data; CCLS (inclusive of Reading, Writing, Speaking and Listening, Reading 
Foundational Standards, and Language Standards); our core curricula--TCRWP Units of Studies, Fundations, Estrellita, Inquiry 
based units which integrate literacy and the NYCDOE Scope and Sequence for Science, NYCDOE Scope and Sequence for Social 
Studies, Math Units of Studies aligned to CCLS; and knowledge of best literacy and ELL research based practices. To support 
background knowledge and vocabulary, we use an inquiry-based approach to learning (thematic/interdisciplinary), where 
students are immersed in hands-on experiences through trips, media, visual, and front-loading of vocabulary. In cooperative 
group settings students use graphic organizers, such as concept maps and semantic maps, to support the oral language 
development and academic language and writing. Sentence frames and starters (differentiated for various proficiency levels) 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

are provided to support students to engage in academic discourse. Explicit teaching of tier 2 words throughout the school 
allows for the development of academic vocabulary for all students. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We use the following assessments: Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark in Spanish, Estrellita, Engage NY Math End of unit 
assessments in Spanish and English, TCRWP Literacy Rubric to assess writing samples in Spanish, and teacher-created 
assessments.  Classrooms are supplied with English and Spanish libraries, word walls, content word walls, and other bilingual 
materials. Bilingual speakers are brought in to share experiences with children in both English and Spanish. Field trips that 
provide experiences in either Spanish or English are also provided. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

As a K-2 school, P.S. 595 does not have SIFE students. For our Newcomers, we provide differentiated instruction as teachers 
intentionally plan literacy, content, and language objectives with in all content areas. Entering, Emergent, and Transitioning 
students are provided with daily explicit language instruction in heterogenous and homogenous grouping through shared 
reading and inquiry based tasks that support the targeted linguistic need. This is in addition to the integrated ENL instruction. 
Teachers differentiate by planning for language demands based on analysis of text complexity and student needs for all ELLs. 
ELLs who are in the Advanced and Commanding Stages, are also provided with targeted integrated ENL instruction based on 
literacy, and linguistic data, throughout the content areas and literacy block. In addition, targeted language instruction is 
provided as part of our after-school Title 3 program, as students are immersed in rigorous inquiry-based/science units of 
studies that focus on academic language development. For students who are Developing ELLs, and students who are potential 
Developing ELLs, additional targeted instruction/ intervention is provided by the ENL teacher as part of RTI for ELLs (Tier 2 
services). 
For former ELLs, we provide all supports needed as per their data and as per CR Part 154.2 mandated services. In the  dual-
language program, former ELLs will continue to receive ENL services with their classroom teachers. In 
the monolingual second grade classrooms, former ELLs will continue to receive ENL services with the ENL teacher.  Teachers 
use ESL strategies and scaffolds to ensure students have supports needed to access the CCLS aligned units of study Testing 
accommodations for ELLs and Former ELLs are as follows: Students will received time-and-a-half on all tests/assessments 
requiring time limits. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers continue to plan for language and literacy outcome for all students in order to provide differentiated instruction. 
Through flexible grouping, multiple entry points, and Universal-by-Design planning, teachers ensure IEP goals are met. 
Students continue to be immersed in TCRWP units of studies and mentor texts, as well as texts used in our inter-disciplinary 
units of studies. Teachers include (add on) text sets of various levels to support the content understandings. Targeted goals for 
students include language goals and language of instruction as needed, to ensure 2nd language and literacy progression. 
Teachers use both grade leveled texts with appropriate scaffolds for comprehension and guided texts based on their level of 
instruction, as per running records and F&P benchmark. In addition, teacher teams study and implement strategies for 
intervention. All students are immersed in rigorous CCLS aligned instruction that is developmentally and grade level 
appropriate. Texts are never "watered down", rather the scaffolds placed allow for students to access the content. ELL-SWD 
students are also supported through the use of Fundations phonics program, afterschool tutoring, our summer school program 
for non-mandated students, and reading intervention during the school day. Our SETTS teacher will use the SPIRE intervention 
program to target struggling readers in Tier II and Tier III for instruction. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

Of our 7 K-2 classrooms, 3 are ICT classrooms.  The K-1 ICT classrooms (2) follow a dual language, 50/50, English/Spanish 
Model. Therefore, we offer our ELL-SWDs the least restrictive environment with highly qualified personnel in the DL ICT 
classrooms, as these teacher teams are specialized in special education, bilingual education, and early childhood education or 
common branch licences. Our teacher teams provide small group and differentiated (targeted) instruction throughout the day 
to ensure students meet their IEP goals. In addition, we have an ESL teacher who provides additional targeted intervention in 
the English monolingual ICT second grade classroom and in the 12:1:1 classroom. Our bilingual SETSS teacher provides 
mandated at-risk services and ensures articulation with all teachers. We have 1 bilingual speech teachers in the building, who 
in addition to serving their mandated students provide support with at-risk intervention services and "consults" as needed. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
We provide targeted instruction as per student needs. For students who are in the transitioning stage and above, and where 
the literacy data reveals comprehension and phonics instructions needs to be strengthened, we use The Fountas & Pinnell 
Leveled Literacy Intervention System (LLI) as a small-group, supplementary literacy intervention as data demonstrates that LLI 
is an effective short-term intervention for struggling readers who are also classified as English Language Learners. We also use 
a double dose of FUNdations in English and a double dose of Estrellita in Spanish. In Math, teachers use End-of-Unit 
assessments through GoMath to identify and target specific skills/strands to focus in on and provide small group instruction 
with progress monitoring. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Not applicable.  This is our first year as a school. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Not applicable. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are included in all school programs. They have access to the variety of programs we offer such as: music, art, robotics. 
The arts and STEM teachers plan for linguistic and cultural competencies, as questioning and discussion are intentionally 
planned for, as is awareness of various cultural traditions (which are reflective of our families).  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Each of our units are thematically planned to incorporate hands on experiences, field trips, and connections to science and 
social studies. Technology is used to provide visuals of the subject matter and interactive experiences using SmartBoards.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language is supported through the 50/50 Spanish English Dual language model followed throughout our school. In the 
ENL model in second grade classrooms and the 12:1:1 class, the families are provided with bilingual newsletters and written 
communication. In addition to having two classroom teachers who are fluent in Spanish, the ESL teacher is NYCertified by the 
Translation & Interpretation Unit of the NYC Department of Education to assist families or school staff with interpretation or 
translation services. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Because kindergarten and first grade classrooms 50/50 dual language model, and all teachers in those grades hold a bilingual 
license, all content area instruction and the majority of enrichment activities are available in each grade. Language planning for 
different levels of acquisition are provided in all content areas.  The ENL teacher ensures all content, material, and support is 
age appropriate and on grade level in second grade. Each student is places based on age in the appropriate grade and 
resources distributed are per grade. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Because both schools have extensive afterschool programs we coordinates space to ensure all children in the building have 
access to outdoor space, the gym, auditorium, and cafeteria. The ELL coordinators of each school share test resources and 
information on compliance when needed to ensure all assessments are administered effectively. Additionally, school staff 
work to allocate resources and develop collaborative relationships with co-located school staff. We share space and resources 
as need to ensure that all of the ELLs' needs are met. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our PTA and parent coordinator provide assistance in translation and information about our school and community. These 
personnel support new students and families as they make the transition in the program. We encourage parents of 
newcomers to read in their native language to their child and provide them with instructional materials on how to prepare 
their child for the upcoming school year. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Not applicable 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We follow a 50/50 Spanish/English Dual language program.  All K classrooms and first grade 
classrooms and ICT classrooms are self contained.  Each classroom follows a side-by-side model and 
alternate language daily. All content is taught in both languages, always extending the previous day's 
lesson. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In addition to district professional development, weekly as well as monthly planning meetings are scheduled for PS 595x 
teachers and administrators. At these meetings, the ENL teachers are given the opportunity to participate in curriculum 
common planning, sharing assessment results, and discussing the needs of the ELL students in the classroom and school wide 
environment. Teachers working with ELL’s are also provided instruction in the use of Common Core curricula.  PS 595x requires 
all teachers, including those who work with ELL’s to collaborate in inquiry teams on a weekly basis. Teams work to review 
student work, improve teaching practice and integrate new strategies and concepts to support student growth. In addition, the 
school schedule allows for 80 minutes of professional development time on Monday afternoons. These PDs support teachers 
in delivering Common Core- aligned instruction by equipping each teacher with strategies, techniques and materials that we 
allow them to plan instruction that will support and meet the needs of the students. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Most of our professional development is centered around content and language development in the curriculum. Language 
development strategies and ways to be culturally inclusive to meet the various needs of our student population are more than 
80% of the activities in our annual Professional Development Plan. Agendas, notes and sign in sheets are maintained for all 
grade level planning, professional development, and outside conferences and workshops. As a dual language school, 
professional development always considers linguistic development as well as academic development. Given the above 
information we easily complete the CR Part 154 requirements for 15% of total areas for all teachers and 50% of total hours for 
bilingual/ ENL teachers to receive ELL-specific professional development. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Language interpreters are readily available at all times to translate and interpret communication. ENL and dual alnguage 
teachers are present at all IEP meetings to discuss the students' growth in all areas of the curriculum. The school has open 
school night four times a year in which the progress of the student is discuss. In addition, ENL and dual language teachers 
schedule meetings with parents of ELLs at least once per year in order to discuss students' progress.   The dual language teams 
have Spanish-speaking teachers.   We have parent workshops each month in English and Spanish, to support families better 
understanding their children's progress and providing supports to be used at home. Periodically, teachers meet with individual 
families targeting the ELL individually throughout the year during the parent engagement Tuesdays to provide targeted 
support and to discuss individual needs.  This time is also used by ENL and dual langauge teachers to conduct parent outreach, 
hold phone conferences with parents, and plan for parent meetings and events 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

During the open house, the ESL teachers inform the ELLs parents of the services they provide. We also have parent teacher 
conference four times a year, where the ENL teachers as well as the dual language teachers show progress through data and 
portfolios of student work.   Further we have monthly events in the evenings for families to gather to get to know each other 
and feel a part of the academic community. Finally, these events include Monday Morning Sing, a Carnival, a Harvest Festival, 
Movie nights in Spanish and English, and our end of the year celebrations. All events are held in Spanish and English.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, [PRINCIPAL's NAME], testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
