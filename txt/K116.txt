Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of P.S. 116 is to cultivate, nourish and enhance our students' self-image as life-long learners and to 
provide them with challenging opportunities and experiences. To achieve academic success and excellence, we 
encourage creativity and provide our students with the ability to embrace and develop a strong sense of community 
awareness and civic responsibility.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Our school serves Kindergarten through Grade 5. It is located in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The demographic diversity of our 
student body encompasses 93.85% Hispanic, 3.74% Black,1.1% Asian and 0.88% White. English Language Learners 
(ELLS) comprise 26.81% of our population, while students with disabilities (SWDs) make up 21.1%. Boys account for 
49.01% of the students enrolled, and girls account for 50.99%. The diversity of our student body is an important 
educational resource that enhances the environment for learning. 

We cultivate ‘Strong Family-Community Ties’. The school community strategically aligns professional development, 
family outreach and student learning through the collaboration of outside agencies such as NYPD (Anti-Bully 
Program), and the FDNY. Further, we share a strong partnership with the Coalition for Hispanic Family Services. They 
are a very active and integral part of our school community. They facilitate an Arts and Literacy After School Program 
for Grades K-5. This program offers students interdisciplinary exposure to music, dance, visual arts, drama, yoga, 
martial arts, creative movement, media works, and Science using the arts. The arts and literacy program helps to 
cultivate critical thinking among our students. Their curriculum builds on the interests and strengths of the students. 
The program also provides participants with homework help and art therapy. Social services are provided to families 
in need by the Coalition for Hispanic Families.  

In our continued work to maintain and establish even stronger community ties we began and will continue Tea Time 
Tuesday. This allows parents of our Kindergartens to attend morning class with their children. After class our Parent 
Coordinator escorts the parents to the cafeteria where parents are allowed the opportunity to express any concerns 
that they may have. they are also given the opportunity to contribute any information that may be helpful to us. We 
have also established a school Newsletter where we highlight our celebration and events. The Newsletter also 
provides parents and the community with other pertinent information about our school. We have an Honor Society 
that celebrate student achievement and we hold assemblies where parents can celebrate in their success.  

PS 116K will be deepening the work with TC reading and Writing curriculum using the reading and writing workshops. 
All students will be responsible for completing writing units of study and completing a writing performance task as a 
summative assessment for each unit. In addition to TC reading and Writing for English Language Arts (ELA) curriculum 
we decided that Passport Social studies would be the curriculum used for all Social Studies units. We will deepen the 
work with-in our ICT classes to support with parallel and station teaching. We will align all Social Studies units to the 
writing pacing calendar to reinforce what the students are learning in ELA and carry it over into our social Studies 
content area.  

We at P. S. 116 place a significant emphasis on the important roles that parents, families, and the community play in 
raising student performance and closing the achievement gap. We have an active PTA that engages in planning and 
facilitating educational, fun and engaging activities for students and families. They also support teachers and staff, 
fund events, organize and provide volunteer assistance when needed. We are always striving to maintain and develop 
the collaborative partnership between parents, families, the community, and the school.  

PS116K is a growing school and community of learners. We are committed to our students, parents, and teachers. We 
seek improvements in teaching and learning; we seek knowledge and reform, we sought information and researched 
based practices, and we seek and aspire to be the very best. Our students deserve no less. Our teachers and 
administrators are eager to support our students and are continuously making changes and enhancements to their 
teaching practices. We embrace diversity, respect all cultures and communities and live by our motto – AIM HIGH, DO 
YOUR BEST AND BE CARING. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

We are continuously working on providing our at-risk students with targeted assistance by using innovative practices, 
in the area of literacy focusing on getting many of our teachers trained in various intervention programs, e.g. Fountas 
and Pinnell Guided Reading and Language Power. We have also added Compass Pathblazer, a progress monitoring 
and intervention program using technology for our ELLs, Special Education students in self-contained and ICT classes 
and for RTI as well for our general education population. Additionally, we offer an after school program, Academy for 
Success, where at-risk students are provided with additional instruction in Literacy and Mathematics. This year we will 
again have a Saturday Academy. Here, our ELLs will be provided with supplementary focused instruction in the four 
language domains: listening, speaking, reading and writing. They will engage in guided practice and vibrant language 
development activities. We recognize that the consistent provision of strategic entry points into the curricula, to 
address the needs of all learners, continues to be a challenge. This is a continued area of focus.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the past year 
are: 

Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 

Supportive Environment : The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 

Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 

Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in 
school and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators 
value each other. 

Our key area of focus for this school year is: 

Rigorous Instruction : Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High 
standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing 
critical thinking skills.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. Our school's strengths relative to this Framework element: 

As reported in the 2016-2017 Quality Review, As a result of teacher teams' systemic inquiry work in six-week cycles, 
school-wide instructional coherence was evident in curricular documents across content areas and grade levels. 
Trends have shown improvement since the beginning of the school year across grade bands including kindergarten to 
grade two, where 40 percent of students showed improvement in inferring and understanding in reading and 45 
percent showed improvement in adding details to their writing. In grades three through five, 50 percent of students 
showed improvement in organizing ideas and paragraphs in writing.  

Our school's strength relative to the Framework in Rigorous Instruction has been the use of the TC running records 
that teachers use to assess the students' proficiency in Reading. According to our most recent TC data from school 
year 2017-18, 53.87% of our students in grades K-5 were reading at or above grade level.  

 

2. Our priority need that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element is: 

That all students in grades K-5 increase their reading levels/proficiency levels by 10% as evidenced by the TC running 
records in June of 2019. In order for this goal to be successful our action plan is to ensure that teachers are providing 
students with adequate reading time, interventions when needed and effective Guided Reading lessons. Teachers will 
be able to assess their students four times in the school year in order to attain the goal.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.

For the 2017-2018 school year, 53.87% of our students in grades K-5 were reading at or above grade level. By June of 
2019, there will be a 5% increase of students in grades K-5 reading at or above grade level as measured by and 
evidenced by TC running records.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. Our school's strengths relative to the Framework in Supportive Environment has been in analyzing the data found 
in our OORS reports to monitor Incidents that occur in our building and how we can make improvements via our 
monthly School Safety Committee meetings . According to our OORS report data from school year 2016-2017, 50% of 
our incidents decreased due to the fact that we combined lunch hours 12-1pm and 1-2pm. .  

 

2. The priority need that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element is that there will be 
a 20% reduction of infractions/incidents during lunch between 12-2pm as measured and evidenced by the OORS data 
reports. In order for this goal to be successful our action plan is to ensure that we continue to analyze the OORS 
reports via our School Safety meetings and by having teachers, students and staff partake of a PBIS program for 
school year 2018-2019 in order to maintain and promote academic and social/emotional growth of all students.  

 

3. The following are the policies, practices and structures which will be in place to ensure we are supporting the whole 
child: 

  As part of our PBIS program, all students will be expected to follow the STARS acronym which stands for Safe, 

Timely, Accountable, Respectful and show Self-control. These expectations will be set for the Hallways, 
Restrooms, Cafeteria, Recess, Arrival, Dismissal and Bus followed by a Matrix of Behavior Expectations. 
Teachers and staff will be able to teach, demonstrate and clarify behavioral expectations on a daily basis. 
Students will be praised and rewarded with GOTCHA tickets which they can redeem at the School Store on a 
monthly basis. Teachers and staff will also provide students with timely, consistent consequences for 
misbehavior followed by immediate parent contact of unacceptable behavior.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Our school's strengths relative to the Framework in Collaborative Teachers lies in professional collaborations, which 
strengthens our teachers' instructional capacity, contribute to school-wide coherence and result in effective 
classroom practices as referenced in the 2016-2017 Quality Review Preliminary Report. According to a well-developed 
rating in quality indicator 4.2: Teacher teams and leadership development was one of our highlights and a Common 
Planning Opportunity was developed this school year, 2017-2018. This CPO time has allowed teachers to collaborate 
and participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement.  

 

2. The priority need that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element is that there will be 
an increase of 7% in English proficiency as measured by the listening and speaking component of the NYSESLAT. In 
order to attain this increase our teachers have focused on collaboration and on quality professional learning 
opportunities that are centered around student learning hoping to see an additional improvement on the NYSESLAT.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Our school's strengths relative to the Framework in Strong Family and Community Ties is to attain an increase in 
the percentage of parent participation at our school workshops/engagement time as measured by our parent 
workshop attendance.  
 

 

2. The priority need that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element is that there will be 
an increase of 10% of parent participation at our school workshops/engagement time. We are constantly striving to 
maintain and develop the collaborative partnership between parents, families, the community and the school. Our 
rapport with parents over the years has increased due to the fact that parents have stated that the school staff works 
hard to build trusting relationships with them via school workshops/engagement time, Tea Time for our Kindergarten 
parents, Writing and Math celebrations for all grades K-5 classes, Student of Month assemblies, monthly Parent 
Workshops, monthly PTA meetings, etc.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
For the 2017-2018 school year, 7.6% of parents attended workshops/parent opportunities as measured by our parent 
workshop attendance. By June of 2019, there will be a 10% increase in the percentage of parent participation at our 
school workshops/engagement time as measured by our parent workshop attendance and evidenced by the feedback 
provided to us from parent reflection sheets.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
Assisting preschool children from early childhood to the elementary school program involves the following: 

● Flyers are sent to parents introducing the school and announcing registration 

● School tours are facilitated in the Spring 

● A parent orientation is held. It provides parents and guardians with valuable information that will help  

them support their child's transition into elementary school 

● During orientation a preparatory packet is provided for the students. The packet includes a Leap Frog  

Letter Factory DVD, a book of learning activities and preparative worksheets 

● A mailed envelope is sent to parents. It includes a welcoming letter informing the parents/guardians of  

the first day of school procedures, their child’s assigned class and ID name tags 

● Routines that children will use during the year are established, ex. Where children will be picked up at the  

end of the day, where children will eat lunch, etc.  

● Core Knowledge literacy program is utilized in Kindergarten to provide children with the background  

knowledge and skills they need for listening, speaking, reading and writing

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Administrators and teachers meet together to discuss the appropriate multiple assessments used in school. 
Professional Development is provided by Administrators and Lead Teachers on how to use assessments correctly. We 
collect and collaborate to analyze assessments. Common findings are noted. A memorandum is sent to teachers 
informing them about the results and instructing them to put into practice specific suggestions resulting from the 
common findings. Also, professional learning opportunities are offered to support the understanding, sharing, 
reviewing and analyzing of data. Through this, students can be targeted for intervention and curriculum can be 
revised to implement strategic tasks, benchmarks and outcomes. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 116 Elizabeth L. Farrell, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy 
to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S. 116 Elizabeth L. Farrell will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

The Supervisor is needed to supervise the TitleIII program because it is the Sole program in the 
school  on Saturdays. 
 
Supplies and Materials: Language Power supplemented with NYSESLAT Test Material: All 
supplies and materials used will come out of Fair Student Funding, which is at no cost to Title III 
money.  Students will also be exposed to art taught by a licensed art teacher. 
                        
                                                
The following proficiency level ELLs are targeted, Entering, Emerging, Expanding and 
Transitioning. The above mentioned four classes will be taught by certified ENL teachers. The 
one content area teacher we have included is art. The art teacher will work with the ELL groups

1/4 of the time each Saturday.  Art will be implemented to each class of the 4 classes.  To 
continuously maintain quality and interest of students attending the Saturday Academy we 
decided to incorporate the  arts curriculum  . Each ENL class will have an hour of art and thus 
provide planning time for teachers as well during that time. 
  
Language of instruction will be in English. Five certified teachers will be utilized, four ENL 
teachers and one art teacher.  Language Power, a flexible and portable program will address 
unique challenges that English language learners are faced with.  This highly differentiated and 
rich instruction resource is anchored by a dynamic, level-appropriate text set that provides 
rigorous instruction in the four language domains: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The 
NYSESLAT books will be purchased for Grades 2-5 for students attending the academy as an 
extra resource. Teachers will have access to AWARD READING,  an on-line resources as well 
as the physical materials to use with our ELLs. Engage NY will also be used for instructional 
lessons and standard based targets of measurement in the 4 components: Listening, Speaking, 
Reading and Writing. 
  
During the academy, 3 hours will be focused on ELA/ENL instruction such as guided reading, 
writing (across content areas) as well as address the use of language.  One hour will be used for 
the arts to be incorporated into the ENL program. The ENL teacher will co-teach with the art 
teacher to support vocabulary and accountable talk.  Each class wil be scheduled in hourly 
intervals: 8:30-9:30,  9:30-10:30,  10:30-11:30,  11:30-12:30. 
  
Saturday Academy teachers will have data regarding the students reading levels and will work on 
strategies that will help them to become better readers. All four modalities will be integrated into 
every content area for best practices. ENL teachers will work on modalities that students are 
weak in, they will use the RLAT/ITEL/EDAT/NYSESLAT data provided to them. 
  
Guided Reading will be done in groups of 5/6 students for grades 1-5,  in 25-30 minute intervals, 
while that is going on students will be given time to read independently to increase stamina 
and/or other activities that include writing, use of technology, and not limited to other content 
areas.  
 
The school will maintain records of student attendance each week on a school created attendance 
sheet which will be kept centralized in a binder in the main office.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The 2016-2017 New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) results revealed 
that:  22 NYSESLAT test takers advanced 1 proficiency level 
 6 NYSESLAT test takers advanced 2 proficiency levels 
0 NYSESLAT test takers advanced 3 proficiency levels 
0 NYSESLAT test takers advanced 4 levels 
34 NYSESLAT test takers remained at the same proficiency level 
11 NYSESLAT test takers regressed i proficiency level 
1 NYSESLAT test taker regressed 2 proficiency level 
0 NYSESLAT test taker regressed 3 proficiency levels

0 NYSESLAT test takers regressed 4 proficiency levels 
Estrellita, TCRWP ELL Fall and Spring Assessments, and HLA are  being used to guide instructional planning for our ELLs.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ENL committee meets monthly to access and monitor ELL progress.  In addition, Inquiry teams meet weekly to evaluate 
student work as well as teachers meeting during common planning time to look at formal and informal assessment data to 
plan , modify or adjust curriculum.  Two integrated ENL providers will provide additional support.. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We have evaluated the success of our ENL programs using  the ELL Data Analysis tool, as well as looking at data from our 
School Quality Guide and snapshot along with our  TC Running records.  We look at the progress and the number of ELLs that 
are reading at or above grade level.  The results of the 2016 NYSESLAT indicate that the modality of need is the writing 
modality. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Collaborative Planning Opportunities (CPOs), Common planning periods and Inquiry team meetings have been embedded in 
the teaching schedule which allow for all teachers to meet and discuss the interventions in place and the impact they are 
having on student performance.  Both formal and informal data is used to measure student progress and adjustments are 
made according to need.  Teacher teams gather data from the ELL Data Analysis Tool, RLAT, TC assessment, ELL Fall and Spring 
benchmark reports among other school created assessment throughout the year.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Teachers will be using TCRR data, Unit assessments and other forms of checks for understanding as comprehension checks. For 
Math it would be Higher Order Thinking (H.O.T.) questions and Chapter and Unit assessments, other forms of checks for 
understandings will be used. We provide our at-risk students with targeted assistance by using innovative practices in the area 
of literacy.  Our classroom teachers will continually differentiate and create groupings in the classroom to provide support for 
the ‘at-risk’ students as well as intervention.  Tier 1 is the instructional core that is intended to incorporate high quality 
evidence-based instruction for all students. This includes instruction that has been shown to be effective for ELLs, and 
differentiation to meet students’ diverse needs. Instruction for ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1 
instructional level. Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive academic 
support. This extra support can occur in the classroom, but also in separate settings with instruction focused on specific 
learning targets. Tier 2 and Tier 3 instruction should also be tailored to meet ELLs’ language needs and should be incorporated 
into research-based intervention strategies. 
Two Academic Intervention Services (AIS ) teachers provide targeted instruction to grades 3-5. Ongoing Assessment data is 
reviewed to identify areas of academic needs and growth.  According to assessment results, students may exit from AIS or 
additional students may be provided AIS.  Students are bench marked every six weeks.  In addition , our teachers will provide 
more differentiated instruction in the classroom .   We have an after school program for grades 3-5 at-risk students. and a 
Saturday Academy providing instruction for ELLs from 2-5. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The 2016-2017 New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) results revealed:  22 NYSESLAT test 
takers advanced 1 proficiency level 
 6 NYSESLAT test takers advanced 2 proficiency levels 
0 NYSESLAT test takers advanced 3 proficiency levels 
0 NYSESLAT test takers advanced 4 levels 
34 NYSESLAT test takers remained at the same proficiency level 
11 NYSESLAT test takers regressed i proficiency level 
1 NYSESLAT test taker regressed 2 proficiency level 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

0 NYSESLAT test taker regressed 3 proficiency levels

NYSESLAT data also indicates the writing modality is an area of need in grades 2 through 5.  The highest number of students in 
grade 2 scored low in the writing modality.  In grade 1 the highest number of students scored low in the speaking modality.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In October, each teacher is given  a copy of the NYSESLAT Modality Analysis report as well as access to the EDAT. Results from 
assessment data, both formal and informal, are reviewed and shared with our teachers during professional learning 
opportunities weekly.  This information is also disseminated during Inquiry Team meetings and common planning periods so 
that adjustments are made to our programs to meet the needs of our students.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We have dual certified teachers who are certified in ENL and general education throughout grade 2-5.  In those 
classrooms instruction is delivered in English and ELLs are serviced in small group instruction for the required time 
based on their English proficiency level in all modalities, speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  We also offer 
integrated and stand-alone ENL instruction to those classes with our two ENL certified teachers.  For our ELL students 
in special education our two ENL certified teachers provide ENL instruction using the integrated and stand-alone 
model. Stand-alone ENL instruction is provided to students to ensure students acquire the English language needed 
for success in core content courses.  Integrated ENL provide students instruction in the core content area (i.e., English 
language arts, math, science and social studies) and English language development instruction from a dually certified 
teacher or two certified teachers.   
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A Program is not offered at the moment. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Our Kindergarten and Grade one Dual Language program are self-contained each taught by one teacher who has dual 
certification.   English proficient (EPs) and ELLs are taught together throughout the day.  Core content areas are taught 
in both English and Spanish.  Instruction will be given in both languages alternating on a weekly basis, one week all 
Spanish instruction followed by the next week all  English instruction. 'Wonders' published by McGraw Hill Education 
and Estrellita  are the literacy programs used to build literacy skills in both English and Spanish.      

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

  .  
Our self-contained students receive the maximum number of ELL requirements and more during the day. Our push-in/pull-out 
ESL teachers provide all required units of ENL periods to our ELLs.  For Entering, Emerging and Transitional students we provide 
2 units (360 minutes of ENL instruction.) For our Transitional  and Expanding students we provide 180 minutes of ENL 
instruction. For our Commanding students we provide 90 minutes of ENL instruction. Sessions are made-up if and/or teachers 
or students are absent to adhere to all CR-Part 154 regulations. Former ELLs, as mandated by the CR-Part 154 part II, will be 
serviced 90 minutes a week for two years after achieving the Commanding level.  
 
In our free standing  ENL classrooms  instruction is delivered in English and ELLs are serviced in small group instruction for the 
required time based on their English proficiency level in all modalities, speaking, listening, reading, and writing.  We also offer 
push in ENL instruction to those classes with our two ENL certified teachers.  For our ELL students in special education our two 
ENL certified teachers provide ENL instruction using the push in and pull out model.For Entering, Emerging and Transitional 
students we provide 2 units (360 minutes of ENL instruction.) For our Transitional  and Expanding students we provide 180 
minutes of ENL instruction. For our Commanding students we provide 90 minutes of ENL instruction. Sessions are made-up if 
and/or teachers or students are absent to adhere to all CR-Part 154 regulations. Former ELLs, as mandated by the CR-Part 154 
part II, will be serviced 90 minutes a week for two years after achieving the Commanding level.   
 
 
Our Kindergarten and Grade one Dual Language program are self-contained each taught by one teacher who has dual 
certification.   English proficient (EPs) and ELLs are taught together throughout the day.  Core content areas are taught in both 
English and Spanish.  Instruction will be given in both languages alternating on a daily basis, one day all Spanish instruction 
followed by the next day all  English instruction. For Entering, Emerging and Transitional students we provide 2 units (360 
minutes of ENL instruction.) For our Transitional  and Expanding students we provide 180 minutes of ENL instruction. For our 
Commanding students we provide 90 minutes of ENL instruction. Sessions are made-up if and/or teachers or students are 
absent to adhere to all CR-Part 154 regulations. Former ELLs, as mandated by the CR-Part 154 part II, will be serviced 
90 minutes a week for two years after achieving the Commanding level.   
 
In order to ensure that ELLs receive their full compliment of of ENL,ELA and HLA mandated  units, the administration 
strategically program students so that teacher time is maximized in the classroom engaged in providing instruction.  Lesson 
plans and teacher programs indicate ENL, ELA and HLA mandated units.  During classroom visits and formal/informal 
observations, supervisors check for the proper program implementation.                    
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Content areas such as Science and Social Studies are taught in English using ESL approaches such as scaffolds and other 
instructional support. 
 
  In our Dual Language classrooms, teachers use Passport when teaching in Social Studies in English and Harcourt when 
teaching in Spanish to support our native spanish speakers. 
 
  When teaching Science we use the Harcourt curriculum for grades 3-5,  FOSS is used for grades K-2.  
 
Our Dual Language classes will also Harcourt Science curriculum in Spanish.  
 
 Teachers also provide additional opportunities and materials to foster oral language development and to assist students in 
achieving proficiency in English with a focus on Principle 4: Explicit English as a New Language (ENL) and English Language Arts 
(ELA). 
 
Learning experiences are made comprehensible for students through specific pedagogical techniques.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

  
With a focus of UDL and DOK, utilized in lesson plans we ensure that the CCLS are addressed through ESL methodology such as 
providing multiple approaches in the process of thinking, teaching, and learning concepts.  These strategies also enable ELLs in 
understanding the critical features that define a particular concept and distinguish if from other concepts.  Students are taught 
questioning techniques which are at the heart of the CCLS and they are essential for any 21st century classroom. One of our 
teachers' goals is to foster ELLs to become more active rather than passive learners and help promote academic language in 
the process. 
  
Our ELLS will continue to receive after-school program instruction and provide them with additional ESL academic intervention 
services.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

 We ensure that ELLs are evaluated in their Native Languages by using their Home Language Survey. Students eligible for the 
NYSITELL are administered the Spanish Lab to determine their proficiency in their native language. Our students are serviced 
both in a stand alone and integrated settings..  Students in our Dual Language classes will be evaluated in both Spanish and 
English in all content areas to access and evaluate growth in the home languages.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a)  We currently have 2 SIFE students and they are placed in self-contained ENL classrooms where they get their 2 units of 
instruction. In addition, the student is serviced by the ESL teacher for Tier II/III intervention as well. 
They will be working with the ESL teacher (pull-out) in a small group setting as well as intervention with extended day, 
Saturday Academy and support from the Arts & Literacy Program.  These children are currently attending after-school and any 
other programs that we might have available to them including the Saturday Academy and all enrichment programs.  
  
b) For our ELLS that have been identified as newcomers (1-3 years), we offer Spanish speaking students our Dual 
Language program  if available in their grade and/or placed them in the self-contained or designated ENL classroom, where the 
ESL teachers push-in to provide extra support. Our ELLs are offered extended day, after-school, and the Saturday Academy as 
well as all enrichment activities. The teacher and the ESL push-in provide small group instruction. The coache will provide 
teachers with additional support to improve instructional practices to better serve our students. The school, in a joint effort to 
best support our students, has partnered with the Arts & Literacy Program to provide more support for our lowest-third 
population including our ELLs with college students to provide that extra support during extended day as well as after-school 
and the Saturday Academy. 
  
c) For our ELLs that have been identified as 4-6 years, we file for extension of services as well placing them in the ENL classes. 
The ESL teacher provides push-in/pull-out support. These children are offered extended day, Saturday Academy as well as 
after-school. The teachers and the push-in/pull-out provider will provide small group instruction. 
  
d)We have identified 0 students as long-term ELLs.  
  
e) As mandated by the CR-Part 154 all former ELLS will be serviced within the classrooms using the push-in/pull-out model, 
instruction given through the content areas and/or ELA. They are serviced 90 minutes per week. Scheduling will be flexible. 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

Instructional strategies that our teachers incorporate are based on the Danielson Framework addressing the CCLS. 
Strategies that teachers use are based on the following research as well; Universal Design Learning Framework and Depth of 
Knowledge. Teaching English language learners to be successful writers depends on the quality of the instructional process, 
practices, and classroom climate for learning. Research suggests two principles of writing instruction for ELLs. First, literacy 
instruction should center on understanding and on the communication of meaning. The teachers' role is to support students as 
they carry out meaningful literacy activities involving the full processes of reading and writing. Second, writing instruction 
should take place in the context of a rich and challenging curriculum. The teacher's' role is to provide instructional materials 
and activities that meet and challenge a student's language production level and provide access to standards-based academic 
content.  Below are some of the practices implemented and beliefs held at our school which are part of ELL instruction:  
 
  
1.  Explicit instruction in writing mechanics and composition skills is necessary for writing success. 
2.  Vocabulary and oral language development are an integral part of writing. 
3.  Writing flourishes in a safe community of learners, where teacher and students are writing and sharing their writings, 
editing peer work (students edit teacher's writing also), and where they publish together. ELLs need a sense of community and 
structure that allows them to take risks on their way to learning in a new language and culture. 
4.  Using culturally responsive instruction, teachers explore with their classes the ways in which students and their families use 
literacy at home and in the community. Teachers then bring these topics, styles, and cultural knowledge into the writing 
themes.  
5.  We use cooperative learning during the planning, revising, and editing of their writing, so that students give feedback to 
one another as well as use feedback that has been given. ELLs learn a great deal just from examining peer  writing. Through 
this process, ELLs have many opportunities to write, learn new text structures and words, and become familiar with the 
mechanics of writing in English.English language learners (ELLs) often have problems mastering science, math, or social studies 
concepts because they cannot comprehend the textbooks for these subjects. ELLs at all levels of English proficiency, and 
literacy, will benefit from 
explicit instruction of comprehension skills along with other skills. 
6.  We incorporate the teaching academic vocabulary throughout the content areas. For English language learners (ELLs), 
vocabulary development is especially critical for their ability to read and comprehend texts. The selection of vocabulary words 
to teach ELLs can be grouped into three tiers. Vocabulary instruction is essential to effective math instruction. Not only does it 
include teaching math-specific terms such as "percent" or "decimal," but it also includes understanding the difference between 
the mathematical definition of a word and other definitions of that word.

Using technology: Technology can also be a powerful tool in math instruction for ENLs as well as other content areas. Our 
school has access to Destination Math, Soar to Success and the Go Math technology. 
  
To provide access to rich academic content areas and to accelerate their English Language Develop, PS 116 is using the 
following: internet based resources:  BrainPop, World Encyclopedia,   A Science Lab has been installed at PS 116 to increase 
student interest as well as to cultivate a culture of scientific learning. Houghton Mifflin Social Studies was purchased for grades 
K-5. The Go Math program will incorporate 
a technology component that will enable ENLs with more visuals as well as technology exposure.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 
PS 116 uses curriculuar, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of our ELLs-SWDs within the least 
restrictive environment by allowing teachers to adjust their curriculum through scaffolding, differentiation (group-work). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

 
The  ENL certified teachers collaborate with classroom teacher of ELL-SWD students to adjust schedule as needed to provide 
services for students based on their academic and English proficiency. 
 
Students who qualify for flexible scheduling are receiving instruction in core subjects in either an ICT setting or a general 
Education setting. 
 
   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
One of the improvements we continue to make is increased professional development for all teachers and personnel working 
with ELLs. In these sessions teachers will  analyze data from the NYSESLAT, EDAT, ELA, Math, and Science (if applicable), from 
their own students. The data analyzed from the RLAT will be based on modalites. Teachers will  target those weaknesses or 
strengths. For the MATH/ELA the Item Analysis that the city provides will be utilized to address specific strands and/or 
standards to best provide the intervention the child needs. Formal and informal assessments will be used as well. Inquiry 
Teams will be utilized to analyze student work to continually adjust lessons and improve instructional practices.  BrainPop is 
also another technology website that our teachers use often to enhance student understanding.   Students will be given 
choices to work in groups therefore, allowing our ELLs to work with other students to increase their verbal and listening skills. 
Students are also given opportunities to present their work to their fellow classmates. Other internet based materials such as 
our Go Math and Pathblazer  will be used as a resource for our students. To continuously align and improve our Social Studies 
curriculum, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, will remain as our Social Studies Curriculum for K-5 since it has a Spanish component 
included in its curriculum. These textbooks are aligned to the New York City Performance Standards as well as address parts of 
CCLS and the City-Wide expectations. Pedagogues will enhance the Science and Social Studies through hands-on as well as the 
use of technology using sites such as BrainPop and the World Book Encyclopedia. 
  
Addressing the Danielson Framework as well as differentiating through different entry points will enable every child to learn. 
Curricula that have been adapted will be monitored closely and implementation of Danielson framework is addressed through 
CCLS. Academic vocabulary is embedded in the new curricula which will be strengthened through word walls, writing, 
accountable talks, etc. 
  
Our ELLs participate in enrichment programs and activities such as Technology Club,  and Science Club, Extended day, after 
school and Saturday Academy as well as all enrichment programs offered schoolwide. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    
Fundations for K-2, TC Reading and Writing bundles using the workshop model are being implemented for K-5. in the 
upcoming school year. Another new program is Passport for Social Studies for grades K-5.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have closed our Transitional Bilingual program in Kindergarten and have replaced it with a Spanish/English Dual 
language Program in Kindergarten and Grade one in response to our parent interest and choice. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We offer Saturday ELL Academy, Arts & Literacy, and Title I Afterschool programs to our ELLs. The Arts & Literacy is offered for 
the whole school, from the outside. Our students get priority. For the Saturday and Title I Afterschool program all ELLs are 
invited with letters. These programs offer ELA and Math support. The Arts & Literacy provides homework help as well as 
counseling through the arts.  All extra curricular activities include the classes as a whole so no one ELL is left out of any of the 
programs that are provided.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
The instructional materials that are used to support our ELLs are Teachers' College Reading and Writing Curriculum grades K-5 
and FOCUS (skill-based) reading materials that K-5 classrooms have for differentiation for our ELLs. We also have a Fundations 
program to support phonics and basic language skills. Language Power is another supplemental instructional technology 
program used for our entire ENL population to support them in all levels of English proficiency.  All classes have been provided 
with leveled libraries in English. Passport Social Studies curriculum materials are based on leveled libraries in English and 
textbooks have been ordered in English (Spanish content dictionaries are available). The Science program is provided in English 
and Spanish to all students using Harcourt (grades 3-5) and FOSS (grades K-2). In Math we have adopted the Go Math program 
that is available in English and Spanish and also has an online component. 
  
Our plan for the 31 ENLs, who have received ESL services 4-6 years, are to continuously offer them extended day, afterschool 
programs funded Title I and Title III, as well as any extra curricular offerings. These children continue to receive ESL services.  
BrainPop, Pathblazer and GoMath - offer online components that are readily available for our ELLs. 
  
The language goals of students with IEPS state that students will acquire language proficiency through ESL methodologies. 
Running Records and Interim Assessments, are used for differentiated instruction. Teacher assessments, portfolios, student 
observations and Teachers' College Unit Assessments are all formal and informal assessments the school uses to identify and 
strengthen the needs of our ENL/SWD students.  31 students identified as having special needs appear to have difficulties 
acquiring the new language (English) due to their disabilities. We have self-contained, ICT and ICT  push-in/pull-out programs 
to accommodate our parents’ choices. We continually have PPT (Pupil Personnel Team), School Leadership Team, Study 
groups, Inquiry-based, ENL and Cabinet meetings to update any and all information regarding our student body. In these 
meetings teachers are invited to attend if the need arises and teachers are constantly collaborating with one another to 
identify and meet the needs of the students. 
  
Any student that has been recommended for services such as SETSS (English/Spanish), counseling, speech therapy 
(English/Spanish), and occupational therapy is receiving the services stated in their IEP and/or Personal Intervention Plan. 
Service providers have materials available to them in the Literacy Resource Room such as leveled libraries in English and 
Spanish. These providers are also welcome to the resources that classroom teachers have available. 
  
Continued professional development for personnel working with ELLs is on-going and our administration visits classrooms to 
offer feedback and solutions to increase teacher output daily. In these sessions teachers will be analyzing data for their own 
students from  the NYSESLAT, EDAT, ELA, Math, and Science (if applicable). Implementation of Performance Series assessments 
will also be included. We also utilize internet based programs such as Award Reading, BrainPop, Pathblazer, and GoMath. As 
part of our initiative to further align and improve student progress, we have purchased ipads for the classrooms. We also 
have a class set of laptops in our science lab and a class set of laptops in our library as well as five laptops in each 
classroom.  To increase reading motivation as well as exposure to technology, ebooks and Apps (applications) will be 
purchased using software monies that have been allocated. 
  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support in our ENL classrooms and Dual Language programs is systemic and is not limited to the 
the ENL and Dual Language classrooms.  In addition to glossaries, dictionaries and materials in the home languages are offered 
to help support our ELLS.  In addition, available school personnel are utilized to provide clarification for ELLS (in their home 
languages) during the school day.  This extra support is given to those students who may be struggling with content and 
concepts in their subject-area classes.  Teachers also group students of the same language for certain activities so that they can 
assist each other and respond in their home language.  We extend these strategies to our after school and Saturday programs.. 
 
 
In order to address critical needs, our ELL's in ENL and DL classrooms have Spanish libraries. Our ENL teachers and some of the 
classroom teachers will provide the native language support when necessary. Especially during math. We have GoMath and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

reading libraries in Spanish available. The breakdown of ENL minutes of instruction is 360 minutes of ENL instruction 
for Beginners, Entering and Emerging students, 180 minutes of ENL instruction for Emerging, Transitioning and 
Expanding students and 90 minutes of ENL instruction for our Commanding students. Classroom teachers use the Teachers' 
College program  differentiated with ELL methodologies. Teachers have initiated a 50/50 library with fiction and non-fiction 
and TC libraries in both English/Spanish will be used as a supplemental resource. K-5 classrooms have leveled libraries in  Social 
Studies and we have Science libraries in Spanish as well as English. We also have some books in Spanish available in Room 401. 
The Sciences are taught by the classroom teachers using the state curriculum and our cluster science teacher, who is licensed 
in Bilingual (Spanish) provides support for our ELL's when necessary. There are one to one dictionary translations available as a 
resource.  
  
We provide English Language Learners, as well as other students, with supplemental instruction 2 days after school. The 
classroom size will be no larger than 15 students from grades 2-5 in support of ELA and Math.  Certified bilingual, ESL, and Gen. 
Ed. teachers will teach this program. This program will target all eligible 2-5 grade students including the ELL students, 
approximately 120 students, in our school. There will also be a Saturday Academy offered to all ELLs from 8:30am-12:30pm in 
grades 2 through 5. It will assist in meeting the New York State Education Department standards in English, Math, Science, and 
Social Studies. ELL students will receive standards based instruction  for three hours in ESL and content area instruction. 
Instruction will prepare students for the NYSESLAT/ELA/Math and content area assessments.  Materials will include, but 
are not limited to, authentic use of technology, periodicals, newspapers, scientific journals, and other ESL instructional 
materials for literacy and content area instruction.  Also used is Language Power and Engage NY for past New York State test 
practice. 
  
PS 116 offers professional development in various areas. For example reading, math, content area instruction, and data driven 
instruction. Our school has integrated into our mandated professional development various workshops geared to the ELL 
population of our school. Our teachers will attend workshops provided from the CFN, NYCDOE and in-house with regards to 
our ENLs, presenting the latest research as well as aligning ENL standards to CCLS.  
  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services and resources are age and grade appropriate. Teachers differentiate materials which are not 
aligned according to the needs of the students.  Selected members of the Language Allocation Team regularly meet to review 
student assessment data and ensure that all required services/resources are being delivered to support our ELLs  and are 
age/grade appropriate for each student. We also review the CCLS standards for each grade level and align those to our 
instruction. 
 
Administrators ensure all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels by performing 
formal and informal observations of teacher practice using the Danielson Framework for Teaching along with providing the 
appropriate minutes of ENL instruction based on their English Proficiency level. 
 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 
We are a stand alone school and do not share our building with other schools. 
  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the school year, newly enrolled ELL families attend workshops given by our Parent Coordinator and our ENL teachers 
(Ms. Rosario and Ms. Davila) who explain our programs and our teaching methods.  The students are also interviewed by an 
ENL certified teacher who gets to know them while assessing their knowledge of English.  Newly enrolled students are paired 
up with buddies during the school day to help them transition to the school. The parent coordinator also provides  workshops 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

 

for parents as well as students to attend to better immerse themselves in the community. They are also afforded a meet and 
greet with teachers at their first attendance day to lower their affective filters. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our ELLs are not offered language electives  as we are an elementary school. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Our Kindergarten and Grade one Dual Language programs are self-contained taught br one teacher who 
is certified.  EPs and ELLs are taught together throughout the day.  Core content areas are taught in both 
English and Spanish.  Instruction will be given in both languages alternating on a daily basis, one day all 
day Spanish instruction followed by the next day all day English instruction.  Both languages are taught 
simultaneously.         
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our Professional Development Plan is designed to enable all ENL/bilingual teachers and classroom/content-area teachers to 
support ELLs in the development of academic language and the delivery of instruction using ENL methodologies to scaffold 
understanding,  Non-pedagogical staff such as secretaries and school aides are also included in our PD plan so that they are 
presented with strategies which will assist them in communicating with our parents and students whose home language is 
other than English. 
 
As per CR Part 80, a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers is 
dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and 
content instruction for English language learners.  All our bilingual and ENL teachers will receive a minimum of fifty (50%) of 
the required professional development hours dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area 
instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
English language learners.  Our professional development plan also includes the above percentages, as prescribed by CR Part 
80, to the required 175 hours of new teacher training.    
 
PS 116 offers on going professional development in various areas. For example, reading, math, and content area instruction. 
Our school has integrated into our mandated professional development various workshops geared to the ELL population of our 
school.

  Thiis is on-going through-out the year. All staff members are invited to attend, including but not limited to our 
paraprofessionals, service providers, and guidance counselors. ENL teachers are sent  to CR-Part 154, NYSESLAT Updates and 
other related ENL PLO's and turnkey pertinent information. Our ELL Coordinators  present the EDAT and how best to use this 
data to address student needs. She also presents workshops  on the use of NYSESLAT Data. Our Coaches address the Danielson 
framework with our teachers of ELLs. During inquiry our ENL teachers meet at least twice a month to address student data. 
The Coaches and ENL teachers  provide other professional learning opportunities based on needs of our ELLs through-out the 
year such as Language Development, and the Stages of Writing.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 As per CR Part 154, a minimum of fifteen percent (15%) of the required professional development hours for all teachers is 
dedicated to language acquisition, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and 
content instruction for English language learners.  All our bilingual and ENL teachers will receive a minimum of fifty (50%) of 
the required professional development hours dedicated to language acquisition in alignment with core content area 
instruction, including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for 
English language learners.  Our professional development plan also applies the above percentages, as prescribed by CR Part 
154, to the required 175 hours of new teacher training.    
 
Records of all professional development activities are kept in binders in the administration's office.  Each professional

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Under the new provisions for parental involvement during the Tuesdays, our ENL teachers have called their perspective ELL 
students to discuss progress with parents as well as their language development. We sent home their NYSESLAT assessment 
levels at the beginning of the year and parents are afforded the opportunity to make appointments if they have any concerns. 
Tuesdays are allocated for  parental contact and our ENL teachers keep a log of all parental engagement that occurs during 
that time. Teachers make sure to schedule an annual meeting with each parent which is in a log. They may receive notes and 
progress reports throughout the year from the ENL teachers. Phone calls are utilized as a form of contact as well. 
Teachers are aware of Translation Units’ services’; teachers also request assistance from the paraprofessionals and/or other 
teacher’s for translation needs. This also includes the parent coordinator as well as our school aides.

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
We are incorporating the arts into our curriculum such as music, theater, drama, visual arts and technology.  Research has shown 
that these types of programs help all students but particularly ENL and SWD's.  They help with language aquisition and speaking 
and listening skills.  We already have a state of the art visual arts program taught by a certified arts teacher, as well as a science

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Antoinette Tucci, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written and 
oral communication is derived from the HLIS. This report includes an interview that is given to both students and 
parents to assess their preferred and dominant language.. An ATS report is also printed to identify the different 
languages spoken in our school community. Our parent coordinator, who is bilingual, is called to translate 
whenever there is a need for translation in Spanish since this is one of our school's dominant language. The parent 
coordinator will make appointments to accommodate parents that need a translator to communicate with the 
teachers as well as our paraprofessionals. Documents are translated by school staff during non-school hours from 
English to Spanish to ensure that information is effectively communicated and understood by parents. We also 
use the Translation Unit when needed for other languages such as Chinese. Parents receive information in their 
native language in a timely manner whenever notifications are sent home. ATS reports of preferred languages are 
printed by our school. More collective data from HLIS will be used this school year as well as parent surveys which 
are provided in both English and Spanish.

Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

All staff members will receive training on the language access requirements contained in Chancellor's Regulation A-
663. This training will take place during Monday Professional Learning Opportunities. Non teaching staff members will 
be trained during scheduled meetings throughout the year. The parent coordinator and other key school-based 
personnel will attend periodic training on the language access requirements contained in the regulation as well as 
resources available to support these requirements. These staff members will turnkey this information at Professional 
Learning Opportunities and staff meetings.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school will translate any and all documents that need to be translated to communicate effectively with parents. 
School staff will provide oral and written translation in-house and/or parent volunteers to those who need such 
translation services. Our school will provide translation and interpretation services in the appropriate covered 
languages, and instructions on how to obtain such services. In the main office, our school has posted the languages 
that are covered and a copy of such written notification can be obtained in the main office. Our school safety plan 
contains procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language assistance services are not prevented from 
reaching the school’s administrative office solely due to language barrier. We have in-house staff to provide both 
written and oral translation when needed. Our school population has more than 10% of parents that speak a language 
other than English. We use the translated documents that the DOE provides and all other documents that go home 
will be translated in house, in both English/Spanish. If their is a need to translate into Chinese, we will use the 
Translation Units' services. 
As per the Chancellor’s Regulation, translation posters and cards are conspicuously posted throughout the building. In 
addition, key personnel, including the Guidance Counselor, the Parent Coordinator, the PTA, the Main Office and the 
Security Agent have the translation card and are able to afford parents the opportunity to use the over-the-phone 
translation service, as indicated on the card. 
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parental surveys will be given to gather feedback on the equality and availability of translation services. The parent 
coordinator is a vehicle in which we use to gather feedback. The parental surveys are another way for collection of 
concerns with regards to the quality and availability of translation services that our school provides. We review this 
feedback and try to incorporate ways that parents feel supported and inclusive in our school. For instance, we started 
creating and sharing a monthly school newsletter that is offered in both Spanish and English. We also have students 
translate information into their home language when presenting to parents at school celebrations such as ceremonies 
and classroom celebrations of student work.
