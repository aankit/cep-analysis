Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of McKee is to prepare our students to face and address the increasingly demanding technological, 
environmental, and energy challenges of the 21st century. Members of the school community will achieve this 
mission by supporting our students to develop and refine the critical thinking, communication, scientific reasoning 
and collaborative problem-solving skills necessary to succeed in college and the workforce. 

In order to meet the challenges of a global community, we seek to increase equity, inclusion, and digital citizenship. 
This will be accomplished in several ways. Members of the school community will attend professional development

sessions, and turnkey practices aligned with research based strategies from Advancement Via Individual 
Determination (AVID) via subject area learning teams; McKee Informational Technology (MITS) team members, and 
teacher leaders. We will share best practices of actively using technology and customizing methodologies to meet 
student learning needs. 

We at McKee will leverage organizational through such supports as the School Leadership team, the professional 
capacity of teachers, and staff, family engagement, and through the effective administrative and operations of the 
school. We, as members of the school community, will model the desired behavior of promoting equity and cultural 
responsiveness, subjecting every part of the school environment to improvement, as we strive to remain true to the 
school's vision of striving to provide wrap around services to support student achievement in college, career or life.

"employability" skills by participating in internships. The internships are through the Work Based Learning Initiative 
sponsored by the New York City Department of Education:  

Ralph R. McKee Career and Technical Education High School (McKee) has a partnership with the following 
organizations to support college and career readiness: Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), 30,000 
Degrees, St. John's University (Staten Island Campus), New York Center for Interpersonal Development (NYCID), 
United Activities Unlimited, Peer Group Connection (PGC), Algebra for All, AP for All, College Access For All (CA4A), 
and CSI Liberty Partnership. McKee High School worked collaboratively with the following entities.  

1) Path training sessions that are part of Advancement of Individual Determination (AVID). 

2) Advance Placement for All, we added a new test in 2017-2018: AP for United States History. We are working on the 
curriculum to add AP Capstone in school year 2019-2020. 

3) In College Access for All (CA4A), we infused college and career readiness content and principles starting in the 9th 
grade. We also provided support to the seniors with senior Guidance Counselor, Brianne Hannafey, expanding the 
range of applications and scholarship awareness. 

4) We used the services of the Community Based Organization, New York Center for Interpersonal Development 
(NYCID) to provide tutoring and extracurricular activities of the our students. Additionally, NYCID is the organization 
that provides workshops to enhance the capabilities of our peer mediators. 

6) We also developed a relationship with United Activities Unlimited (UAU) and Summer Youth Employment Program 
(SYEP). There were several tiers of involvement: a) The academic/scholastic mentoring program; b) the summer job 
placement; c) training by a UAU facilitator on the school site that worked with student to be prepared for a 
career/internship/ apprenticeship program. 

7) We established Peer Group Connection (PGC) mentoring group and received training from that organization to 
insure that our teachers worked closely with a core group of seniors to push in to mentor at-risk freshman students 
through the physical education class. 

8) There are after school opportunities for students to be mentored in the career of Police Department and Fire 
Department through the Explorer's Programs. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Student Demographics: 

Our current student population is comprised of 6% Asian, 29% Black, 43% Hispanic, 20% White, 5% English Language 
Learners and 29% of Students With Special Needs. As 29% have I.E.P.'s with varying levels of support services. We 
offer SETSS, ICT, ASD, ACES, Self- contained classes and other personalized supports. As seen below, the SWD 
population achieves at a level of almost double the NYS cut point for this sub group. The instruction, in particular, our 
school-wide literacy/writing program, has supported the improved student outcomes for this population. 

Data Analysis: 

NYS data indicates for ELA, all groups made AYP.

1) The strength of the Humanities department relative to rigorous instruction is found in the teacher team work, 
videos and student learning outcomes and data. For Global History the passing rate for the administration of the 
regents in January and June 2018 (SY 17-18) was 54% which is up 17% from SY 2016-2017. For US History there is an 
70% pass rate that is up 1% from SY 2016-2017. 

2) The strength of the Math Department is in their intensive, paired team work for horizontal and vertical alignment 
in lesson planning. They used data-informed decision making to customize the initiative for the Department of 
Education and New York State so that it becomes leverage point to move student learning. For Geometry there is a 
49% passing rate that is up 3% from SY 2016-2017. For Algebra 2 there is a 73% passing rate that is up 31% from SY 
2016-2017.  

3) The strength of the Science Department is in adapting the literacy strategies that are turnkeyed by the Humanities 
Department. Through the teacher team work of data analysis and pattern analysis of the regents, the teachers 
continue to evolve in folding in the Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) methodologies to address 
student outcomes. For Earth Science there is a 55% passing rate that is up 12% from SY 2016-2017. For Chemistry, 
there is a 92% passing rate that is up 50% from SY 2016-2017. 

SPECIFIC NEEDS: 

1) 29% of our student population is comprised of students with IEPs. We serve students who have been classified as 
having emotional behavioral disabilities, learning disabilities, and intellectual delays. Students receive support based 
on their needs as stated in the IEPs, which may include counseling, reading, and speech services.

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Framework for Great Schools: 

In addressing the elements of the Framework for Great Schools, data from the Quality Review, NYC School Survey , 
and PPR visits, the strengths and accomplishments of the Ralph R. McKee Career and Technical Education High School 
community  

School Quality Snapshot - in 2016-2017 indicates that according to the Framework for Great Schools Elements McKee 
is rated "meeting" in the following areas: Effective School Leadership, Collaborative Teachers, Strong Family-
Community Ties, and Trust. The school is rated "approaching" in Rigorous Instruction, and Supportive Environment. 

  Rigorous Instruction: Despite significant strides in the quality of instruction as evidenced by 95% of the 

teachers being rated effective or higher in ADVANCE, performance data on six out of the nine Regents exams, 
increased number of students sitting for and completing the exam, improvement across all subject areas in 
multiple choice responses), Rigor, as mentioned in the Framework, continues to be a priority when 
formulating our plans for t2018-2019. One goal for this year is to demonstrate student proficiency in 
processing and communicating ideas effectively verbally and in writing. This will be addressed through the 
continued adoption and implementation of expository and argumentative writing, close reading and analysis , 
discussion protocols from AVID methodologies; and numeracy strategies from Algebra 4 All and ENGAGE NY.  
Supportive Environment and Trust: We, at McKee realize that without positive staff to student relationships 
with students, we would not be able to accomplish our goals. We are focusing on the elements of Supportive 
Environment and Trust. by looking at measures to improve Teacher to Student Relationships. We will increase 
the level of active participation from students through targeted advisory groups meeting with supervisors; 
and monthly meetings with the student government council. NYC School Survey results will increase positive 
student responses from 66 percent to 68 percent.  

 

  Collaborative Teachers: At R600, the professional learning and collaboration of teachers based upon building 
efficacy for teachers through building capacity for teacher leadership and adult learning. Teacher teams meet 
weekly with co-planning teams independently meeting during the week. All will work towards our 
instructional focus around student engagement. In our first year of implementing a teacher leadership model, 
an in-classroom teacher will lead peers in the 2018-2019 in Humanities and Science. The teacher leader will 
be provided with opportunities to strengthen and deepen the instructional direction of the school. 

 

  Effective School Leadership: Effective school leadership is essential in the successful development of an 
organization. All members of our school are welcomed, valued, and respected to enhance the sense of 
inclusiveness, provide social/emotional support, and create the sense of connection to the school. The 
Administration maintains an open-door policy with students, staff members, and families.  
Strong Family Community Ties: Our on-line grade book allows parents to follow their child’s progress on Pupil 
Path, both academically as well as their attendance. The use of School Messenger provides our parents with 
the most up-to-date information on what is happening on a daily basis. As we move into a school year with a 
focus on "Parent Engagement", we pledge to improve the level of communication and improve any areas of 
deficit, such as making the school web page more user friendly and a 24 hour return policy for all parents’ 
calls. Based upon analysis of the NYC School Survey, the school needs to strengthen family and community 
ties. Our goal in this element of the Framework is to increase parent participation in the educational and 
social/emotional aspects of each student’s high school career. The school seeks to increase this participation 
by 5% as compared to the previous school year. The meeting of this goal will be measured by attendance at 
Parent/Teacher conferences, parent participation at PTA meetings, parent participation in school wide events 
such as college/career planning meetings, and an increase in the response rate on the NYC School Survey.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

Student performance data on NYS examinations has not displayed the desired and corresponding results in three 
regents . The Regents pass rate includes 58% for Algebra I, 10% for Global History, 72% for ELA, 46% Living 
EnvironmentC. After a thorough examination of NYS exams together with NYC Baseline Performance Assessments, 
the data revealed that students are making gains in the multiple choice portion of tests; however, prior to 2016-17, 
over 40% of students were providing incomplete short responses and/or extended writing response sections. An area 
of growth for 2018-19 school year is to further develop students' ability to communicate their ideas effectively by 
improving their writing skills, deconstructing questions in Humanities and Science; and problem solving skills in Math 
and Science. 

For Global History and United States History instructors will use Passages, Core Collaborative formative assessment 
strategies and SRI Protocols. Through students seeing, recognizing, and analyzing good writing, they will be able to 
use the models as frames to generate strong products. 

Math will use an edited version of the ENGAGE NY curriculum for the Common Core Algebra Regents and Algebra 4 
All.  

English will use continue to refine application of the principles of Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization and 
Reading (WICOR). WICOR is reflective of AVID, which is an NYCDOE research based academic approach students to 
attain college and career readiness. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Goal 1 - By June 2019 school year, lesson plans, units of study and student projects will illustrate engaging, rigorous, and 
coherent curricula in all subjects, accessible for a variety of learners and aligned to Common Core Learning Standards 
and/or content standards, as measured by a 2% increase in student credit attainment.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Implementation of aligned CCLS within subject course 
curriculum/ curriculum map, which contains rich performance 
tasks that support Algebra 4 All, ENGAGE NY, Core Collaborative, 
Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) and College 
Board. This means that we want to focus on ways to empower 
assessment capable learners and collective teacher efficacy 

Using Data Assessment Tools (Oral review, Datacation, DDC from 
Skedula, ExamGen) to identify trends and make classroom-level 
decisions with regard to student performance.

We will focus on collective teacher efficacy. We have teachers 
discuss, implement, and share out strategies and check back in 
with each other to see what works in the classroom. In the grade 
level teams they worked on specific units in Collections. The 
teachers shared best practices and develop common 
assessments. This helped with the integrated ENL so that the 
teachers could focus on particular content and units. 

 

The strategies that will continue to use were exemplars in 
writing. Tried to build assessment capable students. The 
feedback should come from the teacher in terms of actionable 
next steps. This is a practice that we want to spread to all of the 
academic disciplines. 

 

The goal is to have 50% of the students to give effective 
feedback. 

 

Will continue to turn our attention to the speaking and listening 
standards of the Common Core, and the accountable talk for the 
protocols. We are aiming for 50% of the entire school to use the 
McKee paired discussion protocol and the group discussion 
protocol designed by 17 teachers who participated in the Core 
Collaborative. The teachers all reflect every discipline at McKee 

Providing structured Professional Development/Collaborations 
(PD) in which teachers help teachers in using protocols from the 
National School Reform Faculty Site to analyze lessons, and 
student work. Based on areas of focus highlighted from Job 
Embedded Support for ADVANCE Implementation (JESA) visits, 
the teacher teams will focus on the Danielson Framework of 
Teaching, engaging teachers in an ongoing inter-visitation 
program with their colleagues, developing exemplary teacher 
practices aligned to Danielson Components 1a, 1e, 3b, 3c, and 
3d.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
As indicated in the school’s Mission and Vision statements, McKee is committed to providing a safe and productive 
environment which will allow students to succeed. The school provides a number of social/emotional supports such 
as peer mediation/conflict resolution, Peer Group Connection, access to counseling, additional programming options, 
and an open-door policy to all supervisors' offices. These supports enable the school to: -decrease the number of 
reportable incidents as the school year progresses -maintain the significant majority of On-Line Occurrence Reporting 
System (OORS) and reduce the number of suspensions. 

Our present attendance is 87%, we are focusing on chronically absent students by having monthly attendance 
meetings. The Community Associate teams with the Attendance teacher to conduct home visits after outreach by 
Blackboard Connect, teacher phone calls, emails and texts have not yielded a sufficient response.  

Based on the OORS report Incident Location Summary there were a total of 405 incidences for 2017-2018. The 
majority of the incidences were Level 3 at 143, with a majority of the locations for the occurrences in the classroom 
and hallway. Second was Level 1 at 135, with a majority of the locations of the occurrences in the classroom and 
hallway. Third was Level 2 at 61, with a majority of the locations of the occurrences at the Entrance/Exit. Fourth was 
Level 4 at 56, with a majority of the locations of the occurrences in the classroom and cafeteria. Fifth was Level 5 at 
10, with a majority of the locations of the occurrences in the classroom and close proximity to the school. 

Based on the analysis of the OORs reports, through the teacher team meetings focusing on employing methods of 
student engagement in the classroom, we hope to reduce the number level 3 occurrences by 2%. 

Although a system of supports is in place, 65 percent of student respondents rated McKee as a supportive 
environment compared to a 72% percent city-wide average, according to the 2016-17 NYC School Survey. Based upon 
data obtained from both NYC and in-house surveys, it is evident that the school needs to improve its efforts to 
consistently improve student voice and student-led change to improve outcomes for all students. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

Goal 2 - By June 2019, through guidance counselors working collaboratively with the community based organizations, 
(NYCID), related service providers, the community associate, and the attendance teacher outreach efforts, we will 
create a welcoming environment for families as evidenced by events which will translate into a 1% increase in overall 
student attendance.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on an analysis of 2018-2019 Master Program, 85% of the teachers are scheduled with common teacher 
planning time on a departmental level either period 1 or period 9. Participation in the School Time Lab meetings 
during SY 2017-2018 made us aware of the need to have subject area common planning time.. The limitations of 
programming made it a challenge to schedule departmental Professional Development and Planning Time during and 
after the school day, decreasing the likeliness of the opportunities to promote teacher-to-teacher collaboration within 
and outside of their subject-area departments. 

Following the principles of the Core Collaborative and National School Reform, McKee will use published protocols,. 
We will introduce trained peer facilitators or point people to guide their colleagues. The peer facilitators will coach 
the group and encourage the group to persevere until the issue is resolved. Looking at effective feedback and student 
work, will be a focus that will direct teachers to generate, implement and assess the strategies they devise in the 
teachers. 

 Informed by the Capacity Framework Element – Collaborative Teachers, our most recent QR and an analysis of the 
2017-2018 Master Program, the data supports that a greater percentage of teachers within a departmental subject-
level need to be scheduled with Teacher Common Planning Time with their fellow subject-level teachers, as well as 
their supervisor. The needs assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
Goal 3 - By June 2019, school leadership will implement a professional development plan that builds teachers’ capacity 
to use differentiated questioning and discussion techniques for students in all classes, resulting in a 5% increase in 
teachers improving one performance level reflected in component 3b Questioning and Discussion Techniques in the 
Advance system.

Uniform unit exams within subject areas and grade levels will be administered and the data will be loaded into the IO 
Assessment portal, or Exam Gen so that teachers can examine the item analysis of each question and adjust 
curriculum development scheduling and supports from the information gathered. Final exams from the Fall 2018 
semester will display at least the 2018 passing rate, as those assessments will parallel the Common Core Regents

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to data from the School Information Sheet, 26 percent of teachers are currently working out of certification 
area due to a change in demographics of students. The school is increasingly enrolling more standardized assessment 
students who are working towards a Regents diploma and CTE certification. With this shift in student population, 
teacher certification as related to teaching assignments is affected.  

The results of the 2018 NYC School Survey indicate that the principal understands how children learn (94 percent). 
The principal makes clear to the staff his or her expectations for meeting instructional goals. (92 percent). he principal 
sets high standards for student learning. (91 percent). The principal sets clear expectations for teachers about 
implementing what they have learned in professional development (91 percent). The principal sets high standards for 
student learning (91 percent). the principal sets clear expectations for teachers about implementing what they have 
learned in professional development (91 percent). the principal carefully tracks student academic progress (91 
percent). The principal participates in instructional planning with teams of teacher (91 percent). The principal 
communicates a clear vision for this school (90%). The parents feel that the principal works to create a sense of 
community in the school (95%). While these results are positive and an improvement from previous years, the data 
also reveals that growth is still needed. Survey respondents indicated that 77 percent felt that the teachers have 
influence over the selection of instructional materials used in classrooms and only 77 percent feel that teachers have 
influence over standards for student behavior. Currently, the principal prioritizes classroom visits and instructional 
support to new teachers, probationary teachers up for tenure, and teachers rated Developing. As we build on our 
strengths and recognize our areas of growth in leadership as it pertains to all teachers and specifically those working 
out out certification area, transparency, reflective feedback, and high visibility in instructional supervision will be a top 
priority. 

Informed by the Capacity Framework Element – Effective School Leadership, current data and teacher observation 
feedback reflects a need to deepen and enhance practices and strategies that address Danielson Competencies 1a – 
Demonstrating knowledge of content and pedagogy; 1e – Designing coherent instruction; 3b – Using Questioning and 
Discussion Techniques, 3c – Engaging students in learning; and 3d – Using assessment in instruction. The needs 
assessment informed the development of the annual goal listed below. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

Goal 4 - By June 2019, school leadership will nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff such that students 
will produce meaningful work products aligned to engaging curricula based on a coherent set of beliefs about how 
student learn as expressed horizontally and vertically across the school setting, as measured by work product rubrics 
designed to assess the alignment and rigor of the work as it relates to the content areas.

The strength of McKee in sharing information to the McKee Community is through the use of technology: Outlook 
email and weekly E-Newsletters. The School Leadership Team receives monthly reports from department supervisors 
and lead teachers as to the educational initiatives in the school. News regarding college and career readiness 
information to events from the PTA are included in the E-Newsletters. Information about after school and Saturday 
School programs are relayed through Blackboard Connect. 

The school's priority need will be to have the services of a Community Associate to help translate the information to 
the ENL population which comprises 41% of the school, so that the reticence of the parents due to fear, or lack of 
comprehension regarding the need to partner with the school, will be overcome. 

Based upon a three-year analysis of the class of 2013, 2014, and 2015’s Graduation Survey and Earned College Credit 
data, it was determined that while there was a decline in the percentage of students declaring an “undeclared major” 
upon entering college from 17% to 12%, there was a 25% increase in the number of students graduating with 16-60 
earned college credits upon high school graduation. While both of these statistics reflect upward trajectories in 
meeting College and Career Readiness objectives, a correlation has been made that suggests that a significant number 
of the 12% that are “declaring undecided” are on the upper side of the 16-60 college credits earned, thus placing 
them in a position upon entering college where there is an urgent expectation to declare a major that they haven’t 
spent sufficient time exploring. Our school, in response, has spent the past three years in developing a Career 
Exploration Curriculum to address this issue. 

Informed by the Capacity Framework Element – Community Ties, our most recent QR and an analysis of the 2015 and 
2016 Graduation Rates for Regents with Advanced Designation and CTE Endorsement data, the feedback supports 
that a College Exploration using AVID methodologies infused via our school’s CTE – Work Based Learning Program, to 
better inform students as to Career Pathways as they prepare for college, career or life. The needs assessment 
informed the development of the annual goal listed below.

Starting in the 9th grade, students are provided access to the 
nationally acclaimed college admissions and career 
exploration database, Naviance Succeed. As part of the 4-year 
process, students are expected to complete a series of 
interest, personality and career interest surveys, with their 
parent/guardian. The purpose of the Career Interest Profiler,

numerous opportunities each week, offering students the 
opportunity to explore various career pathways, via a 
“Backpack to Briefcases” series, as well as Job Shadowing and 
potential internship and other Work Based Learning 
opportunities. Students, parents, and guardians will check 
with the CTE teacher who is then vetted by Mr. Dave Sarno 
(Work Based Learning Coordinator)).  

Parents and guardians interested in presenting or 
recommending a presenter for our Backpack to Briefcases 
series are encouraged to contact the administration. 

Based upon the Naviance career survey results, suggested 
college matches aligned with student career interests are 
provided. This information is accessible to the student, parent 
and school counselor, as well as, the college and career 
advisor. Using the web-based Naviance tool, students are able 
to focus their college inquiry by analyzing and comparing data 
provided from prior Tech graduates including GPA and 
SAT/ACT scores achieved for admission.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Ralph R. McKee CTE High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

Ralph R. McKee CTE High School’s (McKee) Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment 
of the needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with 
disabilities. The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent 
involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation 
through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of 
parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

 

Ralph R. McKee CTE High School will support parents and families of Title I students by:

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of 
McKee’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

-parents have access to the hard copy and free version of indicating their opinion about the topics for future 
workshops and effectiveness of the workshops they attend: surveymonkey.com 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills;

# and types of certified teachers

Begin description here:            
The rationale for the Title iii plan has two major components.  Over 50% of the ENL population 
are 9th and 10th graders.  Data analysis, through examination of the in house data analysis with 
data lead  and ENL teachers  conveys  that most of the 9th and 10th grade students need 
additional  support in the writing modality.  Last year's NYSESLAT Data indicated that students 
needed additional support in  listening speaking for the 2017-2018 school year. Now writing is 
the identified area of support for  the 2018-2019 school year   This year writing will be the focus. 
Historical data indicates that 10th grade ENL students have a low passing rate on the Global 
History  Exam. For the 2017-2018 school year, the data shows that 9 ENL students sat for the 
Global History Exam and only 1 passed. Therefore, the Title III program will  target 9th and 10th 
grade ENL students and provide the curricula and instructional  supports listed below. All 
subgroups New Comer, Developing and Long Term ENL Students  will be a part of the Title III 
program. Title III will be used as supplemental funding for Achieve 3000, (unless another 
resource, THINK Cerca, can be negotiated at a less cost) and teacher per session. At this time 
20% of the funding will be allocated for Achieve 3000 and teacher per session and PD 
supplemented by Visions funding. 
 
1. Achieve 3000 Reading Program: 
 The Five Step Literacy Process will build the capacity of students to read closely and revisit 
text, with native language support ,  to answer multiple choice questions with greater accuracy. 
The resources available in the program will also help support students in building background 
knowledge of Global History with differentiated reading selections that make apt and 
relevant connections to the real world. The program also includes the Boost Access 
in Spanish for students. 
 
Additionally, through the formative assessment process embedded in the Achieve Program, 
teachers will help students build their capacity to  be assessment capable learners, set goals and 
monitor their own progress. 
The Achieve 3000 educational program is not used during the daily mandated instruction. 
 
The possible alternative THINK CERCA, helps students to develop writing skills in the content 
are through the development of claim and evidence writing ( expository) and argument writing. 
 
2. AVID Elective Class WICOR Based Strategies  
The AVID  college and career readiness elective focuses on Equal Access for All Students by 
building  Communication, Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration Organization and Reading skills 
through the use of a standards based curriculum, delivered by a trained teacher. Students targeted 
for AVID are those with level 2 literacy levels. * years of data shows that 100% of students in 
the AVID program graduate in 4 years with a regents or advanced regents diploma.  McKee's 
Title iii program would pair a trained AVID elective teacher, with a licensed ENL teacher. In 
both English and Spanish language instruction ,the collaborative teacher team will develop the 
capacity of  ENL students to read and navigate a variety of primary and secondary sources 
incorporating strategies to improve ENL students learning outcomes in reading, answering

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
multiple choice questions and writing, all skills required on the Global History Exam and the 
NYSESLAT. Additionally, students will learn organizational skills and collaborative study 
methods offered only in the AVID Elective classes. 
 
While AVID is offered during the school day, the more comprehensive aspects of the  AVID 
elective curriculum is offered only to  approximately 10% of the school's population. The 
strategies used in AVID builds students' capacity to persevere when navigating challenging 
academic content through the development of meta -cognitive strategies around critical 
reading,engaging with text, collaboration and organization. The AVID  curriculum and strategies 
will be used in the Title iii program, and delivered by an AVID trained teacher as part of the after 
school program. The targeted Title iii students will receive instruction in AVID strategies as part 
of the Title iii program, as supplemental instruction after school. Specifically, students will 
engage in the Collaborative Study Group Protocol. This is only offered to 10% of the school 
population during the school day. Therefore, the infusion of AVID Elective Strategies will be 
supplemental. 
 
 An important component of the program is to support our long term ENL students who are 
taking the Global History Exam. Students  will read about history for pleasure as well as for 
academic pursuits, also using the Achieve 3000 Reading program, focusing on informational and 
Global History texts and then engaging in AVID Collaborative Study Groups, Socratic Seminars 
and Philosophical chairs. 
 
Home language support will provided through  access to reading material on Achieve 3000 in the 
home language of Spanish. Home language support will also be provided by the ENL teacher in 
Spanish when incorporating the AVID WICOR strategies. Materials from the AVID curriculum 
such as Costa's  Level of Questions in Spanish are provided to students. Instruction will be 
delivered in both Spanish and English. 
 
The Title III ENL collaborative team will also focus on Oral language  to increase the frequency, 
complexity and accuracy of students' spoken exchanges regarding Global History and references 
to to other content areas, implementing pair and group discussion protocols, listening 
to/delivering speeches, philosophical chairs and Socratic seminars. As capacity is built students 
will create videos of these collaborative activities for in school publication. 
 
The  Title III ENL collaborative Team will also focus on writing to increase fluency and 
accuracy when writing about history, using diagnostic assessment of writing samples and  the 
formative assessment strategies of the Core Collaborative Impact Team work. Teachers will 
focus on style and  focus  lessons to help students elaborate on their ideas and and use more 
academic vocabulary and sophisticated syntax as they write. 
 
4. While exploring Global History content and references to other content areas,  students will 
learn to take control of their education by developing and using skills that allow them to better 
navigate academic content and become more self regulatory. They will learn strategies for 
organizing planning , setting goals, taking notes and analyzing teacher expectations ( with a 
focus in the Global History class). Students will learn and engage in the AVID Elective Student 
led Collaborative Study Group  protocol. As students build capacity, they will set goals and 
create videos of their student led study groups  for in school publication  
 
The Title III program will serve 9th and 10th grade ENL students inclusive of Newcomer, 
Developing and Long Term students. The Title III program will run  Tuesdays and Thursday for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Formative Assessments used to guide instructional planning for our ENL students are the Beginning of Year Assessment from 
the NYCDOE  and or the grade level assessments which are regents based prompts. Teachers also use the AVID Interactive 
Notebook  for day to day formative assessments as well as archived English regents exams and regents based writing prompts. 
To assess the  literacy level of ENL students, teachers and school leaders also reference the RLAT, the 8th grade literacy scores 
as well as  the EDAT Tool, when available. Examination of the EDAT Reports for the 2017-2018 school year indicated that  9th 
and 10th grade ENL  students performed well in speaking and writing and received lower scores in the modalities of reading 
and listening. On the 9th and 10th grade level, 22 of 40 students score high in the writing modality. 33 of 44 students scored 
high in the speaking modality. These findings indicate that ENL students had a stronger performance applying skills that are 
the focus of instruction in the ELA integrated setting classrooms ( speaking and writing) Accordingly, the data conveys that 
more targeted instruction in listening, ( without marking a text or taking notes) and then answering multiple choice 
questions, needs to be provided for our students during the 2017-2018 school year . To support this instructional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

adjustment,  the following resources were used: NYSESLAT Test Materials for Teachers and students,Achieve 3000 ( for 25 ENL 
students ) . ENL teachers will work with their co teachers to identify readings and MC questions from Achieve 3000  and the 
regents archive that  are thematically related to the ELA and Social Studies  Units of Study. 
Not having access to the EDAT data as of October 2018, the ENL Study Group comprised of three ENL teachers and the 
Assistant Principal examined the data from the RLAT  and determined the following: Average scores overall for all modalities 
for all students was 57.27. The average scores for listening, speaking and reading were closely grouped 
Listening: 16.46       Writing 6.79 
Reading: 16.75 
Speaking: 17.27 
The  RLAT data shows that writing is the area to be targeted for growth. The school also looks forward to reviewing the  the 
EDAT data to dive deeper into each particular student's information. 
 
ENL students require multiple opportunities or "swipes" at summative writing assessments such as the central idea, argument, 
thematic/enduring idea, CRQ and  NYSESLAT Writing prompts. Instructional planning includes implementing  the  research 
based formative assessment strategies from the Core Collaborative and the full expanse of the writing process. In order to 
prepare students to write, teachers in the integrated ENL setting plan and draw from SIOP ( Language Objectives) AVID and 
Core Collaborative methods( upcoming infusion of Hochman)  in order to develop  the meta cognitive strategies and language 
skills  for students to cite evidence, interact with multiple texts,  and draw from multiple texts to respond to a writing prompt 
evidencing command of content, skill and language. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Structures in place to guide instructional planning for ENLs include, regular  team meeting with the AP, ENL teachers and 
content  teacher(s) ro review the  EDAT data when available as well as teacher team meetings. The NYSESLAT results for 
example are distributed to the ENL teachers at the beginning of the year and again with the EDAT, if available and or the 
school generated data.   The examination of these assessments also serve to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the 
students.  Following these study groups, Professional Development opportunities are identified to help support the next 
steps.  To further aid the dissemination process, the ENL teachers turnkey the information gathered at Professional 
Development opportunities to address the findings. For example information gathered from the SIOP PD was presented to the 
English and Social Studies Department and Science for the 2017-2018 school year. For the 2018-2019 school year, the focus for 
reading is the use of AVID Close reading strategies to help ENL students access complex text, Core Collaborative Formative 
Assessment strategies and analysis of data to form a plan. 
 
 
In the interim the Humanities Inquiry Team examined the RLAT data in an  ENL Study group comprised of an AP, ENL and  1 
content teacher. In collaboration with content teachers, ENL teachers will identify scaffolds, strategies and formative 
assessment practices to support ENL instructional growth based on looking at ENL student work and identifying actionable 
feedback and supports needed.  
During LASW cycles, questions from the School Reform Initiative will be asked to develop an understanding of student 
misconceptions. Examples of specific questions are asked by the facilitator are 
Atlas Protocol: 
1. What do you see? 
2. From the student's perspective, what is the student working on? 
3. What are the implications of this work for teaching and assessment? 
Equity Protocol: ( looking at teacher work) 
1. What do you see that would be engaging to many different students? 
2. What do you see that would meet more than one learning modality? 
3. What do you see that would support/hinder ENL students? 
4. What do you see that would be considered bias in the language used in the assessment/assignment? 
 
An additional method for LASW that will be utilized in the teacher teams is the Evidence, Analysis, Action protocol from the 
Core Collaborative. Evidence from argument writing will be analyzed for our ENL students by sorting the excel file, examining

 partment and Science for the 2017-2018 school year. 
For the 2018-2019 school year, the school is focusing on the area of writing for the ENL students. McKee is arranging to send 
and ENL and content area teacher to the Hochman PD in order to target student writing on the NYSESLAT and Global History 
Regents. 
The AP and the ENL study group  work together to analyze the results of ENL students and Regents examinations.  As of 
October 2017, we have been working with Regents data and looking at how to interpret the results to inform our teaching 
practice.  Our findings support our consistent use of  instructional interventions and strategies as evidenced by the number of 
students exiting the ENL program via the English Regents Examination.  With regards to the ENL population, the trend is that 
they are more successful in ELA and there is an improvement US History.  This further supports the benefits that the 
instructional strategies ( AVID, Formative Assessment SIOP, Core Collaborative Formative Assessments) and interventions are 
having on this population. In addition, we have examined the attendance rate for the ENL population and overall, the majority 
of ENL students have documented excellent attendance as compared to the population as a whole.  For example 92% of the 
ENL students have at least 90% attendance rate  year to date. For the 2018-2019 school year the ENL attendance rate remains 
significantly higher than the rest of the school at 92% again. 
This demonstrates that students are engaged in their learning and taking ownership of their learning.  As teachers work to 
make learning more meaningful, ENL student work is analyzed alongside their peers work to inform instructional gaps that are 
present. The curriculum is adjusted to reflect areas that need to be revisited and address any misconceptions that may be 
present.  This approach is proving to be successful because the ENL students data overall is improving as per the following data 
sources 
 
At this time no NYSITELL data is available.  However if this data were present, we would examine the data in the ENL study 
group, identify students for tutoring and examine the strengths and weaknesses that the students presented as a result of this 
assessment. 
 
After accessing the RLAT and REgents  scores, the ENL teachers and AP use the scores to determine what classes and 
assessments are still needed.  Student programs are adjusted to reflect recommendations and needs.  In order to effectively 
address student needs, we are programming students in accordance to their test performance in the previous year, within the 
confines of CR Part 154.2. Therefore, we are using the data to not only drive instruction but to also program effectively and in 
accordance with CR Part 154.2. For example, two ENL teachers are co teaching in the Global, Math and Science classrooms for 
the 2018-2019 school year. 
 
 
Curriculum will be adjusted to address learning gaps by identifying specific resources and strategies in collaboration with 
school leadership and the ENL study group.  Individual ENL student work will be examined once a month in English and Social 
Studies beginning in November 2018. Student work and revisions will be documented and kept to evaluate future progress.( in 
progress)  Pedagogical approaches resources , scaffolds and strategies will be indicated based on the ATLAS and or 
EAA protocols. Teachers will inter visit using the Peer Collaborative Teacher model.  For the 2018-2019, based on the 
examination of data for ENL as a group, the following approaches and strategies will be used, formative Assessment strategies 
from the Core Collaborative, AVID reading and writing strategies,  Language objectives aligned with the Common Core learning 
target, and Hochman method to hone writing skills, especially in Global History. ( Hochman is pending) 
 
 
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

Baseline  assessments are the NYCDOE BOY Assessment, RLAT/NYSESLAT . Benchmark assessments  also include regents based 
prompts for the English and Global regents. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 Teachers use looking at student work protocols, identifying next steps ( interventions).  Check in dates (calendar dates for 
looking at student work and evaluations) are embedded into the teacher teams in English and will be implemented into the 
Global History  in 2017-2018. Interventions will draw from the  ENL Professional Development SIOP/ AVID methodologies, 
Speaking and Listening  strategies developed in March 2017 during the Core Collaborative Evidence Walk and Professional 
Development Interventions can include small group and one to one interventions, as well as the formative assessment 
strategies gathered from the Core Collaborative. Structures to support this work are weekly teacher team meetings and daily 
common planning sessions for ENL and content area teachers working in the integrated setting. Assessment findings for ENL 
students are disseminated through a presentation to the SLT and ongoing presentations to content area departments. 
Building on the summative data from 2018, for the 2018-2019 school year, teachers will continue to leverage the formative 
assessment process and the use of actionable feedback and learning progressions to build the capacity of ENL students to act 
on feedback from the teacher and peer and self assess. Teachers are also unpacking the CCLS in order to improve teacher 
clarity and focus learning on standards  aligned learning objectives and language objectives (i.e, how will students use 
language to access and work towards mastery of the learning target.) 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
   Using the NYSESLAT ( RLAT) EDAT Data as well classroom assessments, supports and interventions for ENL students, ENL 
teachers will  begin to create an intervention plan for each  ENL student for the 2018-2019 school year. The intervention plan 
will be guided by continued cycles of Looking at Student work after interventions have been implemented. For the 2018 2019 
school year, selected ENL students will have a portfolio tracking progress in ELA and Social Studies which includes the 
strategies and interventions implemented. Teachers in the integrated setting will also utilize learning progressions( levels on 
state rubrics), actionable feedback and  student goal setting. 
 
ENL students who need extra support in specified content areas are identified for Title III and Tutoring in  content areas.  At 
risk ENL students are also targeted to attend Title III and NYCID tutoring program to further support their academic growth. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
 ENL study group  and AP examine the NYSESLAT results at the beginning of the year and the report card and regents data in 
February .  TheseENL study group   At this time no NYSITELL data is available.  However if this data were present, we would 
examine the data in the ENL study group, identify students for tutoring and examine the strengths and weaknesses that the 
students presented as a result of this assessment.   
 
Teachers will continue to use Looking at student work protocols and continue to identify next steps ( interventions).  Check in 
dates (calendar dates for looking at student work and evaluations) are embedded into the teacher teams in English and will be 
implemented into the Social Studies teams 2018-2019.  Curricula will be adjusted to address learning gaps using the targeted 
strategies drawn from the  ENL Professional Development SIOP/ AVID methodologies, Speaking and Listening  strategies 
developed in March 2017 during the Core Collaborative Evidence Walk and Professional Development. Structures to support 
this work are weekly teacher team meetings and daily common planning sessions for ENL and content area teachers working 
in the integrated setting. 
 
RLAT language proficiency levels, REDS Item analysis, the EDAT tool and Regents exams are used to inform ENL instructional 
planning and intervention.  Students are also programmed using these results to provide academic support.  One example 
would be double  English classes for those students who are preparing to take the Regents exam.  ENL students who need 
extra support in specified content areas are also identified for Title III and 1.5  Living Environment.  At risk ENL students are 
also targeted to attend Title III and NYCID tutoring program to further support their academic growth. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

 

 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Structures in place to disseminate findings are the weekly teacher team meetings, School Leadership Team meetings, PTA 
Meetings and PD Committee Meetings.

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 1.( Freestanding ENL) 
 
  ENL students are placed in Gen Ed, ICT or self contained classes with mixed proficiency levels.  As of the 2017- 2018 
school year,  McKee High School will follow CR Part 154 and program students based on each student’s proficiency 
level to provide the mandated number of minutes in both the ENL Stand alone and ENL/ELA Integrated settings. In the 
integrated courses, the ENL teacher and the content area teacher will co teach and work together collaboratively to 
implement high quality “scaffolded” and differentiated instruction for all students, especially ENL students. Structures 
to support this work are weekly teacher team meetings,  daily common planning sessions and professional 
development. Strategies and methods include SIOP resoruces for Language Objectives that are aligned with the CCLS, 
AVID close reading and engagement strategies and Core Collaborative Formative Assessment Strategies based on 
Learning Target ( unpacked CCLS and success criteria) 
 
In the stand alone class students will work with the ENL teacher to explicitly develop literacy skills in English so that 
students can  succeed in Core Content Courses, As per CR Part 154, a student’s proficiency level will dictate the 
number of minutes . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

At this time, McKee CTE High School does not offer a bilingual program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

At this time, McKee CTE High School does not offer a dual language program. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            McKee High School ensures that ENL students receive the mandated number of instructional minutes by having the 
programmer, Assistant Principal and the ENL coordinator collaborate to ensure that all ENL students are appropriately placed 
in a stand-alone and/ or an  integrated course. McKee has a stand-alone ENL program, therefore as per CR Part 154.2, the ENL 
instructional minutes are delivered as follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

•     Entering (9-12) receive 540 minutes per week of both ENL and integrated ENL/ELA/ or content area 
•     Emerging ( 9-12) receive 360 minutes per week for both ENL and integrated ENL/ELA/ or content area 
•     Transitioning and Expanding (9-12) receive 180 minutes per week of both ENL and integrated ENL/or content area. 
•     Commanding (9-12) Receive 90 minutes per week of integrated ENL/Content Area.   
 
In order to provide explicit minutes of ENL instruction, as of the 2017- 2018 school year,  McKee High School will follow CR Part 
154 and program students based on each student’s proficiency level to provide the mandated number of minutes in Global 
history,  ENL Stand alone and ENL/ELA Integrated settings. In the integrated courses, the ENL teacher and the content area 
teacher will co teach and work together collaboratively to implement high quality “scaffolded” and differentiated instruction 
to engage all students in learning which also include the  ENL students. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
ENL Integrated   
McKee ENL students will be placed in general education, ICT or self-contained content area courses inclusive of English, Math, 
Science, and Social Studies. All courses are delivered in English; however, scaffolds and differentiation strategies are part of 
daily instruction to ensure that all students are engaged in learning the content. All curriculum and instruction is common core 
aligned.  McKee teachers will use AVID methodologies reflective of WICOR, Writing, Inquiry, Collaboration, Organization and 
Reading and SIOP strategies. Attention to WICOR strategies will provide opportunities for students to read, listen, speak and 
write. Teachers will  devise language objectives aligned to content,use visual aids, graphic organizers and audio support as well 
as focusing on academic and content area vocabulary. Additionally, ENL integrated teachers and content teachers will 
differentiate instruction for ENL student using whole class, small group and one to one approaches. 
  
McKee implements AVID, SIOP and Core Collaborative methodologies in all classes. Teachers focus on inquiry based student 
centered instruction with multiple opportunities for students to grapple with content via the speaking/listening and reading 
and writing standards.  Teachers will use collaborative student to student discussions,  specifically designed to promote 
language proficiency, sentence frames, and AVID process and timed writing strategies. Teachers will also look at student work 
using the Inquiry Process, identify student needs and then indicate strategies and interventions for all students, especially ENL 
students.   
 
ENL Stand Alone instruction will focus on developing English Language Skills so that students can succeed in core content 
areas. The Stand Alone ENL teacher will use instructional methods  from ASCD, Moving From Spoken to Written Language with 
ENL ( Ivannia Soto), Core Collaborative Impact Team work, Monthly ENL check ins in the content area, AVID text interaction 
strategies. 
 
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   McKee ENL students will be appropriately evaluated in their home language throughout the year in the following ways: 
1. If Spanish is identified as the home language, incoming students will be provided with the NYSITELL examination. 
2.  ENL students will take practice New York State Regents Examinations ( other than English), in their home language or with 
side by side translations based on student choice.  This will provide a benchmark data and determine if reading  the exam in 
the home language will support student outcomes.  
  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE: Will provide small group instruction and activities in both English and the home language to the extent possible. A 
bilingual peer will be identified. Through the use of HMH Collections text, ENL and content area teachers can 
provide  differentiated readings for students. Each Collections unit has a close reader with less complex text and additional 
scaffolding. Teachers will use AVID and SIOP strategies employing all the modalities as well as content glossaries in the home 
language. Alternate texts in the home language will be provided  to the extent possible. Student work will be examined in the 
teacher team meetings following establish protocols. Appropriate strategies and interventions will be identified. Content area 
and academic vocabulary instruction will be planned and implemented.  The Impact Team Model and SRI Protocol will be 
utilized and student work will be examined with strategies and interventions identified and progress monitored in the various 
teacher teams. 
 
NEWCOMER: McKee will provide small group instruction and identify a bilingual peer, if available, and provide a glossary in the 
home language for the content area and differentiated texts and materials. Teachers will implement AVID Strategies. Using the 
Impact Team model,  ENL teachers will provide internal PD for  content area teams in implementing  ENL strategies from AVID, 
Collections, Core Collaborative and SIOP.  Student work will be examined in the teacher teams. Needs, strategies and 
interventions will be identified and student progress monitored by the teacher team. 
 
DEVELOPING: McKee will provide differentiated activities using AVID, SIOP strategies, and Karen Hess' Rigor Matrix as well as 
Costa's level of Questions,   graphic organizers, visuals, and plan instruction that provides multiple opportunities for students 
to grapple with content in all four modalities. Student work will be examined in the teacher teams. Needs, strategies and 
interventions will be identified. Student progress will be monitored. 
 
LONG TERM: 
 The percentage of LTE students has decreased from 61% in the 2013-2014 school year,  54% in the 2014-2015 school 
year.  Presently, the percentage of LTE is 50%. The Assistant Principal  and ENL teachers will, together with Guidance 
staff,  work as a team to implement a plan to address the lack of progress or "flat profile" of our long term ENL students in 
terms of new language acquisition. 
 
In October,  using an Inquiry protocol, the team will look closely at the NYSESLAT data for all LTE students as well as examine 
the past achievement of the LTE students. This examination will be thorough and include analysis of the language, experiential 
background, individual learning style, family education history, and external or environmental factors. Under the guidance of 
the AP, content teachers and  ENL teachers will analyze curriculum maps for strategies that can be implemented to  strengthen 
engagement and opportunities for success for ENL students.   Lessons will be  revised to address the identified needs of our 
LTE students for literacy acquisition and development. 
 
FORMER ENL: McKee will provide Former ENL students with ongoing support in the form of AVID and SIOP  strategies and 
Write Path Methodologies as well as continued focus on academic and content area vocabulary. Student work will be 
examined in the teacher teams to increase collective teacher efficacy and therefore ensure greater student success.  In order 
to meet student needs, strategies and interventions will be identified and student progress monitored.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 The instructional strategies and grade level material  that teachers of ENL- SWDs use to provide access to academic content 
and accelerate English Language Development are: 
- AVID strategies  such as Cornell Notes, Marking the text, text dependent questions  WICOR activities, ( Writing, Inquiry, 
Collaboration, Organization and Reading) 
- AVID Write Path Methodologies supporting writing to learn and process writing. 
-Collections close reading and differentiated   strategies for ENL and SWD students ( citywide curriculum selection) 
-Differentiated strategies learned by ENL teachers at Staten Island Borough Support Center Series Differentiating Instruction 
for ENL students 
- SIOP Strategies

advanced planning and implementation for planned interventions based on Looking  and student work and on going student 
work portfolio in English and Social Studies.Academic and content area vocabulary and regular examination of student 
work  will happen  in all teacher teams. The examination will lead to identified needs, strategies and interventions that will be 
couched in the strategies from AVID, CAL and Collections resources and strategies and formative Assessment strategies from 
the Core Collaborative. Another aspect of the planned strategy will be to increase outreach to the homes of chronically absent 
LTE students in collaboration with Pierre Ovalles, Community Associate. Additionally, the ELA department will continue 
the  implementation of  the use of the Collections Literature Circles that offer an array multi cultural texts.   
 
Based on the success of the AVID Program  which offers an common core aligned student centered curriculum

development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At McKee the Mr. Ovalles will work closely with the AP of Humanities and Guidance as well as the counselors and the 
attendance teacher  and ENL to reach out to the parents of ENL students. The ENL teacher will contact the parent/guardians of 
ENL students via the phone to schedule annual individual meetings, in addtion to the regularly scheduled parent meetings and 
teacher conferences and parent information night). The ENL teacher will arrange for an in person interpreter or a phone 
conference  as needed. The ENL teacher will keep a portfolio of student work and be able to examine the student's AVID 
binder to determine the student's language development progress, assessment results, needs and interventions. The ENL 
teacher will share this data with the parent/guardian and how the ENL program at McKee will help to support and enrich the 
child's  language acquisition. The ENL teacher will also ask at least two content area teachers ( especially in an area of growth 
and struggle)to be a part of the meeting with the parent. Additionally, the ENL teacher will work with the AVID team to include

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Sharon Alicia Henry, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The protocols used to assess language preferences of the parent/guardian community for both written and oral 
communication are described as follows: 
 
Review the RADL available on the intranet and ATS. 
Review the HLIS for entering students. 
Look specifically at the RAPL , RECF RCON to identify the specific needs for oral and written communication. 
ATS reports are reviewed regularly throughout the year to ensure the written and oral needs assessment is 
updated and accurate. The reports are reviewed by both the LAC and the Pupil Accounting Secretary. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
