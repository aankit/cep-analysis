Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

TALES’ Mission : The mission of The Active Learning Elementary School (TALES), a PK-3 school, is to foster academic 
excellence in a safe and caring learning environment, through a partnership of family, staff, and community. TALES 
strives to meet children's academic, physical, and social needs with the belief that educating the whole child allows 
for learning at optimal levels. With our rigorous academic curriculum, emphasis on social development, and a focus 
on health and nutrition, students will receive the foundation necessary to excel academically as well as to lead 
healthy, productive lives.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
We are committed to actualizing our mission and devote considerable resources to make our mission a reality. We 
recognize that our families and our community are essential in actualizing our mission and invite their participation 
in all aspects of their child's educational journey. We believe that this is part of the reason why we average 97% 
student attendance for the year and continue to have a long waitlist of families interested in sending their children 
to TALES. 

We have numerous partnerships and collaborations that help make TALES a special place. These include but are not 
limited to: 

Fan4Kids 

Studio in a School 

  NY Coalition for Healthy School Food 
 
  Chinese American Parent Association (CAPA) 
  Education Through Music 
 
  New York Historical Society 
  Queens Botanical Gardens 
  The Alliance for Healthier Generation 
  Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine 
  Queens College 

 

We also believe our curriculum is an area of strength and one that distinguishes our school within our district. Our 
teachers study, write and constantly revise our curriculum in all content areas, in conjunction with Professional 
Developers. They therefore "own" curriculum in a way that enables them to tailor it to for the needs of their 
respective classes, thereby addressing the needs of our high ENLs population and our SWDs. Our curriculum is 
influenced by the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project, Sharon Taberski, Thinking Maps, and Math in the 
City. We also recognize the need to attune ourselves to the latest shifts in progressive educational pedagogy. 
Recently, we are investigating "Unison Reading" and the article "What If “Just Right” Is Just Wrong? The 
Unintended Consequences of Leveling Readers" by James Hoffman. 

Our accomplishments include but are not limited to: 

 
 

 

First vegetarian public school in the country 

  2017-18 Respect for All School 
  2015 National Blue Ribbon Award  
 
  Recipient of numerous awards and distinctions as one of the healthiest schools in the country 
  A-rated school since our inception 
  Well-Developed in all areas according to our most recent Quality Review 
  Consistently high percentages of 3/s and 4/s on NY State standardized tests 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

We have a high percentage of ENLs (75% in Kindergarten and 53% overall.) Like other schools with a high ENL 
population, we are committed to helping this population gain mastery of English and excel academically. (We will 
continue our 2nd year of offering a TBE Mandarin class in Kindergarten for the 2018-19 school year.) At the same 
time, we recognize that there are subgroups within this population, including students newly arrived to the United 
States, (within this group, there is a cohort of students who were born in the United States but were raised in China 
prior to entering PreK). We recognize that there are distinct social-emotional learning needs within our population 
of ENLs and we strive as a school community to meet these needs. Academically, we are also always looking to 
improve our model of instruction to better serve the needs of our ENLs. We will continue to expand our work with 
professional development consultants Renee Dinnerstein and Ted Kesler to help us integrate more content to our 
instruction in alignment with best practices for early-childhood learners. We are also working on integrating strong 
social studies content with our ESL instruction, utilizing best practices from the MaryAnn Cucchiarra framework. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Building trust in our school is the cornerstone of our success. We have always invited all stakeholders to participate 
and to actively contribute to their child’s education. This year, we made further inroads in nurturing Trust within 
our school community. In alignment with District 25 goals, we formed a Social Emotional Learning committee and 
met monthly on issues pertaining to our overall social/emotional well-being. We also were able to have a Guidance 
Counselor on staff 3 days a week, to provide counseling services to our students, both mandated and at-risk. We 
also instituted a Book of the Month initiative; a committee of teachers and administration selected books with 
topics centered on SEL for our whole school to utilize to continue conversations. Additionally, both members of the 
Administration attended Implicit Bias Training and Emotional Intelligence training. As a staff, we began considering 
how our own identities and our implicit biases impact how and what we teach. We took a close look at the books in 
our classrooms, to ensure that they represent our students’ identities. We began to broach topics of race, gender, 
and inclusivity at PD sessions, led both by Administration and by a cohort of teachers who attended Undoing 
Racism and Border Crossers workshops. Next year, we are committed to furthering this work as a school partner 
with Border Crossers Racial Justice in Schools Initiative.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Based on our Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments, our students consistently show growth within ELA and we 
believe that growth strongly correlates to the NY State English Language Arts (ELA) scores and expectations. In 
Kindergarten, 95% of students attained our expectation, 88% of students in 1st grade, 90% in 2nd grade and 88% in 
3rd grade. We also believe it is extremely important that we continue our focus on building students' ability to 
comprehend complex text and keep strong intervention programs for English Language Learners (ELLs). Our Quality 
Review indicates that TALES' "engaging curriculum and tasks promote rigorous habits and higher-order thinking skills 
across a majority of classrooms. Purposeful decisions to align curricula result in coherence across subjects that 
promote college and career readiness."  

 

At the same time, we are constantly looking for ways to improve our instruction and build further teacher efficacy. 
We believe that while our running records do consistently show evidence of growth that we are overemphasizing the 
role of leveled texts in instruction. As a result of our focus on leveled texts, students may be in fact limited in their 
book choices and have less opportunity to look for more compelling texts that challenge them. We are investigating 
the question of "is this "just right" level the same level that is useful for the teacher in promoting curiosity, 
comprehension, appreciation, imagination, writing or critical thinking." (What If "Just Right" is Just Wrong? by James 
Hoffman.) 

 

In considering this, over the course of the coming year we will continue to work towards sustaining and improving the 
success we have had in ELA in partnering with our consultant from Queens College and spending significant time 
building a new focus on what "just right" reading means into our curriculum.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, TALES will shift to foster students’ deeper understanding of what “Just Right Books” means to their 
own reading identities will enable students who are already reading at grade level, according to Fountas and Pinnell 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13

State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Sending home monthly curriculum letters informs families of the common core curriculum and instructional focus of 
each grade. Teachers hold regular workshops for families to help them understand how to complete homework, how 
to help their children in areas such as reading, writing, math, science and parents as art partners for visual arts and 
music. These workshops occur during Tuesday parent engagement time, evenings and morning sessions. Teachers, 
the parent coordinator and a translator (if necessary) meet with families to inform them of their child's progress at

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
 

TALES has demonstrated over the course of the last 9 years that we have a strong supportive environment where 
families want to bring their children. This continues to be evident as we had over 400 applicants for 125 Kindergarten 
seats and over 300 applicants for 36 Pre-K seats. Our Quality Review report and school survey indicate that both 
parents and teachers alike are overwhelmingly happy with the operations of the school. Furthermore, the Quality 
Review report indicates the following findings "a culture for learning is established that communicates and embeds 
high expectations shared by staff, families and students." The Quality Review report also indicates that "all members 
of the school community clearly articulate that TALES expectations are high and are supported by a culture of mutual 
accountability for teaching and learning that permeates the environment at the school."  

 

Even with this clarity in trust, interest and community, it is always important for us to strive for equity amongst all 
students and families. It is important to encourage teachers to continually reflect on the institution of education and 
what voices are heard more than others in order to ensure equitable opportunities to all students and families. We 
employ a Responsive Classroom approach throughout the building to assist us with this and have begun a partnership 
with Border Crossers for the 2018-2019 school year to continue building racial equity through examining teaching 
practices with a racial justice lens.  

 

We will continue to look for opportunities to grow our environment by working with a lens of racial equity to ensure 
that all students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers. Teachers and staff will participate in a needs 
assessment to guide us in our goal of revising curriculum and expanding our work to include an awareness of racial 
equity. 

 

These opportunities will enable us to continue growing our school-wide environment. With these changes in mind, we 
hope to attain a minimum score of 4.3 within the supportive environment section of the Framework for Great Schools 
report. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          18 

 

identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Through a one year partnership with Border Crossers, TALES will further our goal of building racial justice and 
equity within our community, as evidenced by our implementation of a racial justice initiative that will have been 
developed in consultation with Border Crossers. This will result in an increased ability as a school community to 
discuss issues of race and equity, and subsequently, the revision of (at least) one unit plan in all content areas to 
reflect stakeholder’s more in-depth understanding.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
Key to advancing our Supportive Environment goal is helping parents/families gain understanding of how race and 
racism manifest within our immediate school community and how it impacts our collective learning and growth. 
When we engage with Border Crossers in September to assess our core racial justice needs within our school, we 
will do so with the specific cohort of parents/families in mind. We will develop a long term plan to advance 
understanding of race, gender, and inclusivity for our parents/families. This likely will be in the format of hosting 
workshops to address these issues to be held for parents/families. We will provide all the information/workshop in 
translation.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

TALES is a very collaborative environment for teachers. Teachers consistently work together in planning units, 
workshops, parent meetings and often meet on their lunches, preps and other time out of school to ensure that they 
are well prepared for student success. This has been an area that TALES has been particularly strong in and is clear in 
terms of the coherence of each classroom to the grade and each grade to the school. Common planning for teachers 
occurs each week along with grade level planning and inquiry within the CCLS framework. Multiple data sources are 
used at meetings to address student needs and learning outcomes. Additionally, we regularly schedule inter-
visitations for teachers and there is a community of staff that help each other whenever the need arises.  

We will always be focused on maintaining this type of environment and looking for new ways for us all to work 
together for the benefit of our students.  

Our Quality Review indicates that "the work of teacher teams has resulted in school-wide instructional coherence, 
improved pedagogy, student work and progress." We continue to focus in this area and build a closer knit community 
to create more cohesiveness in our unit planning and strength of instruction. We will spend more time in the coming 
year working with our ELA consultant to create a stronger continuum of literacy learning and cross grade 
collaboration while ensuring that we tie the purposes of our units to the needs of students.  

The administration has utilized the collaborative environment to structure multiple teacher team inquiry cycles during 
the 2017-18 school year. Moving into the 2018-19 school year the administration plans to continue this work as a way 
to develop a deeper understanding of our individual students needs and grow teachers skills. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will engage in teacher teams at TALES evidenced by at least two guided inquiry cycles 
(led by a group facilitator), one of which will focus on the five essential elements of reading development 
(Comprehension, Fluency, Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, Vocabulary), and show competency in designing Inquiry 
Projects that improve teaching, resulting in addressing gaps in curriculum and positively impacting the achievement 
of students in need of intervention within the target groups.

TALES knows the importance of focusing on the needs of teachers and building their ability to deliver instruction and 
attend to the individual needs of students. This is of particular importance for the school because of the high 
academic standards that have been established since our inception.  

According to our Quality Review report "Teachers are guided and supervised by school leaders with extensive 
teaching experiences who provide clear expectations for pedagogical and professional practice via verbal and written 
communication, team meetings and regular meetings with the principal. There is a culture of mutual trust and 
accountability throughout the school that is evident throughout the hallways, classrooms and offices. The goals set 
forth by the principal are for deliberate and consistent expectations that strengthen and enhance the vision of the 
school." Additionally, according to the 2017-18 school quality guide, the administration scored a 4.27 in this area, 
reflecting a positive outlook of how the administration has lead the school. 

Additionally, with a score of 4.40 in the area of teacher influence, it is clear that teachers understand that they have a 
voice in developing how the school operates. TALES will focus on using this area of strength to distribute more 
leadership across the school. By getting more staff involved in committees and decision making we expect to further 
increase the collaboration within the school and develop more depth in our initiatives for students and increase 
student achievement.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
During the 2018-19 school year, TALES administration will develop and tap the leadership capacity of stakeholders in 
the school organization, resulting in at least 40% of teachers leading and running school-wide committees, resulting 
in a structure whereby leaders of tomorrow are nurtured within our school and a diverse multitude of voices 
contribute to the refinement of our vision.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, TALES received a score of 4.15 in the area of Strong Family-
Community Tie (an increase from . We received a score of 98% positive in the specific area of Outreach to Parents and 
92% positive in the specific area of Parent Involvement in School. These high percentages are consistent with the 
score of 4.99 and the rating of Well Developed that we received on our 2014-15 Quality Review. According to the 
Quality Review, "parents interviewed stated that they appreciate the commitment of the school to their children and 
appreciate the consistent and constant communication of their child's progress via e-mail, phone calls and in-person 
meetings." Other data trends that support our positive ratings include the 95% attendance that we had at Parent 
Teacher Conferences this year (an increase of 5% from 2016-17), and the 84% of parents who responded to the NYC 
School Survey (an increase of 8% from 2016-17). We also have had the highest average attendance at PTA meetings in 
the last five years. Annually, we have incredible family participation in school-wide events such as Family Dinner 
Night, Health and Wellness week, and school-wide performances. We will continue to look for opportunities to 
engage families within the school with events such as classroom celebrations, art and music events, and workshops 
geared to parent/family interests. As in previous years, workshops will be provided for families in Pre-K through 3rd 
grade and advertised on our monthly calendar.  

2. We have much to celebrate in terms of the Strong Family and Community Ties that we have established. Looking 
closely at the NYC School Survey, one sub-area continues to stand out as a priority area to address in the goal and 
action plan for this Framework Element. Like in the 2016-17 school year, only 76% of parents responded that "they 
have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support [the] school." This was an area of focus this past school year 
and since data indicates that our efforts did not result in improvement in this area, we will again focus our efforts in 
this area in order to ensure that parents feel truly welcome to volunteer their time as valued stakeholders within our 
school. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

By June 2019, TALES will have piloted a monthly "Family Visits" program based on the Family and Community 
Engagement training attended by staff, reaching out to targeted families of children who have frequent 
latenesses/absences monthly, in order to foster a school/home relationship that will result in a reduction of 
latenesses or absences of visited families by 10% from fall to spring as measured by attendance reports.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
● The school works closely with the field support center HR point in identification of highly qualified teachers. Our HR 
point supports us in ensuring our hires have the proper credentials. We require prospective teachers to conduct a 
demo lesson and attend our new teacher orientation prior to the start of school.  

● We support the retention of our teachers through continual professional development strategies both in teams and 
through individualized support as needed. The principal and the assistant principal works one-to-one with teachers to 
identify areas of support and next steps and create professional development opportunities as needed to 
demonstrate teacher growth and ensure that our teachers feel supported. All teachers have access to supplies, 
computers, and state of the art technology (with trainings) so that their pedagogy is enhanced and supports all 
learners. We also train teachers in behavioral strategies such as Responsive Classroom that support learners.  

● As required, new teachers are matched with mentors. We utilize our network as well, to identify high quality 
professional development opportunities and provide our teachers with current and research based models of 
pedagogy. 

● We have a staff handbook, new staff handbook and family handbook to help outline expectations. 

● We bring in consultants from Thinking Maps and Math in the City to help teachers develop an understanding of how 
subjects are taught at TALES. 

● Administration always has an open door policy. 

● Interviews are conducted as a committee with teacher involvement. 

● Teaching assignments are determined by assessing the needs of the school along with the strengths of teachers.

teachers to participate in the conversation around the selection or development of assessment measures. School 
leaders along with teachers have worked on developing expectations around assessments and meet on an as needed 
basis to make adjustments to assessment policies. The professional development around the use of assessment 
results is provided by a variety of sources including school leaders, data specialists, teachers and network staff. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another

purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 244 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of the Every Student Succeeds 
Act (ESSA), Title I, Part A is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

P.S. 244 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 
 

Involving parents in the development and review of program plans 
Sharing program information related to parent programs, meetings, and other activities in a format and 
language that parents can understand 

  Maintaining and engaging parents in the development and review of the district and building parent 

involvement policies 
Sharing progress reports through parent-teacher conferences, annual meetings, etc; 
Sharing information regarding curriculum, school accountability data, etc; 



● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Looking for opportunities to grow the home school connection by investing in training for home visits. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● Ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● Support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.;

● Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under ESSA Title I, Part A, Section 1118. 

● Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

● Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference as a part of back to school night in September. 

● Hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● Encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● Supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● Establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents with the parent 
coordinator; 

● Encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● Providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● Developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

P.S. 244 , in compliance with the Section 1118 of ESSA Title I, Part A, is implementing a School-Parent Compact to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and 
parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, agree that this Compact outlines how 
parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for improved academic achievement and the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure that all children achieve State Standards on 
assessments. 

Staff, family members, and students are expected to abide by this agreement which details expectations for each 
constituency. These are the “non-negotiables” of TALES. This agreement will be reviewed at school open 
houses/orientations or on a 1 to 1 basis as needed. Please review this agreement, as well as the New York City 
Discipline Code, with your child in order to clearly understand TALES’ expectations: 

 

I. School Responsibilities: High Quality Curriculum 

TALES continually reviews and updates curriculum to meet the specific needs of our students. We create our own ELA 
curriculum based on a workshop model approach with the assistance from a consultant associated with Queens 
College. We also work closely with Math in the City to develop investigations for our math curriculum. Our science 
curriculum is based on FOSS and we have created curriculum in the arts and physical education as well related to the 
mission and vision of our school. 

 

I. School Responsibilities: Supporting Home-School Relationships 

The underlying belief at TALES is that strong teaching in a caring environment combined with an intensive and holistic 
school day will stimulate the child’s mind, nourish their bodies, and develop their character. Staff, students and 
parents must each do their part to ensure that this belief is realized. We are continually looking to increase 
opportunities for families to engage with the school and support their children through focused activities and 
continuing to develop an understanding of how to help their children succeed academically, socially and emotionally. 

 

I. School Responsibilities: Providing Parents Reasonable Access to Staff 

We believe that all parents want their children to be successful. In order to do that, they must have access to staff at 
school and work closely with the teachers of their children. As such, parents have regular access to administration, 
office and teaching staff through phone, email and in person meetings. The administration and office staff greet 
students and families entering the building each morning and are present at dismissal each afternoon along with their 
teachers. We regularly plan meetings with parents before and after school in addition to during the school day. We 
provide translation to their home languages when necessary and look to provide families with any accommodation 
possible so that they can best understand the needs of their children. It is important to us that parents feel supported 
by staff and we look for opportunities to meet with families and provide them as much information as possible. 

 

I. School Responsibilities: Providing General Support to Parents 

As a staff member at TALES, I promise to: 

● Provide students with a safe, nurturing, environment. 

● Hold students to high standards and doing the best work they are capable of. 

● Share information and resources with parents that will aid in student learning. 

● Share information and resources with other staff members that will aid in student learning.

● Become an expert in the field of teaching and use the best instructional practices. 

● Assess students on a regular basis and work with students and parents to provide the best possible individualized 
instruction.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

P.S. 244 will offer supplemental language development extended day programs consisting of 
seventy minute sessions on Wednesdays, and Thursdays. After school programs for all grades 
will commence during the week of December 3 and end on May 23rd. There will be 
approximately 40 sessions. Teachers holding ESL and dual certification in ESL and general 
education will be given preference when considering service providers and qualifications. The 
after school programs will be taught in English by at least five teachers who hold ESL or ESL 
and general education dual certifications. The program will target at least 80 of our struggling 
English Language Learners. All participating teachers will have their own classrooms to conduct 
their after school programs. Students will be grouped for instruction by having a student to 
teacher ratio of 10:1. There are two Kindergarten classes, 2 first grade classes, 3 third grade 
classes and 2 classes of mixed grades.  A supervisor will be hired for the language development 
after-school program since there are no other programs running concurrently. 
In addition to the extended day program, we will offer before school morning classes.  These 
groups will begin the week of November 8 and continue to the beginning of May.  The classes 
will be from 7:50am - 8:20am on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  We will have 4 
Kindergarten classes, 2 first grade classes, 3 second grade classes, 4 third grade classes and 2 
mixed age classes.  ENL teachers were given first priority in the selection of teachers as is the 
case in our extended day program.  Of the fifteen classes, four will be taught by ENL licensed 
teachers and we will have at least 140 ENL students in these groups.  A supervisor does not need 
to be hired for this program since it falls within the principals normal work hours. 
Students selected for the after school programs will be divided into groups based on academic 
need, interest, teacher speciality and level of English proficiency as demonstrated on the Spring 
2017 NYSESLAT. Results from the NYSESLAT exam, Home Language survey and teacher 
observations in social and academic setting has supported our focus on our after school program 
rationale. We will analyze the NYSESLAT results for each grade band of students, highlighting 
those that showed a slower rate of growth and target those students for the morning and extended 
day programs provided the families are able to bring them and pick them up.  Historically we 
have seen a slightly lower rate of growth in oral language development as compared to the other 
areas tested.  As such, we will pay particular attention to that area in NYSESLAT results.  Each 
teacher will focus on listening/ speaking/ reading and writing standards through a different theme 
with his/her students; such as music, visual arts, health, running, technology and drama. 
This wide range of academic topics offered has defined our after school rationale and will help 
English Language Learners in the following ways: they will be exposed to numerous themes of 
interest; they may extend their learning in the classroom with extracurricular projects; through a 
wide range of readings and topics they will be exposed to an increased number of content area 
vocabulary words and they will receive opportunities to hear and practice new vocabulary words 
and language structures in a small-group setting. Each theme will be focused on projects and 
intervention services which will allow ELLs to fully immerse themselves in various language 
activities and modalities.  Home language is taken into consideration when pairing students 
within the classroom. Students are encouraged to help each other by translating in their home 
language whenever possible.They will also be paired by their NYSESLAT levels. When

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
completing certain tasks within the after school program, teachers will pair a low beginner ELL 
with a high advanced ELL. A translator is available to communicate in the parents’ home 
language during all school meetings and workshops. Letters, notifications and monthly 
curriculum letters are translated as well to help support the home language. 
Students for the morning program are for the most part selected by their classroom teacher based 
on similar criteria as stated for the extended day program above. Additional criteria for the 
morning program include the need for increased oral social language and a demonstrated need to 
increase writing skills as demonstrated by common rubrics throughout each grade. 
70% of Title III funding will be set aside to pay teachers (ENL teachers given preference in 
hiring) for the duration of the extended day and morning programs which will run through May.) 
8% of Title III funding will be used for parent engagement to supplement Title I parent 
engagement funding in order to purchase Cool Culture passes for families, materials for parent 
workshops and supplies for cultural festivals.  
14% of Title III will be used to provide professional development services to teachers. These 
sessions will focus on improving instruction and strategies used to help support our English 
Language learners. 
8%  of Title III will also be used to purchase materials for the following programs for after 
school: art ( i.e.- crayons, clay, paint etc.), music (instruments), drama (poster boards, camera), 
as well as  other materials such as theme appropriate books for the language development after-
school program. Materials purchased for after school will be specifically be used for their 
designated program. These materials will not be used for daily instruction during the school day. 
Attendance for these programs is kept through in house produced spreadsheets and notification 
of selection for both programs is done via letter home to parents/ phone call to parents or in 
person discussions.  All parent letters for the programs is translated into Mandarin to ensure 
understanding.

Professional Development is an integral part of teacher growth.  As such, all teachers receive 
professional development on a regular basis.  ESL instructional strategies are covered directly 
through focused workshops or as a part of topics dealing with other instructional areas.  All after 
school professional development sessions on site are on Mondays for 80 minutes. Teachers will 
be responsible for maintaining their own agendas and will have it available for administration to 
view. Attendance sheets will be collected at the end of each week by the parent coordinator and 
then filed in a binder. Any invitations in the parents’ preferred language will also be collected by 
the parent coordinator and filed. 
We have worked on developing our fluency in Thinking Maps (TM) under the guidance of the 
Assistant Principal.  Recently, two classrooms teachers have been trained as trainers in addition 
to our Assistant Principal and they have begun to also provide ongoing PD support to the rest of 
the staff to further develop our fluency in Thinking Maps.  They will utilize Thinking Maps 
Learning Community (TMLC), which is an on-line application that we purchase for all staff to 
utilize that provides training modules for teachers, as well as a tool to create maps with 
students.  This has direct application to ENL strategies because it enables our TOT leaders to

Part C: Professional Development  
further help teachers grow their bank of ENL strategies.  We will continue to send additional 
teachers to TOT training in order to ensure that there is one member on each grade that has a 
deeper level of proficiency in the maps. 
We also have Janan Hamm (Math in the City certified instructor) conducting at minimum 15 
days of professional development throughout the year to help us develop a more thinking math 
curriculum and opportunities for talk through a math congress and building more conceptual 
understanding for students in math.   
In addition, we have Ted Kesler, professor at Queens College, coming in for 20 professional 
development sessions.  Mr. Kesler's role is to help our staff deepen their knowledge of content 
and pedagogy, specifically in ELA in the areas of Shared Reading and Guided Reading with an 
understanding that 53% of our students are ELLs.  <!--
{cke_protected}%3Cmeta%20charset%3D%22utf-8%22%20%2F%3E-->Next year, we will 
focus on guiding our students to be more independent when selecting a variety of complex and 
compelling texts. These texts will serve a love of reading,strengthen the home to school 
connection, build a richer vocabulary and expand oral language development. Additional 
professional development sessions that we anticipate include but are not limited to utilizing Juicy 
Sentences, front-loading content and vocabulary by integrating subject areas, and improving our 
questioning and discussion opportunities, various methods of building vocabulary, all of which 
are essential strategies in working with ELLs.   
In addition, teachers will receive on going ENL Professional Development throughout the school 
year with our ENL consultant, Pat Lo. By attending her scheduled in house PD sessions, teachers 
will implement the ENL strategies into their after school programs. Pat Lo will be scheduled at 
least 2 times throughout the year during Monday PD time from 2:40- 4:00.  Also, she will meet 
with teachers at least 6 times for whole day teacher collaborative meetings. Also, teachers will be 
encouraged to seek and attend PD related specifically to their after school focus, especially 
through the Field Support Center and DELLS.    
Examples of additional upcoming PD sessions include but are not limited to:  Curriculum 
Planning, Nurturing Talk During Guided Reading, Math Congress, Shared Reading.  The 
majority of these sessions will be lead by the principal and consultants, with some ESL teachers 
co-leading the workshops. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
Describe the parent engagement activities targeted toward parents of ELLs that will impact 
higher achievement for ELLs.  NOTE: These are in addition to mandated activities, such as 
parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Begin description here:            
We have seen from Home Language Survey data that the majority of our students speak another 
language at home.  Therefore, there is a significant need for a number of additional services to 
target the parents of ELLs to impact their achievement.  We make sure that all major 
communication such as family handbooks, curriculum letters, parent teacher conference or 
calendar notices are translated into families' home languages.  We schedule workshops including 
reading, writing, math, and family health sessions for parents conducted by our parent 
coordinator, classroom teachers, Cornell Cooperative Extension, Assistant Principal and 
FAN4Kids instructor on topics including (but not limited to):

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
- Reading at home with your child, Nutrition at home, Cool culture workshop, Completing 
homework, Reading aloud with your child at home, How to do Thinking Maps, Math games, 
Family crafts, Cooking with your kids, Writing strategies and solutions, & Responsible Use of 
Technology.  Multiple other parent workshops are being planned by teachers and we will 
have other activities including but not limited to concerts, family dinner nights, yoga nights, 
movie nights, visual arts student work shows, writing celebrations and multiple festivals.  Parents 
will participate in the events by either actively engaging with the students as they explain their 
work through an art class as an example or through the workshop format where parents and 
families are learning from the presenter directly. 
Workshops are scheduled during Parent Teacher Engagement time every Tuesday from 2:40- 
3:20. Parents are notified by flyers that go home in their communications folders which are 
translated into Mandarin and also by using the Remind app and from the school calendar. 
Agendas and attendance sheets are kept by the teachers, parent coordinator and the principal for 
the various workshops. Each grade schedules a parent workshop at least once a month. The 
parent coordinator also conducts a workshop at least once a month for approximately 45 minutes 
to 1 hour. All materials are translated into Mandarin, the language spoken by the majority of our 
students families. All parents are encouraged to participate in scheduled workshops, after school 
programming and other scheduled events. Depending on the event, parents experience the 
following: working collaboratively with teachers and other parents, participating in hands on 
learning, being a model of how to be healthy/fit and volunteering their time to help organize and 
manage these events. They will be notified of all events by receiving an invitation in English and 
in their own home language. These events are added to our School to Home calendar that is sent 
out each month for parents to see the scheduled activities. Also, parents are updated with current 
PS244Q news with the REMIND app.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
    TALES will use Fountas and Pinnell as the main diagnostic tool for monitoring student success relating to literacy levels and 
their understanding of phonics and phonemic awareness.  Students are also assessed using teacher created assessments such 
as think pair share, purposeful grouping for collaborative work, whole group, small group and partnership discussion for all 
subject areas, as well as student friendly self assessments.  They are assessed using the NYSITELL upon entering Kindergarten 
and again in the spring using the NYSESLAT.  In using the data from these assessments we regularly see a trend that our ELL 
students are stronger in writing and reading than in oral language.  As a result, we have planned an instructional focus around 
integrating more and better talk opportunities throughout our curriculum.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

Some structures in place are weekly common planning sessions where teachers analyze data and use the data to plan 
accordingly. Teachers attend PD workshops and turnkey to the staff during weekly staff meetings. There are ENL and literacy 
consultants who come in on a monthly basis to support teachers in assessing students.  We will also ensure that Monday PD 
sessions focus on inquiry team work at least once per month. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
    The success of our ENL programs is monitored through Fountas and Pinnell assessment data, NYSITELL and NYSESLAT scores, 
in-house end-of-unit assessments, and informal classroom assessments.  The success of students on these assessments 
determines our program success .  We are consistently meeting AYP and seeing yearly success.  Since students usually need a 
minimum of three to five years to become fully proficient in a second language, our goal is to achieve significant student 
progress on a year to year basis, as measured by the various assessments used at the school and on the NYSESLAT.  As 
previously mentioned, we routinely find that oral language development is an area of need for our ELL students as compared 
to reading and writing. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The intervention structures in place include strategy groups, homogeneous grouping, Language Literacy 
Intervention, SETTS, RTI, at-risk intervention, Reading Recovery, before and after-school programs, and AIS periods set aside 
for ENL teachers to work with small groups. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
    There is a strong language and literacy curriculum in place for all ELL students, with ENL-certified cluster teachers, dedicated 
ENL push-in staff for each grade, and  ENL-certified classroom teachers.  If an ELL student seems to be encountering academic 
delays, we first informally evaluate the student in their native language, to determine if the student is also showing delays in 
their first language.  If the student is proficient in their L1, but still struggling academically, we elicit more information (from 
both teachers and parents/guardians) about the student's learner characteristics, classroom experiences, and home 
situation.  We also use the results of various diagnostics, including NYSITELL scores, most recent NYSESLAT scores, and in-
house language acquisition assessments, as well as observations, conference notes, and anecdotal information from the 
classroom teacher.  If it is determined that a student's delays are due to factors aside from level of language acquisition, the 
teacher works with our SETTS specialist to enact some classroom interventions.  After a series of informal interventions have 
failed to help the student make academic gains, the student's case is referred to our school's SBST for further discussion. 
    If it is determined that the child's academic delays are likely due entirely to language acquisition, extra supports are 
provided to give the student additional exposure to English.  This includes, but is not limited to, before-school academic 
intervention, small group work, daily push-in social-studies classes taught using ENL methodologies, after-school enrichment 
activities, and various scaffolding techniques aimed at allowing students to find meaning in difficult language structures.  
    If, after the informal L1 evaluation and targeted interventions, the student is still struggling, a formal evaluation may be 
recommended. 
    Our RTI interventions include small group instruction for ELL students daily with a ENL certified teacher pushing into each 
classroom for one period.  We also have a reading recovery teacher for first grade and a SETTS teacher that schedules time for 
students at risk daily.  We now have a guidance counselor two days a week instead of one and have both early morning and 
extended day opportunities for ELL students to extend their opportunities to gain language.   
  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
    NYSITELL scores indicate that many of the incoming Kindergarten students have very rudimentary oral English skills, with the 
vast majority of students entering at the Entering or Emerging levels.  NYSESLAT scores show that our students have strong 
academic English skills, and many students attain proficiency on the reading/writing modalities before doing so on the 
speaking/listening sections.  NYSESLAT scores also indicate that our ELLs become increasingly proficient in English as they 
move into the upper grades; although approximately 80% of Kindergarten ELLs are at the Entering/Emerging level, the vast 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

majority of our upper grade ELLs (70% of first graders, 98% of second graders, and 96% of third graders) are at the 
Expanding/Commanding level. 
     Beginning this year we will use the NYSITELL information to help us work with parents and fill our first TBE Kindergarten 
class.  This information is also used to group students once they are placed in classrooms.  The ENL push-in teacher groups 
students to work with them daily based on their established needs according to the assessment.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The results of the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT are used to create an ELL Target List which is disseminated to teachers and support 
staff in September.  This list is used to create language proficiency level groups for all subject areas, as well as for selecting 
students for intervention and before- and -after school programs. 
Teacher use the data from these assessments in their planning and it will be used in inquiry teams as well.  ENL push-in staff 
will meet together weekly and use the data as a part of their regular meetings.  Each push-in staff member regularly works 
with classroom teachers to plan which students they will be working with daily and the content that is delivered.  This data will 
also be used in planning with an ENL consultant to make adjustments to curriculum and plan small group instruction. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

All ELLs at TALES are serviced with a combination of push-in and co-teaching.  ENL is taught using various 
methodologies through content areas.   The stand-alone portion of our ENL program is conducted by TESOL-certified 
teachers, Rebecca Kaizerman (Kindergarten), Magda Kowalczyk (first grade), Denise Levitt (second grade) and Teresa 
Dubin (third grade).  Each class in K-3 has one 45-minute period of daily ENL time with the push-in teacher, who 
spends half the period teaching the whole group and half the period working with small groups.    
The integrated ENL portion of our curriculum occurs in our cluster positions (Language through Music, Language 
through Movement, and Science), all of which are taught by TESOL-certified teachers using ENL methodologies. Every 
student in the school attends these integrated ENL cluster positions six times a week, which provides 270 minutes of 
integrated ENL instruction, well in excess of the minimum 180 minutes of integrated instruction for Expanding and 
Former ELLs.  As mentioned before, standalone ENL teachers push in to all Kindergarten through third grade 
classrooms. 
All students at TALES remain with their classes for the entire day, and classes have heterogeneous populations of non-
ELLs and ELLs of varying proficiency levels.  Therefore, ENL methodologies are used to teach all students at various 
times of the day (both through whole-group push-in and content cluster classes), while more homogeneous small-
groups focus on oral language acquisition and provide time for ELLs to practice new skills with teachers and 
peers.  The combination of whole-class and small-group language instruction allows us to ensure that proficient ELLs 
continue to receive essential language instruction even after passing the NYSESLAT. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our first TBE Mandarin class begins in Kindergarten this year.  These students have tested into ENL through the 
NYSITELL and the parents expressed interest in having their children placed in this setting.  There will not be any other 
requirements for a child to be placed in the class aside from their English proficiency level and parent choice.  Within 
this class, an ENL teacher will push-in for one period a day, the same as every other Kindergarten class, and be 
ensured the minimum requirements of ENL instruction.  The classroom teacher will teach Home Language Arts, 
Shared Reading and Math in Mandarin.  The classroom will be labeled with words and picture support to guide

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Each student at TALES receives 225 minutes per week of push-in ENL instruction, divided equally between stand-alone 
ENL and integrated ENL social studies instruction.  All students also receive 90 minutes per week of science content taught 
using ENL strategies.  Finally, each student receives between 45 and 90 minutes of music and physical education per week, 
with both classes taught by certified ENL teachers using sheltered English instruction. 
In the TBE Kindergarten class, students will receive the same amount of instructional minutes mentioned above. They will also 
be taught in Mandarin to meet the mandated minutes during Home Language Arts, Shared Reading and math. 
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
       One of our instructional models at TALES is a Freestanding ENL program.  Through this program, instruction is delivered in 
English.   ENL, cluster, and classroom teachers use Total Physical Response (TPR), songs, hands-on activities, and cooperative 
learning to integrate authentic language use across the four language modalities each day.  Content and language objectives 
are clearly defined for students, and are appropriate for the age level.  Supplementary materials, such as visuals, models, and 
manipulatives, are used to a high-degree. ENL instruction is enhanced by the use of SmartBoards and voice amplification 
systems, found in every classroom.  
              TBE is another instructional model that will be in one Kindergarten class beginning this school year.  In the 
TBE Kindergarten class, students will be taught in Mandarin for Home Language Arts, Shared Reading and Math.  The 
classroom teacher will give students specific supports in their home language throughout the day in addition to these specific 
curriculum areas. 
              It is evident that our ENL students meet the demands of the NYS learning standards when analyzing our state test 
results including NYSESLAT, ELA and Math.  Each year we rank in the top 5% of NYC schools for achievement on the 
NYS ELA and Math exams, including the high percentage of ELL students that we have.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

       Because all instruction takes place in English, most ELLs are not evaluated in their home languages. However, Chinese-
speaking incoming Kindergarten students with limited English are given as many supports as possible in their home language 
by staff members that can speak their home language. 
               In our TBE classroom, students will be given multiple supports in their home language as they increase their English 
language proficiency through the year.  As the purpose of a TBE class is to transition students into English, all assessments will 
be in English including the NYSESLAT, Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments and all in school created rubrics. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a) and d) Since our school only goes up to third grade, and almost all newcomers enter our school in second grade or earlier, 
we have not had any SIFE students identified in our school. since we opened in 2008.  Our school also has no long-term ELLs, 
since none of our students have had more than five years of ENL service. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

b) We do have many newcomer ELLs (0 – 3 years of service) at TALES, but they are for the most part concentrated in 
Kindergarten.  The few new admits that come in first grade or after tend to have at least one year of ENL instruction when they 
enroll at our school.  Since we have many newcomer ELLs in Kindergarten, each student spends 495 minutes per week being 
taught language and content by certified TESOL pedagogues [225 minutes of push-in ESL, 90 minutes of Language through 
Science, 90 minutes of Language through Music, and 90 minutes of Language through Movement].  In addition, instruction for 
our ELLs is differentiated by grouping students homogeneously in all of the language modalities.   
c) Because we are an early childhood school, the only grade with Developing ELLs (4 – 6 years of service) is third 
grade.  Developing ELLs comprise only ten percent of our total ELL population, and over 90% of our Developing ELLs are at the 
Commanding proficiency level.  Moreover, the vast majority of these Developing ELLs are proficient in the reading and writing 
modalities, indicating that their oral English skills (especially Speaking) are holding them back from proficient status.  Because 
of this trend, Developing ELLs are given the opportunity for before-school AIS and after-school enrichment activities to 
increase their opportunities to speak English in smaller groups.  In addition, the Developing ELLs are grouped heterogeneously 
to help strengthen their oral English skills. 
e) Finally, our Recently Proficient ELLs continue to receive the same ENL instruction as their Expanding peers, with 90 minutes 
of sheltered science instruction, and between 45 and 90 minutes each language through music or language through 
movement, both taught using ENL methodologies.  Recently proficient ELLs also receive language instruction in small groups, if 
deemed appropriate by the classroom and ENL teachers.  Finally, all ELLs remain on our in-house ELL Target List for two years 
after attaining proficiency via the NYSESLAT, to ensure that they receive relevant accommodations on standardized tests. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL students with disabilities are exposed to many of the same teaching methodologies as general education students, while 
also accounting for differentiated levels of instruction necessary to address the SWD population.  Among the strategies and 
materials used are: Total Physical Response (TPR), visuals, gestures, manipulatives, repetition, language modification, songs, 
charts, Think Pair Share, and direct instruction of vocabulary and lexical language objectives.  Grade-level materials for 
providing both academic content and accelerating English language development include: Fundations, MyOn, On Our Way to 
English guided reading materials, LLI, an extensive listening library, VoiceThread, BookFlix, Learning A-Z, vocabulary and 
phonics instructional tools, and content-area SmartBoard resources. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
ELL students with disabilities are mainstreamed into general education classes for 20% of each school day.  They are integrated 
into general education classes for content education (science, movement, music), which provides these students with a variety 
of peer models in a less restrictive environment.  Some ELL-SWDs are integrated into mainstream classes for an additional 
period each day, and every effort is made for them to push in during times that will maximize their opportunities for oral 
interactions with peers (e.g., playtime in the lower grades, project time in the upper grades).  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
      TALES employs a push-in model, in which ENL teachers split their time between intensive small-group sessions and whole 
group language instruction.  All ELLs are exposed to the language curriculum through whole-group activities, but those 
students with greater language needs receive additional small-group intervention from both ESL and classroom teachers.  ELLs 
receive extra targeted interventions for ELA during Extended Day after-school instruction and morning AIS sessions.  We also 
use the Fountas & Pinnell word study and LLI  programs to promote vocabulary and language development.  Several ENL 
students also receive SETTS services from our full-time SETTS provider, in order to bolster their academic progress.  Fundations 
is also used as an intervention for Kindergarten ELLs struggling with phonics and phonemic awareness.   All instruction takes 
place in English, though unofficial bilingual support is available from teachers and staff members who speak students' native 
languages.  
      Our mathematics curriculum, created in house to address the specific needs of our student population, pays explicit 
attention to the various language functions necessary for success in mathematics.  Moreover, our use of Math in the City gives 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

students experience with critical thinking and expression of their thought processes.  Additionally, every room also has a math 
word wall and math-based literature in the classroom library, to provide ELLs with extra support in attaining proficiency in 
mathematical language.  Classroom teachers work with a math consultant to generate intervention and support for our ELLs in 
math.   
     The ENL push-in model includes teaching through social studies content in all grade levels.  The intent is to improve 
students’ content knowledge while simultaneously supporting their language development through ENL methodologies.  Our 
push-in ENL staff will continue to work on this Language through Social Studies curriculum, where students will receive 110 
minutes per week of integrated social studies and ENL instruction.  Other content classes, such as science, music and physical 
education, are also taught by ENL-certified pedagogues who use ENL methodologies to make content more accessible to ELLs. 
    ELLs are also supported through the school-wide focus on questioning and discussion within Danielson's domain 3B.  As a 
result of this focus, we have integrated units on oral storytelling in Kindergarten and a debate in 3rd grade as well as more 
opportunities for language throughout each grade.  Our goal is to give students more opportunities to practice using academic 
language on a regular basis.  The school also uses Thinking Maps as a way to organize student thought, and a school-wide 
Thinking Maps culture provides ELLs with a strong scaffold for writing and speaking activities.   Moreover, to increase 
opportunities for meaningful and motivated student oral interaction, we are gradually implementing a project-work 
component in all the grades.  Finally, we support ELL learning by expanding students' experience with the English environment 
outside of school, through neighborhood walking trips, visits to community places, and culturally-instructive visits from outside 
performers.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

    We plan to expand our morning programming for the upcoming school year for ELL students. These groups will have ten or 
fewer students and will focus primarily on literacy skills; priority will be given to ELLs who are not meeting necessary literacy 
benchmarks.  The Kindergarten classes may have a larger capacity provided that they are focusing on social language 
development through play centers and/ or inquiry based work. 
    In addition, we will be planning to expand our afternoon extended day program, which offers students opportunities to 
enhance their oral English skills while engaging in such activities as cooking, gardening, running, and game-playing.  The 
afternoon groups are more heterogeneous, and include ELLs of all proficiency levels with native-English-speakers to encourage 
rich interactive dialogue. We will also be experimenting with multi-grade extended day groups, with the aim of having older 
students support the language development of younger ELLs. 
    Additionally, based on observations of the amount of student talk in our classrooms, we are planning on working more with 
the Think-Pair-Share model of student discussion in 2nd and 3rd grade as proposed by Ivannia Soto.  We expect that this 
process will increase the amount of student academic talk and the number of tier 2 and 3 words used by students in those 
conversations.   
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

    At this time, there are no plans to discontinue any of the programs or services for the ELLs at our school. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
    All students have equal access to all programs at TALES.  ELLs are integrated into each classroom, and ELLs’ programs are 
indistinguishable from those of general education students, with the exception of more frequent small-group interventions 
(and priority in certain after-school language enrichment activities) for ELLs.  ELLs participate in after-school classes, class trips, 
community visits, school festivals, and special family programs offered during Parent Engagement time, which are run by the 
school.  Additionally, all of our cluster positions (science, movement, and music) are taught by ENL-certified pedagogues, who 
seamlessly integrate language instruction with content objectives.   
    To promote participation of ELLs in school programs, all notices are sent home in both English and Chinese, the latter being 
the home language of the vast majority of our ELLs.  In addition, parents of ELLs who do not respond to written invitations for 
intervention or enrichment activities are contacted by phone in their native language to ensure maximum participation of 
students in our school programs. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

    ESL methodologies are included throughout the curriculum, in all classes and content areas.  Math instruction for ELLs is 
supported through Math in the City, which supports student learning through visual and kinesthetic means, and a Math in the 
City consultant regularly works with teachers of all grade levels to improve math instruction. Children spend all day in a 
literacy-rich environment, supported by organized classroom libraries, guided reading selections, take-home books, listening 
libraries, word walls, and personal word walls, with picture support.  Voice amplification systems in every room ensure that all 
ELLs benefit from teacher modeling of language structures.  SmartBoards have now been installed in all rooms, both to 
enhance content instruction and to provide supplemental support to ELLs through pictures, animated visuals, and 
videos.  Additionally, each classroom has between two and four iPads, which are used to practice literacy skills and listen to 
stories, and some teachers have begun experimenting with iPad software to record observational assessments.   In addition to 
the above mentioned hardware, our school has software and website subscriptions to Bookflix, Raz-Kids, MyOn, Teaching A-Z, 
Starfall, and Time for Kids online. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Because our ELLs are currently serviced through a Freestanding ENL program, all official instruction takes place in English, 
though when possible informal L1 support is used to both promote comprehension and accelerate the English acquisition 
process.  Almost all of our Entering ELLs are in Kindergarten and are speakers of Mandarin, and since our Kindergarten push-in 
ESL teacher is fluent in Mandarin, L1 support is frequently used to scaffold learning for Kindergarteners.   Additionally, because 
the vast majority of our ELLs speak Chinese at home, all school-wide notices are translated into Chinese, and our parent 
coordinator is available to provide translation support to ELLs and parents of ELLs who speak Hindi, Bengali, or Telugu. There 
are also two bilingual staff members available to assist and translate for speakers of Spanish.  Finally, bilingual books with 
Chinese or Spanish components are available from a lending library in the parent coordinator's office. 
 
In our TBE classroom, the teacher will orally support students in their home language throughout the school day. They will 
receive instruction in Mandarin in Home Language Arts, Shared Reading and Math.  Additionally, the teacher will label the 
classroom in both Mandarin and English and provide students with books in Mandarin that they can browse in school and 
bring home to read with their families.   
 
 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

   At our school, a student's grade generally determines the primary focus of ENL instruction.   Because our beginning ELLs are 
concentrated almost exclusively in Kindergarten, the Kindergarten ENL curriculum focuses heavily on oral and aural BICS (Basic 
Interpersonal Communication Skills).  As ELLs advance into the upper grades, more elements of literacy are brought into the 
curriculum.  However, since many of our ELLs attain proficiency on the reading and writing modalities of the NYSESLAT before 
doing so on the speaking and listening modalities, the upper grade ENL curriculum also addresses students' oral expression and 
fluency in English. 
    In order to ensure continuity of language education as ELLs advance through the grades, our school has created a "language 
proficiency continuum," which determines which language objectives will be addressed – for exposure or mastery – in 
different grades.  This not only ensures that all important aspects of English acquisition have been taught or introduced 
between Kindergarten and third grade, but also allows both classroom and ENL teachers to know which skills were introduced 
in previous years. 
   Beginning in September 2017, each grade will asses ELLs oral proficiency level, and track their progress, using a teacher 
created checklist.  The checklist will serve as a tool to ensure they are receiving the appropriate services and resources to 
continue to strengthen their oral language skills. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school does not share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

    Because we are a lottery school, and not a zone school, we rarely have ELLs enroll at our school after the end of 
September.  Therefore, we have not needed to create special activities or curriculum to support port-of-entry ELLs coming in 
throughout the year.  However, we do provide support to incoming K students and their families before they officially begin 
school in September.  These include several open house sessions between January and June of the previous school year, which 
are organized by our principal, assistant principal, and parent coordinator.  There are also school readiness workshops 
throughout the year, most run by community organizations, which aim to help parents of newly-enrolled students navigate an 
unfamiliar school system.  Because the majority of our students’ parents speak Mandarin Chinese, workshops are provided in 
both English and Mandarin whenever possible.  
    Perspective ELLs who are enrolled in summer camp during the summer before Kindergarten are informally observed to 
assess student needs, as are students who attend our Pre-K program.  Additionally, we set up introduction sessions for 
students to meet their Kindergarten teacher and introduce them to the school environment in small groups with parents in 
attendance.  Additional summer support is provided to students going into first through third grades, through a reading 
program that specifically targets low-performing ELLs.  Finally, each year we hold a Back to School night within the first few 
weeks of school, to inform parents about our school culture and community. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Because we are an early childhood school, no 'electives' are offered. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
    TALES has made a concerted effort to train all staff in ENL methodologies across the four modalities of speaking, listening, 
reading, and writing.  Push-in ENL teachers participate in the common planning meetings of the grade(s) they service, in order 
to maintain an ELL-oriented focus when reviewing, critiquing, and rewriting the curriculum.   
    All teachers work with our Math in the City consultant, to integrate vocabulary and oral language opportunities with our 
math curriculum.  All Pre-K and Kindergarten teachers and para-professionals work with an early childhood consultant to bring 
elements of the project approach to our reading and writing curriculum, with the aim of increasing student opportunities for 
English dialogue among students.  Teachers and the Assistant Principal have also attended Thinking Maps conferences focusing 
on Response to Literature and Comprehension Focus, two aspects of literacy that many of our ELLs struggle with.  We will also 
be seeking further PD opportunities from outside presenters through the Department of English Language Learners and 
Student Support. 
    Additionally, our certified ENL teachers attend ENL and content-area workshops, and then turnkey important information 
learned during staff meetings.  The plan is to continue to incorporate more teacher-led sessions next year.   
     Teachers and para-professionals have structured professional development sessions on Mondays after school, focusing on 
ENL curriculum and ELL students.  Since our ELL data shows that our students need to work on expressive language skills, our 
PD schedule will continue to include workshops on how to increase and improve our ELLs' oral language abilities.  The principal 
maintains records of all PD sessions, in a binder, which not only lists the attendees, but also describes the content of each 
session.  Furthermore, each teacher keeps track of their own PD hours for certification purposes. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

Our School Based Support Team are in the building once per week, are fluent in Mandarin, and attend trainings related to ELL 
and SPED needs through the BFSC. 
  
Our Parent Coordinator attends monthly trainings through the district office in addition to a yearly Cool Culture workshop and 
parent engagement workshops when possible.   
   
    All professional and staff development, as well as all curriculum created in-house, are carefully aligned to Common Core 
Learning Standards.  In addition to the previously listed activities.  We are working on increasing the number of interschool 
visits, to exchange best practices and new ideas with ENL teachers outside our school environment.  Finally, our school will 
fund conference fees for teachers who attend meetings focusing on bilingual education or TESOL. 
 
   Beginning in September 2017, our school will begin inquiry groups where the ENL team will focus solely on methods and 
strategies to support ELLs.  Twice a month, grade and team meetings will center around inquiry.  We also expect to send ENL 
teachers to more professional development through the BFSC this year as we have developed a strong relationship with 
them.  In addition, we plan to continue looking for PD opportunities through NYU and Fordham as we did this year.  We also 
work with an ENL consultant through NYU who comes at least 6 days a year to work specifically with ENL teachers during the 
day and then with the whole staff on occasion during Monday PD sessions. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Since 62% of our student population consists of ELLs, almost all of our PD sessions focus on some aspect of understanding, 
engaging, instructing, and assessing English Language Learners.   
Our school makes sure to dedicate 15% of professional development hours to a focus our ELLs.  This includes discussing 
student needs, best practices, and next steps.  In addition, our ENL and bilingual teachers receive 50% of ELL-specific 
professional development through an ENL consultant who comes in once a month, as well as through PD workshops held 
outside the school. 
An agenda is decided upon and shared, prior to all PD sessions.  Attendance and minutes are taken to ensure accurate record 
keeping.  As of September 2017, the principal will maintain records of all PD sessions online.  Furthermore, each teacher keeps 
track of their own PD hours for certification purposes.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
    Parents of ELLs will be invited to attend individual meetings during the weekly Parent Engagement time block.  The focus will 
be the discussion of their child’s language development progress, assessment results, and language development needs.  All 
meetings will be led by the classroom and push-in ENL teacher, who will compile necessary information from all ENL cluster 
teachers to provide an overall view of the student’s English language progress.   We have bilingual staff members available to 
translate meetings in the dominant languages in our school -- Mandarin, Cantonese, Bengali, and Spanish.   On the rare 
occasions when a non-English speaking parent or guardian does not speak one of these four languages, translation services will 
be provided via the DOE's Translation and Interpretation Unit. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

    TALES has made a strong commitment to parent involvement at the school.  To promote maximum attendance at school 
functions, all documents are translated into Chinese, which is the home language of the vast majority of our students.  One of 
our school aides is fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and she is always available to help Chinese-speaking parents who come to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

main office.  In addition, our ESL coordinator and assistant principal are both fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and are able to 
provide translation support for conferences, parent meetings, and other issues dealt with outside of the main office.   Our SBST 
team also has four members who are fluent in Mandarin, and they are able to provide translation support at IEP meetings. 
Moreover, most of the other languages spoken in our students' homes are spoken by at least one staff member, so non-
Chinese parents can also receive bilingual support from TALES staff.  In the rare cases when neither a written nor oral 
translation is available for a non-English-speaking parent, the school utilizes the NYCDOE's Translation and Interpretation unit. 
Additionally, many teachers utilize Class Dojo as a tool to communicate with parents. Class Dojo offers a translation option to 
see messages in over 25 different languages. 
    Some of the activities being done to increase parent participation in school functions include:  Back to School night, Fall 
Festival, monthly Chuck-E-Cheese fundraisers, Health and Wellness week, Field Day, Family Dinner Night, Family Zumba night, 
and bimonthly Movie Nights.  Our school also fosters partnerships with Music for Many, the New York Historical Society, 
Fan4Kids, and the New York Coalition for Healthy foods, all of which do performances for families at PTA 
functions.  Additionally, parent workshops are provided by such organizations as the Cornell Cooperative Extension, the Child 
Center of New York.  Almost all workshops are attended by a Chinese translator, in order to make the workshop content 
comprehensible to the large number of Chinese-speaking parents at our school.  Finally, students' families are invited to 
publishing parties and student performances, and are involved in class trips whenever possible.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Robert Groff, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Our first step in identifying the language needs of parents and guardians is to make sure that the home language 
listed in ATS reflects the home language listed on the HLIS form. Once ATS has the correct OTELE for each child, 
we download the RPOB (ATS Place of Birth Report) into an Excel spreadsheet, and then sort students by OTELE 
code to indicate the number of speakers of each language. This spreadsheet is then compared to the last entry of 
the second page of the HLIS form (where parents are asked to indicate preferences for oral and written 
communication), to make sure no parents are requesting communication in a language other than English or 
Chinese (the primary languages spoken at our school). Staff can also view the parent’s chosen language of 
communication on the Student Emergency Contact cards. Because the vast majority of our students come from 
homes where Chinese is spoken, most documents are sent out to all parents in both English and Chinese.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  From the list of parents’ preferred languages provided in the previous question, list any languages that represent at 

least a 10% population (minimum 20 families) of your school or more (excluding Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, 
French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Russian, Spanish and Urdu). If this is not applicable to your school please write N/A. 
 

Only Mandarin and English represent more than 10% of the school. 

 

 
 
Part B: Communications Calendar & Language Services 
 
1.  List the documents your school typically disseminates every year that require translation, roughly when they will be 

distributed to families, and plans to translate the documents.

interpretation service(s)?  

The teachers on each grade gather 
together in one room to host parents. 
Parents are also given the opportunity to 
meet with the ENL team who meet 
together in one room. We utilize a CBO 
partnership and Guidelines, a private 
translation vendor to assist with 
interpretation and translation. 

For each parent teacher conference, we 
compile a schedule of translators that go 
throughout the building to assist 
teachers in their conferences. We utilize 
a CBO partnership, a private translation 
vendor, and pay para 
professionals/school aides per-session. 
In addition, we get volunteers to assist in 
translations. 

During parent engagement workshops 
we utilize our staff that can speak 
Mandarin, Spanish and other languages 
for oral translations. Additionally we 
have Guidelines, a private translation 
vendor at the school during parent 
engagement time each Tuesday.  

Administration and parent coordinator 
regularly assess the language needs for 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

   

 

parents and ensure translations through 
a school aide or other staff member. 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency we have several mandarin speaking staff members on the BRT team. They would 
then be able to reach out to parents through the Remind online application or communicate with them via phone. 
Our BRT team leader can also speak Mandarin and we have several other languages represented on the BRT team if 
needed. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

The first day that staff is back in September, Chancellors regulations are discussed. It is important to the culture of our 
school that parents feel supported in their home language. As such we look for additional staff that can speak a 
language important to our families and utilize our CBO partnerships when needed. The parent coordinator and other 
key school-based staff is always readily available to provide information to the staff about language access 
requirements. It is expected that staff members will adhere to the goals of this regulation and the administration will 
ensure that is the case. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At the beginning of each school year, parents/guardians are given a copy of the Parents’ Bill of Rights and 
Responsibilities. All parents get an English copy, all Chinese parents are given a Chinese copy, and separate translated 
copies are provided for the small number of families who do not speak Chinese. The contents of this document are 
reviewed and discussed at Back to School night, which our school holds on the September conference date. Chinese 
signs notifying parents of the availability of staff translators are posted at the front door, by the security desk, and in 
the main office. In addition, copies of the Language ID guide are maintained at the security desk and in the main 
office, to identify the language needs of non-Chinese speakers. Finally, bilingual signs posted at the security desk 
instruct visitors how to sign in and proceed to the office, where translators are available.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 
 

Our parent coordinator hosts an ELL parent panel at least 4 times a year, where parents of ELL students can voice 
their concerns and issues can be discussed to bring to the principal for consultation. This will allow parents to not only 
give feedback on our ENL curriculum, but also to discuss the efficacy of our school’s translation and interpretation 
services. We will also gather data on parent opinion of our T&I services via the first page of the Parent Survey and 
Selection Form, as well as from responses to our annual school survey.  

Parents can also provide feedback at any time through the Remind and Class Dojo online resource. Parents are 
provided with information on how to set up an account when they register and then again during the first week of 
school. These online applications are a way for staff members to communicate with parents about any questions, 
concerns or other feedback in regards to language services. The online application is designed to translate messages 
into a variety of languages. Parents can provide feedback in their own language and it will be translated back to 
English for the school.  

Additionally, on back to school night, Tuesday's parent engagement time and during parent teacher conferences, our 
school will have a translation vendor called Guidelines who will provide translators for a variety of languages. At this 
time, parents can provide any feedback on their child's language progress and language services.  

In addition, the ENL team holds a meeting twice a month to discuss language service needs. The team then works 
collaboratively using parental feedback to improve language services.
