Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of Concord High School is to develop the leaders of tomorrow by preparing all students to meet the high 
academic, technical, civic and workforce challenges of the twenty-first century. We believe that strong leadership 
throughout our united community of faculty members, students, parents and associates will move us toward our 
goals. We, therefore, hold in the highest regard the initiative, planning, effort and teamwork that result in academic 
rigor, in standard setting student performance and in continuous improvement. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Concord High School is the only New York City Department of Education transfer high school on Staten Island. We 
work closely with all of the high schools on Staten Island to identify students that would benefit from the special 
atmosphere and approach of Concord. 

 

Concord High School provides a warm and welcoming school environment for all students. The environment is one in 
which every staff member knows every student in the school. Concord also has a “Student Adoption” program where 
every student is “adopted” by a staff member. That staff member becomes the student’s point of contact for 
questions, report cards, and guidance. This has played a key role in the increase in credit accumulation and 
attendance at Concord. 

 

Concord High School fosters relationships with outside partners to help its students succeed. Students receive 
educational support through partnerships with THE New York Center for Interpersonal Development (NYCID), Wagner 
College, College of Staten Island, YMCA, JCC, Sundog Theatre, Council on the Arts and Humanities for Staten Island, 
Women's Theatre Project, Ramapo for Children, Generation Citizen, Read Alliance, and Generation Ready. Our 
students also receive social/emotional support from our partnerships with Camelot Peer-Mediation, Department of 
Mental Health, and the ADL (Anti-Defamation League) Peer Educators. Concord students work to give back to the 
community through its partnerships with Project Hospitality, GrowNYC, Move this World, and the American Cancer 
Society. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Students with Special Needs: 28% 

English Language Learners: 1% 

Overage/Undercredited: 75% 

These students are supported through differentiation, scaffolding, and SWD and/or ENL certified teachers. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

During the 2017-2018 school year Concord received a Quality Review where the school was rated "Proficient" in all 
areas with the exception of 1.2 and 5.1 which were rated "Developing".. This review highlighted Component 1.3, 
Leveraging Resources, as Concord's Area of Celebration. The evidence provided to support this finding was centered 
around hiring and programming decisions that were made to increase student access to the content and to 
strengthen teacher collaboration. To continue to build on this progress, collaborative work amongst teachers will 
continue to be one of Concord's main areas of focus. The review found Component 5.1, Monitoring and Revising 
Systems, as the Area of Focus. The evidence provided to support this finding was centered around the need to review 
instructional practices related to the school’s instructional core to better support all staff members to make needed 
adjustments and increase the consistency of practices across all departments. This will be addressed through an 
increased professional development focus on student questioning and discussion (3b), student engagement (3c), and 
assessment (3d). 

 

In the upcoming school year we will be continuing to build on our 2017-2018 school year instructional focus as we 
saw substantial growth in both our students and staff. Concord High School’s instructional focus and teacher team 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

focus will be on increasing student engagement and 21st century preparedness through an increased focus on 
infusing technology throughout all content areas. We will also focus on refining our STEM/computer technology 
programs, increase AP offerings, and incorporate College Access for All initiatives to aid our students’ college and 
career readiness. Through increased engagement we will increase students’ credit accumulation and transitional 
readiness. Our teachers will take part in extensive professional learning activities that will lead to increased student 
success in their courses through the increase in student engagement.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths: 

  According to staff and School Leadership Team review: 

o  High standards are set and clearly explained to students at the beginning of each term. These 
expectations are continually restated by the faculty and conveyed in all feedback to students. 

o  Students are best served through the utilization of double period classes for students taking specific 

Regent Exams or requiring remediation. 

o  Tailor made student programs to help the student be successful (start time, period placement, double 

periods, etc.) 

o  Science classrooms with built in lab desks in addition to regular classroom desks allowing for quick 

experiments within the class period. 

o  All classrooms have laptop computers to increase student engagement and allow for quick research 

within classes. The laptops allow for more variety in class activities, increasing differentiation, 
engagement, and rigor. 
Instruction is customized to the needs of each individual student within the classroom. 

o 

 

  According to 2017-2018 Quality Review: 

o  Additional Findings: (1.1)  

 

 

 

Findings: The curricula are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and/or content 
standards, integrate the instructional shifts, and consistently reflect rigorous habits in unit 
plans. 
Impact: Content-based tasks emphasize higher-order thinking for all students and promote 
college and career readiness. 
Supporting Evidence: 

  Curricular documents are aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and 

content standards and build coherence across and within grades.  

  The school leaders share in the belief that access to the material needs to be planned, 

differentiated, and reviewed. All units are teacher created and intended to focus on 
the needs of all learners including students with disabilities and English Language 
Learners (ELLs). 

  Curriculum maps provide evidence that the school develops rigorous academic tasks 

through the adaptation of instructional materials and adaptations for ELLs and 
students with disabilities.

o  Additional Findings: (2.2)  

 

 

 

Findings: Teachers use and create assessments and rubrics that are aligned to the school’s 
curricula. Common assessments are used to determine student progress towards goals across 
grades and subject areas. 
Impact: Students receive actionable feedback on their work from teachers and are able to use 
the information to improve their work products. The results from end-of-unit assessments are 
used to adjust curricula and instructional techniques. 
Supporting Evidence: 

  Assessments are aligned to the Common Core and content standards in the 

curriculum and include end-of-unit assessments, mock Regents examinations, and 
teacher created tests. In addition, teachers analyze student formative assessment 
data from quizzes and student work products to reveal information about student 
achievement.  

  According to 2017-2018 PPO Feedback: 

o  Area of Celebration: (1.3) Make strategic organizational decisions to support the school's instructional 

goals and meet student learning needs as evidenced by meaningful student work products. Your 
school's work on developing lessons that are aligned with Common Core Standards and are 
Academically Rigorous is evidence of a fully integrated approach to meeting the needs of your 
learners. 

 

 

 

 

Needs: 

 
 

Increased focus on student engagement through the infusion of technology. 
Increase in teacher practice alignment to the Danielson Framework for Teaching.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths:  

  According to staff and School Leadership Team review: 

o  Teacher Teams focused around both student improvement and subject specific instructional 

improvement. 

o  Diverse Professional Learning team that identifies areas of learning need for the staff. 
o  School schedule that allows for collaborative time. 
o  Weekly meetings (School Implementation Team, Attendance Team, etc.) to discuss and address issues 

in the school. 

o  An instructional focus identified and supported by the staff. 

 

  According to 2017-2018 Quality Review: 

o  Additional Finding: 

 

 

 

Findings: Teachers engage in inquiry-based professional collaboration that promotes 
distributed leadership and adjustments to teaching practices. 
Impact: Professional collaborations strengthen pedagogy and contribute to effective 
instructional practices in the classroom, and they provide opportunities for teachers to 
assume leadership roles in curriculum planning and development. 
Supporting Evidence: 

  All of the school’s thirteen teachers are engaged in one of the five teacher teams 

(ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies and Physical Education). Teachers collaborate on 
professional teams to discuss schoolwide instructional practices that support the 
implementation of the Common Core and the instructional shifts. Teacher teams 
meet to review curricula, work products, and student data to elevate the instructional 
capacity of teachers and align teacher practice to the school’s goals and the Common 
Core. Student work products reviewed during the teacher team observation meeting 
showed that students were incorporating content area vocabulary words, throughout 
their essays.  

  During the meeting with teachers, they shared that working with their colleagues has 

contributed to enhancing their teaching practice. Teachers shared that they learn 
from teachers beyond their grade and content area and indicated that as a result of 
the collaborative team time, intervisitations have been scheduled with a focus on 
observing best practices and receiving constructive feedback from colleagues. 
Teachers expressed feeling valued, and gave examples of key decisions that helped 
with changes to the school schedule, revising the structure of the teacher team 
meetings, and having input on curricular purchases.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24 

  The principal supports distributive leadership initiatives by creating a lead teacher 
role to support colleague teachers by working with them to improve. The sessions 
focus on curriculum, assessment and the refinement of student engagement and are 
facilitated by the lead teacher. During the teacher team interview, teachers shared 
that collaborative team meetings undergird professional development sessions that 
are spearheaded by teachers. For example, based on a fellow colleague sharing at a 
teacher team meeting, teachers engaged in honing their skills with the incorporation 
of Google classroom. Teachers reported that the collaborative planning meetings 
strengthen their instructional capacity, and one teacher shared that collaborating 
with peers has helped to improve her day-to-day planning.  

  According to 2017-2018 PPO Feedback: 

o  Area of Note: There is a school wide writing strategy called RACE. In the walk through I reviewed the 

student writing on the bulletin boards and it was evident that all content areas, including Physical 
Education and Health, are engaged in this work. 

 

 

 

 

Needs:  

 

Staff identified a need for increased subject specific professional learning. They expressed a desire for 
additional time built into the day to allow them to meet in subject discipline teams to learn from one another 
and share best practices. 

 

 

 

Priority Need: 

 

Staff identified a need for increased assistance in finding and implementing new technology to increase 
student engagement and strengthen instruction. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths:  

  According to staff and School Leadership Team review: 

o  Teachers state that school leadership makes clear to the staff his or her expectations for meeting 

instructional goals. 

o  Parents state school leadership is strongly committed to shared decision making. 
o  Teachers state that school leadership communicates a clear vision for this school. 
o  Teachers state that school leadership carefully tracks student academic progress. 
o  Teachers state that school leadership has made curriculum, instruction, and learning materials 

coordinated across the different grade levels at this school. 

o  Teachers state that school leadership has made certain that there is consistency in curriculum, 

instruction, and learning materials among teachers in the same grade level at this school. 

  According to 2017-2018 Quality Review: 

o  Area of Celebration: (1.3)  

 

 

 

Findings: The principal uses school resources and teacher time strategically to improve 
instruction, in order to meet the school’s instructional goals and improve the quality of 
student work.  
Impact: Effective use of resources and time ensures students’ access to meaningful learning 
opportunities, college and career readiness, and leads to stronger work products.  
Supporting Evidence: 

  The principal made deliberate decisions on the investment of the school’s budget, in 

alignment to instructional goals, the instructional foci and based on the Citywide 
Instructional Expectations (CIE). Technology equipment such as desktop and laptop 
computers were installed in classrooms, to give students additional access to online 
resources. Additional informational text materials have been purchased to support 
the instructional shifts, contributing to improvement in student performance, as 
evidenced by reviews of student work products.  

  To promote college readiness, hiring practices were reconsidered to leverage 

resources. This year, a committee of personnel use a tiered approach to interview 
and then make recommendations for the hire of new staff. Due to an influx of 
students with disabilities, there was a focus on hiring content specialists who are 
dually licensed in special education. These staff members were assigned to self-
contained or Integrated Co-teaching classes based on their content specialty.  
  The principal utilizes the school’s master schedule to provide all teachers with 

common planning time, in order for teachers to meet to discuss student work and 
effective grouping practices, as well as engage in ongoing professional development 
activities. School leaders also schedule one-to-one teacher conferences with teachers

to discuss common grade assessments and student progress. Teacher teams are 
responsible for discussing school goals, student outcomes, and instructional practices 
in order to accelerate student learning. This enables teachers to have dedicated time 
to focus on the impact of classroom practices on student outcomes, thereby elevating 
the quality of instruction, with emphasis on challenging tasks for students in all 
classrooms and content areas. 

  According to 2017-2018 PPO Feedback: 

o  Area of Celebration: 5.1 Evaluate the quality of school-level decisions, making adjustments as needed 
to increase the coherence of policies and practices across the school, with particular attention to the 
CCLS. 

o  Area of Note: I commend you on on the work you are doing to lead and grow your school community. 

  According to 2016-2017 PPO Feedback: 

o  At Concord High School, the principal has maximized the resources available for both students and 

staff by securing a 21st Century grant providing $120,000 per year for the next 5 year period.  

o  This will provide after school classes, college and career training including industry-based 

collaborations such as welding, cosmetology and Medical Billing and Coding.  

o  Kinvolved attendance outreach program/app has improved student attendance by 4% and improved 

communications among the school, students and families.  

o  The principal has also secured a NY State Senator Savino project Boost grant of $24,500 to implement 

a program to improve experiential learning for disengaged youth.  

o  Your school's work on developing lessons that are aligned with Common Core Standards and are 

Academically Rigorous is evidence of a fully integrated approach to meeting the needs of your 
learners. 

o  A strong element of this school and its leader can be seen in the school’s learning environment which 

is safe, welcoming and supportive. 

o  Your work in linking both Danielson's expectations, rubric specifics, and prior observational findings to 

each lesson observation provides clarity for teachers around improvement while promoting 
connectivity to both your and our district's focus on 'Follow Through."

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Concord High School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Concord High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

  Providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math, and use of technology; 

  Providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
Fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  Providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

Sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand; 

  Providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and 
other members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

  The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 

parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. 
The school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent 
involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the 
evaluation through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively 
meet the needs of parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by 
the school.  
In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members 
of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School 
Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their 
members for additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school 
will: 

o  Actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the 

 

school’s Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the 
implementation of the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

o  Engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are 

allocated directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and

Team, the Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This 
includes providing technical support and ongoing professional development, especially in developing 
leadership skills;  

o  Maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school 

and families. The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based 
on the assessed needs of the parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that 
the school environment is welcoming and inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also 
maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents each month and file a report with the 
central office.; 

o  Conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational 
accountability, grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community 
and support services; and technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at 
home;  

o  Provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, 
Quality Review Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

o  Host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to 

advise parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded 
program(s), their right to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under 
Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable sections under the ESSA; 

o  Schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in 

the morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other 
initiatives of the Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions; 

o  Translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as 

needed;  

o  Conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal 

presentations and workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can 
do to help. 

 

  The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

o  Holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
- Read 180 assessment test  
- NYC DOE Perfrormance Assessments  
- Teacher made Local assessments  
 
We use the data from the test results to adjust student schedules, groupings, and assure that students have access to the 
curriculum. Student supports are individualized as needed

We meet with each student and family to review assessment outcomes and progress and work together to formulate a plan. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Concord High School provides all eligible ELL students support through a freestanding ENL program, where students 
receive all instruction in English, emphasizing English Language acquisition. We use a self-contained ENL instructional 
model. 
  
Students in Beginning (B) ENL classes receive 3 periods per day of ENL instruction. 
Students in Intermediate (I) ENL classes receive 2 periods per day of ENL instruction. 
Students in Advanced (A) ENL classes receive 1 period per day of ENL instruction. The Advanced  
(A) ENL students also receive 1 period per day of English language arts instruction.  
  
Students are grouped homogeneously based on proficiency levels rather than by grade as our school does not follow 
a strict grade level model.  
 
All ENL and ELA instruction includes literature and content-based instruction which is aligned explicitly to Common 
Core State Standards. Explicit ENL instruction is delivered in the following ways:  
• Teachers scaffold academic language and complex content to support student participation in content areas  
• Language functions and structures are taught within the context of the lesson.  
• Teachers use a wide range of visuals and print materials to develop English language proficiency  
• Teachers model the use of the language in ways in which the students are expected to participate.  
• Teachers use stories that are based on the students’ culture that will connect to the students’ prior experiences.

below)? 

Students in Beginning (B) ENL classes receive 3 periods per day of ESL instruction. 
Students in Intermediate (I) ENL classes receive 2 periods per day of ENL instruction. 
Students in Advanced (A) ENL classes receive 1 period per day of ENL instruction. The Advanced (A) ENL students also receive 1 
period per day of English language arts instruction.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The Beginning ENL course focuses on the following: BICS (conversation, social, and survival skills), phonological, morphological, 
syntax, collocation or word banks, front loading, and total physical response. Listening and reading is more heavily weighted in 
instruction with some writing and speaking in each lesson plan.  
  
The Intermediate and Advanced course focuses on CALPS (cognitive, academic language proficiency), graphic organizers, 
research skills, and multiple-choice test taking skills, cloze activities, metacognition skills, inferences, whole language, and 
grammar. Listening, reading, writing, and speaking are the four components of an ENL lesson.  
  
All ENL and ELA instruction includes literature and content-based instruction which is aligned explicitly to the Common Core 
State Standards. Explicit ENL instruction is delivered in the following ways:  
• Teachers scaffold academic language and complex content to support student participation in content areas  
• Language functions and structures are taught within the context of the lesson.  
• Teachers use a wide range of visuals and print materials to develop English language proficiency  
• Teachers model the use of the language in ways in which the students are expected to participate.  
• Teachers use stories that are based on the students’ culture that will connect to the students’ prior experiences.  
Content Area Instruction  
  
All content area courses are taught in English using ENL and ELA methodologies and are aligned with the Common Core 
Standards in each content area. Courses offer challenging content and are taught using instructional strategies that will 
prepare students to think critically, solve problems, and acquire the language and skills needed to meet the NYS and NYC 
standards. Our certified ENL teacher works collaboratively with the content area teachers, provide indirect support for the ELL 
population. ELL’s are provided with native language glossaries to support content area instruction. Our ESL teacher works 
individually with each student to support content area instruction  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Our certified ENL teacher works collaboratively with the content area teachers, to provide support for the ELL population. ELL’s 
are provided with native language glossaries to support content area instruction and assessments and evaluations are 
translated to the student's prefered language when needed.

Support for Newcomers (ELLs in US schools less than three years). - At the core of our ENL philosophy is to offer a 
comfortable environment so students will become quickly immersed in their schooling and feel encouraged to practice their 
English language skills with one another and our native speaking population. It is also important to provide exposure to 
American culture. All new ELLs administered the Lab-R. Results of the Lab-R will help determine appropriate services for the 
student. Parents will be provided with the same ESL information that was stated above, and will be given the option of 
choosing the most appropriate program for their child. All new students participate in our Ambassador Program. This program 
matches each new student with a current student who will serve as a mentor. The Ambassadors help the new student 
acclimate to the school environment and culture.  
  
Support for Students with Interrupted Formal Education(SIFE) - All ENL classes offer cooperative group work activities, visual 
aids, multi-intelligence activities, workshop model, balanced literacy. SIFE students are provided with opportunities to attend 
tutoring sessions to provide targeting interventions as determined through ongoing assessment.  
  
Concord High school offers a smaller learning environment than the traditional high school setting. Our school culture and 
learning environment gives use the opportunity and flexibility to differentiate intruction for all of our ELL students, whether 
that . The learning and social emotional needs of our students are met on an individual level, whether that student is a new 
ELL, 4 to 6 years ELL, or LTE.

test modification for two years.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At this time Concord High School has no special education ELL students. However, all support and instructional programs 
available for ELL students and Special Needs students are available for students identified as both ELL and Special Needs. The 
guidance counselor will review the records of all ELL-SWD's to make sure they receive all services mandated on their IEP, as 
well as spending the maximum amount of time spent with non-disabled peers.  
  
All instruction for ELL-SWD includes literature and content-based instruction which is aligned explicitly to Common Core 
State Standards. Explicit ENL instruction is delivered in the following ways:

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Concord High School is dedicated to using a comprehensive approach to provide services for our ELL population from the very 
beginning stages of language acquisition to English language proficiency. Many students who have been turned away from large 
high schools because of their age and level of English skills, find a home at Concord who help them acquire language skills and 
credit accumulation in a safe, friendly, and academic rigorous curricula. Through early identification of students, collaborative 
planning and preparation, guidance support services, content area courses infused with ENL and ELA methodologies and 
professional development for our staff, we are working on assisting all students in completing their high school diploma 
requirements.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christopher Anzalone, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Concord High school identifies the primary language spoken by the parent of each student through personal 
interviews upon enrollment. A Home Language report (RHLA) and Prefered Language report (RAPL) is run is ATS to 
identify any information that may not have been captured at interview. This information is kept on file,maintained 
in ATS and recorded on the child’s emergency contact card.  

We have translated many of our school letters into Spanish. The Translation and Interpretation unit will assist us 
in translating any additional information as needed.
