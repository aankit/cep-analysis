Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 91’s mission statement: 

 

The mission of P.S. 91Q is to ensure that all students will be college and career ready as they move on to the next 
phase of education, by individualizing instruction to meet the needs and styles of each student in accordance with the 
Common Core. School-wide analysis of data through collaborative inquiry team work will help us to fully understand 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

the areas of support needed for every child. This will foster an environment where our diverse population of students, 
as well as the students with special needs, and limited English proficient students will be educated equitably. We 
utilize various methodologies to encourage student-led inquiry amongst one another, which will support critical 
thinking and decision making skills. Through the incorporation of our PBIS (P.A.W.S.)program, we address and support 
the social emotional learning of all students. In addition, we will continue to use staff developments to enhance and 
grow within our instructional practices, as well as frequent observations and feedback cycles supported by “The 
Danielson Framework for Teaching” to ensure the effectiveness of instruction. We will continue to include parents in 
the education of their children by expanding parent workshops and encouraging parental involvement at every turn 
to support and reinforce the learning process. 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The Richard Arkwright School (P.S. 91Q) is located at 68-10 Central Avenue Glendale, New York 11385.  

 

The school serves a diverse population of approximately 780 students ranging from Kindergarten to Fifth grade,  

 

while additionally housing approximately 85 Pre-Kindergarten students in conjunction with the Universal Pre-K 
initiative.  

 

P.S. 91Q sits in an ever changing neighborhood, home to many new immigrant families from around the world. The 
school has  

 

been part of the community, and has provided an education for generations Glendale children since 1914. A new  

 

addition was erected to the original school structure in the 1990's and was especially designed to meet  

 

the needs of early childhood learners. In addition, it is barrier free and can accommodate the physically  

 

challenged. P.S. 91's physical environment and appearance is well kept and serves as a place where pride in our 
students’  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

accomplishments is evident in the prominently displayed student work. 

 

PS 91 works in partnership with many organizations ranging from instructional programs, arts and music, as well as 
extra  

 

curricular activities.  

 

Beginning the 2018-2019 school year, we will be partnering with the Teachers College Reading and Writing Project to 
foster young 

 

learners in becoming skilled readers and writers. Through professional learning sessions, teachers will obtain tools 
and methods  

 

for teaching reading and writing to meet the educational goals of our students. We will also be working closely with 
Sanford  

 

Harmony, focusing on the social emotional well-being of all children through communication, embracing diversity, 
and resolving  

 

conflict among students in the classroom.  

 

P.S. 91 has built a lasting relationship with Arts Connections which exposes students to a variety of art forms such as 
theatre, and movement activities.  

 

One of the art disciplines that they support our students with is puppetry for the lower grades. This year Arts 
Connection will expand to include a dance program for K, 1, and 2  

 

In addition, our fifth grade students participate in Dancing Classrooms which helps to build  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

essential life skills through the art of social dance.  

 

PS 91 has applied for an Arts and Family Engagement grant sponsored by the New York City Office of Arts and Special 
Projects.  

 

This Arts partnership initiative is a product of Chancellor Farina's vision to not only expand arts opportunities for NYC 
school  

 

students, but to also boost parent, family and community engagement around all aspects of our students' education. 
This  

 

program will showcase students' school-based, Blueprint aligned arts experiences. It will also illuminate connections 
between  

 

student art and other academic learning. Students, parents, and family will be engaged in art making learning 
activities and  

 

demonstrate the power and importance of the arts in a school setting. 

 

Furthermore, PS 91 will partner with St Francis Preparatory High School's orchestra program to develop skills for 
young musicians  

 

in string and woodwind instruments.  

 

In addition, PS 91 will be partnering with The ASD Horizon program, which is a differentiated special education 
program in  

 

community schools that serves individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This program is designed to strengthen 
academic  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12 

 

and social skills by delivering an inclusive model fostering an integrated environment.  

 

P.S. 91 will continue its strong partnership with the Greater Ridgewood Youth Council (GRYC). They assist 

 

our students with homework as well as creating an environment for building positive relationships with other children 
in the  

 

school, focusing on building character and creating good citizens. The program runs Monday through Friday for 3 
hours each day.  

 

In conjunction with The NYC DOE Adaptive Physical Education program, PS 91 will also take part in the expansion of 
the CHAMPS  

 

(Cooperative, Healthy, Active, Motivated, and Positive Students)  

 

Sports and Fitness initiative. This program will promote student physical activity during the critical years of

We are also in partnership with the Intrepid Air, Sea and Space Museum to enrich our students in the academic areas 

 

of Science, Math, Social Studies and Technology. Students are instructed in historical events, analyzing artifacts, 

 

 and participating in science experimentation. Family participation is an integral part of the program's success.

Our Students with Disabilities population is struggling with moving back to an ICT or Gen. Ed. setting. They are 
becoming complacent within the small class setting, need to be challenged in order to re-integrate within a less 
restrictive classroom setting. Conversations with the parents need to be had, and meetings consistent so that the 
collective goal of the school is to track how long they've been in this particular setting, and what has to happen so 
that they are consistently being met with rigorous learning opportunities, and setting goals for themselves toward 
mainstreaming. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Strengths: According to the Framework For Great Schools 2016 Report, PS 91 boasts high positive responses for 
collaborative teachers. The schedule created sets the tone for the school by building into the week at least 2 common 
preparation periods that grade level teams can share. This is time allotted so that purposeful planning, and sharing of 
best practices can effectively take place. In addition, one Monday afternoon time is there per month for the teachers 
to work in collaborative inquiry teams to analyze data and inform future instruction. The teachers have subgroups of 
students in which they will track and progress monitor the growth of throughout the duration of the year. The 
administration has fostered classroom inter-visitation work to increase school wide coherence across the grades in 
regards to teacher practices. A "Glass Walls" initiative has begun at 91 which allows the teachers to engage in, and 
reflect upon one another's teaching practices. 

P.S. 91 has also made significant strides toward increasing the strong family-community ties within the school as 
evidenced by the movement from 2015-2016 parent survey response percentage which was 43% to the 2016-2017 
percentage of 55%. This increase can be attributed to the dissemination of information in a more timely, and 
systematic manner. The information went home in the language of the parents and therefore increased 
communication between the school and the community. 

 

P.S. 91, in partnership with TLIM Program is well on its way to improving upon the level of shared leadership within 
the building by gradually releasing responsibility within the classrooms, creating shared approaches to instruction, 
and including the parents in learning process of their students. Additionally, an established level of trust exists at 91 
and is evident in our score being higher than the district and citywide average on the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide. 

 

 

Area of Focus: 

An area of focus for this coming school year will be around rigorous instruction. With the creation of the Professional 
Learning Team specifically targeted learning will be built to meet the direct needs of the teachers. We will focus our 
efforts on how to increase the levels of student engagement, autonomy, and ownership by offering trainings for the 
staff on lesson creation, differentiation, data analysis, questions and discussions, and embedding assessment within 
instruction. The teachers will increase their small group learning opportunities within the day, and with the addition 
of Teacher's College Writing in to our curriculum the teachers will be able to conference with the students more 
frequently, and begin to identify their specific needs, and create learning for them that is meant to meet them at their 
multiple entry points.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
As per the 2017-2018 PPO and Quality Review reports, a strength is that PS 91 has a strategic and transparent system 
for providing staff with meaningful professional development around meeting the academic needs of all learners.  

A priority around professional development would be to build sustainability and capacity through distributive 
leadership practices around the key areas of higher levels of engagement through differentiation strategies. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will continue to refine teaching strategies and lesson activities through focused 
professional development around rigorous task creation, student choice, assessment and feedback, questions and 
discussions, and flexible grouping as per the 2017-2018 PPO areas of focus.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the 
activities and strategies your school will 
implement to achieve the identified goal 
for this Framework for Great Schools 
element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional 

 

programs, professional 
development, and/or systems and 
structures needed to impact 
change. 
Strategies to address the needs of 
students with disabilities, English 
language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., 
overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

Teachers will utilize Common Planning time 
to ensure cohesion across the grades, as 
well as alignment to the Common Core. 
They will upload their curriculum units to 
Google Docs for sharing, and task creation 
to meet the varying needs of ALL students, 
and will be available for perusal by ALL 
teachers. 

-Teachers use quality rubrics aligned to the 
Common Core to grade the work and 
provide the students with next steps. The 
rubrics are used within instruction for self 
or peer assessment as well. 

-We will incorporate The TC 
Reading/Writing Project, and continue 
working with Go Math and it's resources to 
plan rigorous academic tasks. These tasks 
will be refined through the collaborative 
analysis of student outcomes during inquiry 
work, so that every child has access to the 
learning and is cognitively engaged. 

-Support staff, including related service 
providers push-in to support the learning 
and foster student to student discourse. 

-Administrators create a schedule allowing 
for three common planning meetings as 
well as weekly meetings to analyze student 
work samples, share best practices, and

discuss ways to increase levels of student 
engagement (Inquiry Teams). 

-Professional Learning Plan informed by 
classroom observations and teacher surveys 
in conjunction with the Field Support 
Center.  

-Two teacher lead facilitators have been 
identified to pilot the SPLP work focused 
around increased levels of engagement 
through rigor, student choice, flexible 
grouping, questions and discussions, and 
assessment and feedback.  

-Through the use of Douglas Fisher and 
Nancy Frey’s, Rigorous Reading, 5 Access 
Points for Comprehending Complex Texts, 
we will provide a targeted focus around 
instructional improvement and meet the 
needs of every child while simultaneously 
increasing student autonomy and 
ownership. 

-"Glass Walls" demonstration lab sites 
focused on Socratic Seminars will help to 
foster a community focused on students 
being able to build off of one anothers 
knowledge, and will help to increase levels 
of student ownership over their own 
learning.

To continue to build a school culture based 
on trust, collaboration and respect, school 
leaders have an open door policy that 
involves all stakeholders. By creating these 
strong partnerships between the families, 
the school, and the community, we are 
increasing the level of learning, as well as 
the students’ drive for education. In 
addition, we are increasing the level of trust 
among the staff members by fostering “The 
91 We Teach, We Learn Initiative.” This is a 
“Glass Walls” type of learning where the 
staff members take turns opening up their 
classrooms for visits from other staff 
members to increase transparency, 
coherence, and ultimately help to improve

State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Through specifically targeted, curriculum based parent engagement workshops, as well as Parent Square, Tuesday 
afternoon meetings, and content specific parent cohorts, we will be able to support the parents' understanding of 
what rigorous instruction looks and sounds like within the classrooms, and across the grades. Four parent workshops 
presented by ENL teachers in the school throughout the course of the year to increase parent awareness around 
student achievement. Parent Cohorts are facilitated bi-monthly and parents are offered opportunities to observe 
learning within the classrooms in action. Teachers are present and available during PTA meetings.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strength: Based on the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, 96% of teachers say that adults at the school help students 
develop the skills they need to complete challenging coursework despite obstacles.  

A priority would be for teachers to recognize disruptive behaviors as social-emotional learning opportunities and 
incorporate the newly embedded PBIS structures to support ALL students.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, in an attempt to teach to the whole child, we will increase social-emotional awareness by 10% as 
evidenced by the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide through the incorporation of Sanford Harmony (SEL curriculum),

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

After an analysis of the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, we have identified the strengths and needs of our school 
pertaining to 

professional development within our school as well as opportunities with other professionals in the district. 

 

Strengths: According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, 95% of teachers say that they have had opportunities to 
work productively with colleagues within the school during professional development. Additionally, 96% of teachers 
stated that they had adequate time following the professional learning sessions to think carefully, implement, and 
then evaluate new ideas.  

 

Needs: A priority is to afford teachers opportunities to work with professionals from other schools within the district 
to focus on obtaining new teaching tools and techniques that can be implemented into our own classrooms at PS 91.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, the School Quality Guide will indicate an increase of 20%, moving from 59% to 79%, providing evidence 
that most teachers will have been afforded opportunities to work productively with pedagogues from other schools on 
professional development. This will be achieved through the Sustainable Professional Learning Pilot which will involve a 
collaboration between the Borough Field Support Office and schools in neighboring districts.

support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: A strength at PS 91 is that it is clear how all of the programs offered are connected to the schools 
instructional vision and therefore provide the foundation for which the instructional focus is based.  

An area of need for PS 91 is to maintain consistency with curriculum. In the past, curriculum programs were adopted 
and changed soon after, hence cross-curricular and grade coherence was not evident.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be an increase from 87% to 100% of teachers who indicate the improvement of cross-curricular 
coherence as evidenced by the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide. PS 91 will achieve this through the incorporation of 
grade specific vertical teams in which teachers will be provided opportunities to gain a deeper understanding of the 
curriculum, instructional practices, and learning materials used across the grades.

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Based on analysis of the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, it is apparent that PS 91 demonstrates strong ties amongst 
families and community based organizations within the Glendale community.  

Strengths: PS 91 exhibits multiple strengths pertaining to communication with students families. Families feel that 
they are greeted warmly upon entering the building and state that teachers work closely with them, are well 
informed, and that staff communicate regularly about how they can help their child learn. 

Needs: Our priority at PS 91 is to work closely with our families and to provide more opportunities for families to visit 
their child's classroom. It is imperative that parents are part of our school community and are able to visit classrooms 
to observe instruction and participate in school activities.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, 100% of parents will have the opportunity to visit their child's classroom by participating in scheduled 
parent cohorts that will focus on specific areas of instruction throughout the school year. This goal represents an 11% 
increase as evidenced by the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

 

-Parent cohorts will be scheduled to provide parents with the 
opportunity to visit their child's class to observe instructional 
practices. Through these classroom visits, parents will be more 
informed about the curriculum, how it is implemented, and ways 
they can support their children at home.  

-Parent coordinator and Literacy Coach will plan parent 
workshops to keep parents informed and involved in school 
activities.  

Following the teachings of Karen Mapp and Anne Henderson’s, 
“Beyond the Bake Sale, The Essential Guide To Family School 
Partnerships” will help to support the journey for more 
meaningful parent learning opportunities. 

-Parent Coordinator takes part in City led/District wide trainings 
and turnkeys the information to the parents about new 
initiatives.

To continue to build on and support a school culture based on 
trust, teachers will provide parents with information regarding 
their student’s progress in a timely manner as per the NYC Parent 
Engagement Plan that has been established. They will have 
Tuesday afternoons to reach out to the families of their students 
so that PTC nights are not the only time families are learning how 
their children are doing. Student-Led conferences will be a focus, 
and thus by instilling in the students the ability to successfully 
articulate and communicate their successes and their next steps, 
communication will increase with families to a daily basis.

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Here at P.S. 91Q, in order to ensure that all staff members are highly qualified to interact with, instruct, and support 
all of our students, we have established a P.L. Team that is comprised of one teacher from each grade, one cluster 
teacher, and all out of classroom instructional personnel. This team works in conjunction with administration, and the 
FSC through the SPLP Pilot program to create a Professional Learning Plan that supports all of our teachers' 
professional learning goals.  

Through the analysis of Advance Data, and student achievement data, informed decisions are made regarding teacher 
placement in different grades. Candidates for newly created positions are vetted through an interview process, and 
demonstration lessons to ensure that they have the tools necessary to support our students. Many candidates are 
selected for the interview process based on their Open Market interest. 

 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Here at 91Q we believe in a collaborative approach to learning, and our mindset is that of constant growth and 
learning. Our P.L. team meets monthly to work on our P.L. Plan to ensure that teachers are receiving training in their 
specific areas of need. In conjunction with the FSC, we work to identify the best training available to support their 
growth and development throughout the school year.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
We transition our students from early childhood programs into elementary school programs by incorporating our 
early childhood educators within our Professional Learning Plans to ensure a seamless instructional environment once 
the children step up. Pre-K - 5 teachers are represented on our vertical team, and all learning is across the grades. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Here at 91Q we have a MOSL team in which each grade level is represented. We have a data specialist who works in 
conjunction with all teachers to ensure that they are knowledgeable about how to analyze data, and make informed 
instructional decisions around it. We work collaboratively to norm and align all assessment practices so that the data 
that we gather is cohesive. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Richard Arkwright School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The Richard Arkwright School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

Begin description here:            
  
Rationale:  
 
Title III provides English Language Learners with supplemental instruction in a before school 
program.  All Entering, Emerging and Transitional ELL students received invitation letters to the 
Title lll program.  The before school program  addresses instruction to improve literacy in the 
content areas.   The program will utilize the Imagine Learning English computer program or( 
ILE) and small group strategy lessons based on Data generated from areas of need from the 
NYSESLAT results, the ILE computer program individual assessment data results and writing 
strategy lessons. 
 
Imagine Learning English is an engaging language and literacy software program that accelerates 
English learning.  It is focused on oral language, academic vocabulary, instruction in the five 
essential components of reading, and strategic first-language support.  Kids learn through videos, 
pictures, glossaries and direct translations.  It provides explicit instruction in phonological 
awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension.  ILE also provides aid in listening 
comprehension through selective listening, verbal and non-verbal clues and specific words and 
phrases.  In addition to providing a vehicle for strengthening grammar skills.  It engages students 
to work on their oral fluency by listening, repeating and recording phrases into the program. 
The research based, standards aligned ILE program automatically adapts and differentiates to the 
needs of the individual English Language learner. 
 
This program in combination with grade level data based strategy lessons provided by the ENL 
instructors will help our ELLs to rapidly acquire the language needed to succeed. 
 
Subgroups and grade levels of students to be served: 
 
The instructional program will service ELLs in grades K-5 who score at the entering,emerging 
and transitional levels on the NYSESLAT. 
Teachers will provide supplemental instruction in alignment with the ESL and Common Core 
standards taking small groups of children in grades K & 1 , 2 & 3 and 4 & 5 respectively. We 
will use ESL strategies to help students meet the standards and through this, achieve higher 
scores on the NYSESLAT and other state assessments.    Entering and Emerging ELL's will be 
taught using ESL strategies to aid them in grasping the challenging vocabulary in the content 
areas.  Transitioning students will continue to be challenged by ever more rigorous materials to 
enhance their educational experience.  Instruction will concentrate on improving literacy in 
content areas. 
 
The class will consist of 25 minutes of direct instruction with Data driven strategy lessons given 
by our ENL and content area instructors followed by 20 minutes utilizing the Imagine Learning 
English computer program.  The ENL teacher will use special strategies to assist our ELLs in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
their language acquisition.  The ENL teacher will also assist the content area teachers with such 
strategies.  Strategy lessons will be grade and skill appropriate in all four modalities (speaking, 
listening, reading and writing). 
 
Schedule and duration: 
 
The before school morning program will be from October 2018 to June 2019. 
It will meet on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays for 45 minutes from 7:15 to 8:00AM. 
 
Language of Instruction: 
 
The language of instruction from the teachers will be in English.  However the ILE computer 
program does provide 1st language support for all students. 
 
# and Types of Certified Teachers: 
 
Three teachers will will work in this program.  One certified Bilingual Education teacher and two 
certified content area teachers.The Certified Bilingual Education teacher will be responsible for 
scaffolding instruction using ESL strategies to meet the need of our students enrolled in the 
program.  One common branch teacher is a reading intervention teacher who is expert on 
providing reading strategies for struggling learners. The other common branch teacher is a 
content area specialist. 
 
Types of Materials: 
 
The purchase of the Imagine Learning English licences are to address the needs of our ELL 
students.  They will only be used during the Title lll morning program.  These licenses will allow 
us to generate data driven teaching materials from the program to address such needs in literacy 
as phonemic and phonological awareness, decoding and word recognition, spelling, pre-reading 
strategies, fluency and oral reading skills, comprehension strategies and handwriting.   Students 
will also use materials from Getting Ready For The NYSESLAT differentiated by grade.

PS 91 translates all important parent notifications into various languages as needed by our multi-
ethnic school staff.  All translations are done in a timely fashion so that our parent community 
can be adequately informed.  At our Parent Information Center our Parent Coordinator provides 
parents with language translation via computers and pamphlets.  
Oral translations are provided via telephone or in person to assist our immigrant 
population.  Translations are performed by staff members with the option of being performed by 
an outside contractor if necessary. 
All workshops provided to parents will take place from October 2018 through June 2019.  They 
will be given by our Parent Coordinator, ELL Teachers and  Administration.  Our Parent 
Coordinator will provide translations to ELL parents as they are needed.  The school also 
provides translations by our multi-ethnic school staff.  All parents who have students in the Title 
lll and who have ELL students are invited to attend. We give these workshops because our ELL 
students tend to perform below standards on the NYS ELA and Math examinations.  By 
attending these workshops it is our hope that it will provide a better understanding of what is 
expected of their children to meet the standards.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The EDAT tool can be used to focus on the academic achievement of specific subgroups of students and to design effective 
instructional programs and/or interventions. The factors that can be analyzed include years of ELL service, NYSESLAT 
proficiency and progress, SIFE (Students with Interrupted Formal Education) status, home language, disability classification, 
attendance, age, credit accumulation, holdover status, grade level, ELA/math performance and progress, The Early Warning 
Indicator feature automatically calculates the number of risk factors exhibited and is color-coded to indicate students’ 
increased risk levels. The tool supports key stakeholders within school communities (superintendents, clusters, networks, 
school leaders, teachers, etc.) as they work to: • Identify the instructional and programmatic differences between specific 
subgroups • Design targeted, data-driven instructional programs to impact student learning • Document and share best 
practices across districts, clusters, networks, and schools • Highlight students who exhibit known risk factors in order to 
develop and implement targeted interventions.  After analyzing the data provided by the EDAT we have determined that in 
grades K-5, ELL students had a challenge performing at a high level on the Listening Modality.  Additional data indicates that 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

a  strong area of need in our school is in the Writing Modality.  The data shows that many children in grades 2-5 are 
performing at a low level with the largest need in grade 2.  Though many of our ENL students made progress moving up levels 
on the NYSESLAT 23 students remained at the same level.  The data indicates that they needed to improve their performance 
.  As a result of this data, PS 91 has adopted the Teachers College Writing Workshop with all of it's assessments to help our 
students become better writers.  P.S. 91 uses the Fountas and Pinnell running records in grades K-2 to assess our ELL 
students.  In grades 3-5 we use the Fountas and Pinnell running records along with the Baseline Math Assessments to assess 
our ELL students.  The data on the EDAT also indicated that their is a need for improvement in The Reading modality in grades 
2-5.   Many of our ELL's read one or two grades below their current reading level as measured by the Fountas and Pinnell 
running records.  The lower reading levels have been attributed to our large ELL special needs population along with the 
nature of ELL students picking up the new language.  In addition, P.S. 91 has adopted MYON Reading to help support student 
growth in ELA by providing each student with access to their own leveled libraries at home with which to work out of.   In 
addition, many of our ELL's receive AIS services to help them with their academic progress in the form of morning ENL program 
headed by a reading teacher and a bilingual specialist.  We also formed an RTI team this year to help identify students at risk 
early on and help to provide them with the necessary Tier 1 and Tier 2 interventions.  The teachers collaborate to create 
scaffolds in their instructional plans to help meet  the multiple entry points of all students. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

F & P running records are administered at set intervals throughout the year.  Then running records are analyzed and used to 
plan instruction.  The results of The Teachers College Writing Workshop writing pieces and Math unit assessments which are 
administered throughout the year are used to drive small group learning, and increase the individualized instruction being 
provided.  Reading, Math and Writing levels and needs are discussed at Professional Developments sessions on Monday 
afternoons, Data dives, and grade level conferences on a weekly basis.  A Data Specialist Role has been assigned this year and 
they are creating spreadsheets to track the impact of the work.  The teachers are working in structured Inquiry Teams and 
working through Inquiry Cycles that focus on our ENL Population as the main subgroup being studied.   Fountas and 
Pinnel reading levels are distributed electronically via Google Drive and shared so that there is cross grade coherence. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Success in our ENL program can be measured  by how well the students assimilate into an English speaking classroom.  In 
addition, student success is quantitatively  measured by Fountas and Pinnell reading levels, and both periodic and 
standardized assessments. Current data trends indicate that 88% of our 3, 4 and 5 students scored at a 1 level on the ELA and 
67% at a 1 Level on the State Math test.  In our analysis the students have a very challenging time understating the passages 
and word problems.  Our baseline writing assessments show our ENL writing far below grade level.  With the incorporation of 
Teacher's College Writing Workshop this year, we will use the On Demand writing pieces as baseline writing assessments to 
gauge students' entry levels to the work.  In addition, with the Instructional Focus for this school year revolving around how to 
increase conversations between students, questions and discussions will be used as formative tools for assessment. Our 
students benefit from the quality of instruction given to them.  Success in ENL is measured not only by data and standardized 
tests but by the smiles of the children as they acquire a new found language.   
  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Based on data the school creates instructional strategies to address interventions needed.  PS 91 uses sheltered English, 
scaffolding strategies, computer based learning to provide needed interventions for our ENL students to help them to achieve 
greater success. These interventions are implemented throughout the year as necessary. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 91 assesses our ELLs reading levels through Fontas and Pinell and writing through language structure analysis to determine 
ELL's needs (Christna Celic, " English Language Learners Day by Day K-6").  ELL students in need of RtI are afforded all 
opportunities to participate in morning, and after school Title III Programs.  Once data is gathered by the teachers they begin 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

to implement Tier 1 interventions within the classrooms.  The students are tracked throughout the course of a cycle  of 4-6 
weeks and then impact of the intervention is assessed and adjusted as per individual student needs. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Analysis of the NYSESLAT and ELA has indicated that ELL students have performed at the lowest levels in the reading and 
writing modalities.  The ELA exam indicated that out of 32 students in grades 3,4 and 5 who took it 88% scored a Level 1, and 
that 12% scored a level 2.   In regard to the state Math test 42 ELL students took it and 67% scored level 1, 21% scored level 2 
and 11% scored level 3.  An analysis of the Math State assessment and ELA shows that reading passages and word problems 
present a challenge in comprehension.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Based on analysis of the data PS 91 disseminates the findings to all staff during professional developments provided on 
Monday afternoons.  Data is also shared through Google Drive that is set up by Data Specialist.  All grades have two common 
prep periods a week in which key information is shared and acted upon.  In addition, this year ENL students are one of the 
main focused subgroups that the teachers are analyzing and tracking for growth and improvement. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1a.   ELL instruction at PS 91 is given in two ways.  We employ a combination of integrated and standalone 
programs.  Standalone programs are given to students who qualify for it based on the NYSESLAT score as per the CR 
Part 154.2 regulations.  ENL Instruction in standalone programs mirrors the grade level instruction of the classrooms 
that the ENL students came from.  They focus on scaffolding strategies to help them attain English proficiency.  The 
general education students are placed in ENL classes.  The special education students are placed in classes as per their 
IEP.  The integrated ENL students are serviced in blocks of 45 minutes as per the days’ schedule and the needs of the 
students.  Integrated instruction in classrooms is accomplished through the Teachers College Writing Workshop as 
well as the use of the Ready Gen reading curriculum.  The program model for ELL service is heterogeneous block.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A    

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Entering and Emerging students are given 1 unit of Stand-Alone ENL and 1 unit of Integrated ENL.  Transitioning and Expanding 
students receive 1 unit of Integrated ENL and Commanding students will receive .5 unit of Integrated ENL. Entering and 
emerging students receive 360 minutes of service per week.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 minutes of 
instruction per week.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of instruction per week. PS 91 ensures that the mandated 
number of instructional minutes of explicit instruction are given to all of our ELL students by full licensed ENL instructors in 
both the Standalone and integrated ENL programs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
    Content area instruction is delivered in compliance with the legislative mandates and directives for each ELL program as 
described in CR Part 154.  Content area instruction is delivered in all models at PS 91.  The Standalone and integrated  models 
of instruction are delivered in English using a variety of teaching strategies.  Students at P.S. 91 are continuously instructed 
within the core curriculum areas to meet the mandated content learning standards.  Additionally Science and Social Studies 
instructional time allocation each week conforms to CR Part 154 requirements.  The ENL teacher scaffolds the content area 
instruction by providing language structures in a small group setting. Some of the strategies used to accomplish this are, 
graphic organizers, visuals, multi-media, pictures, TPR, story maps, time lines, graphs, diagrams etc. Students use a wide 
variety of instructional materials to assist their language development within the core curriculum.  Instruction is based on the 
students’ ability level, whether they are special education, newcomers or long term ELLs.  The Ready Gen Program promotes 
small group work in both the verbal and written form.  The model utilizes such strategies as authors chair, accountable talk, 
turn and talk and writing celebrations.  The use of computer technology to assist the ELL students is available and will be 
increased each year to meet the needs of our language learners.  Standalone and integrated  models allow the ENL instructor 
to better service the ENL population in both small group and individual instruction through varied teaching strategies such as 
scaffolding instruction, partner stories, response groups, peer editing, maintaining journals, conferencing, read aloud, 
accountable talk, shared reading, as well as other strategies.  ENL students are taught in the content areas through inquiry, 
modeling, word webs, graphic organizers, visuals and through the use of manipulatives. These are all in an effort to promote 
the learning of academic language in the content areas.  Both the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher have a wide variety 
of materials to use with the children.  Some of the materials used are leveled libraries with both fiction and non fiction books 
so children can read at the appropriate level, Imagine Learning English, Phonics, journals, visual aids, word and phonics games, 
Go Math, picture dictionaries, listening centers, charts, writing folders, writing centers and a wide variety of manipulative 
materials to be used in the content areas.  All of these teaching techniques are designed to promote the learning of academic 
language for our ELL students so they can succeed in all areas of their education.   
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Based on the student's records and interviews with parents, we determine the amount of schooling the student has had in 
their home language.  This, along with classroom observations, helps us to determine their level of literacy in their home 
language and bridge the gap between their home language and English.  Ongoing assessment of home  language skills does not 
go on throughout the year because P.S. 91 does not currently have any Bilingual classes which would constantly be evaluating 
the students in their home languages.  There is also continuous congruence between ENL teachers and classroom teachers.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

PS 91 differentiates instruction for all subgroups.  When a student enters PS 91 an analysis of the student’s past enrollment in 
school is conducted.   
a.   Teachers would implement other strategies to help these students move forward such as establishing partnerships in the 
classrooms. Flexible and differentiated groupings could be established to meet these students' needs . ENL and classroom 
teachers could integrate to provide additional support for these students. At-risk counseling would be provided by our 
Guidance Counselor, Intervention Specialist and Parent Coordinator.  If the student is determined to be SIFE (interrupted 
schooling), he/she is given RTI such as the Fundations Program (K-2) if shown needed.  SIFE students often need additional 
help with their basic language acquisition.  PS 91 uses strategies such as total physical response, repetition and visual aids in all 
content areas to help our SIFE students acquire English.  We also provide the computer program, Imagine Learning English to 
assist them with their language acquisition.  This help is provided by our fully certified ESL teachers using strategies to develop 
oral language and listening skills.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

  
b.  Newcomer ELLs are assessed to determine the level of performance.  Appropriate teaching strategies are given to them 
such as TPR, partners, academic language webs and repetition to increase their English skills.   They also use glossaries, word 
to word dictionaries, translated computer software, picture dictionaries and multicultural text. They are further supported 
through partnership and buddy systems. To accelerate our ELL students English, they are placed on computer program, 
Imagine Learning English, which differentiates instruction as per the individual students needs.  Content specific scaffolds  for 
language acquisition are provided to ELL students to assist them in class and to prepare them for the ELA. The students are 
also given RTI to help them succeed on all standardized tests as well as the classroom. 
  
c.  Students who are developing are assessed for their strengths and weaknesses in the English language.  Based on the data 
collected on them (Running Records, Interim assessments, formal and informal assessments), an appropriate educational 
intervention in their area or areas of weakness are provided. PS 91 uses strategies such as total physical response, repetition 
and visual aids in all content areas to help our Developing students acquire English.   AIS are provided in all 4 modalities as per 
the need of the student. 
  
d.  Long term ELLs are reviewed by our staff and administration to determine why the student has not yet become proficient in 
the English Language.  After analyzing data, a specific AIS plan for each individual student is created to address their academic 
needs. Reading and writing interventions are provided are provided by small group instruction within the classroom during all 
curriculum areas. 
  
e.   ELL students who reach proficiency on the NYSESLAT are closely monitored for the next two years to see how they are 
performing on their own.  They are service by an ELL teacher for .5 of a unit of Integrated HLA.  PS 91 looks at all their data to 
determine if they are in need of any extra support.  If the student shows some areas of weakness, AIS is provided for that 
student as per their need.  All ELL students who have passed their NYSESLAT are still entitled to testing modifications for two 
more years.  Upon passing the NYSESLAT, students are assessed by both formal and informal tools that classroom teachers use 
to determine if more academic interventions are needed.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our ENL teachers use many instructional strategies to promote the learning of academic language in the content areas for our 
ELL-SWD's.  Our ELL - SWD students will use the ReadyGen and GoMath programs. Both programs provide scaffolds for ELL's 
and SWD's.  They use grade level materials in both the Teachers College Writing Workshop and Ready Gen to instruct the 
students.  Scaffolding strategies such as graphic organizers, computer based programs, word webs, Juicy work (sentence 
deconstruction), visuals, modeling, partner, Go Math manipulatives  help promote the understanding of grade appropriate 
work.  Rleady Gen provides the teachers access digitally to the Scaffold Handbook which helps the teachers integrate different 
tasks for instruction.  Teacher created curriculum maps that show differentiated tasks for ELL's and SWD's are shared via 
Google Docs and Office 365 so there is coherence across the grades. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our ESL teachers integrate into Grade level ELL classrooms to provide the least amount of disruption to the daily schedules of 
our ELL's and SWD learners.  PS91 has two common preps on each grade so that both the ENL teachers and the grade level 
classroom teachers can be on the same page to support our ELL-SWD's with attaining their IEP goals and language 
acquisition.  We mainstream our ELL/SWD students to provide more rigorous academic instruction in the least restrictive 
learning environment.  Students are exposed to additional strategies based on those suggested on the Engage NY website. 
Flexible programming is being implemented this year to ensure  that ALL students needs are being met through additional 
support within small group learning individualized to meet them at their access points. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

PS 91 uses many intervention programs both in and out of the classroom to better service our children who are in need of 
extra help.  After a school wide data analysis we were able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of our students.   This is 
done through inquiry work, analysis of conference notes, teacher observations and critical analysis of running records.  We 
utilize The Wilson Reading Program, Engage NY, Imagine Learning English and LLI (Leveled Literacy Intervention) to help our 
struggling readers.  We will continue to implement The Imagine Learning English Program for our ELL students this 
year.   Ready Gen and Go Math scaffolding  methods are used to help our ELL students in all content areas.  It focuses on Social 
Studies, Science, Math and the development of content area vocabulary acquisition. Through the support of our Queens North 
Field Support Center, ENL teachers have been given professional development to teach content area subjects.  PS 91 uses the 
support materials provided in Ready Gen and Go Math.  Social Studies and Science are intertwined in non fiction Reading and 
Writing units of study.  
Ready Gen and Go Math accomplish this task by scaffolding the content area curriculum over all learning levels.  For our early 
grades, Fundations and word study programs are also given to our ELLs who are in need of AIS.  Go Math is used to help our 
ELLs by scaffolding its approach to learning Math.  The continued focus is the learning of academic vocabulary in all content 
areas.  All AIS is taught in English to our ENL students. Content specific scaffolds  for language acquisition are provided to ELL 
students to assist them in class and to prepare them for the ELA. The students are also given AIS to help them succeed on all 
standardized tests as well as the classroom.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Data and trends indicate that there is a very strong need for ELL to make gains in their reading, writing and Math 
proficiency.  We have implemented inquiry teams to analyze this data and come up with workable strategies to augment ENL 
instruction throughout the school. This coming year there will be an increased use of technology in the classroom for 
educators and ELL students.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All school programs offered to non-ELL students are also offered to ELL students.  All ELLs are entitled to come to our before 
school and after school programs.  They are invited to these programs via letter.  ELL students stay for our extended day 
program to get more targeted AIS in both English and Math.  ELL's participate in all curricular and extracurricular programs, 
such as computer based programs like Imagine Learning English, MYON Reading etc.  They participate in all classroom 
educational instruction as well as assembly programs and trips.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Both the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher have a wide variety of materials to use with the children.  Scaffolded 
instruction is provided to our ELLs to support the instruction in the Teachers College Writing Workshop, Ready Gen and Go 
Math.   PS 91 uses computer based programs like Imagine Learning English program, MYON Reading to help support our ELL's 
in English.  Some of the other materials used are leveled libraries with both fiction and non fiction books so children can read 
at the appropriate level, journals, visual aids, word and phonics games, graphic organizers,  computer based English and math 
programs, picture dictionaries, listening centers, charts, writing folders, writing centers and a wide variety of manipulatives to 
be used in the content areas.  Both the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher utilize these strategies on a daily basis to help 
assess student’s needs and the products that they produce.  Entering and Emerging students are taught with more hands on 
materials such as visuals with labels, graphic organizers , books with pictures and conversation cards.  Transitional and 
Expanding students are taught with appropriate scaffolds such as graphic organizers, shared reading and writing and guided 
reading to help them attain language proficiency.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our ELL and regular classrooms HLA is supported through the use of the Imagine Learning English computer program and its 
home language support which this program provides.  Some home language books, glossaries, dictionaries and access to the 
internet help students acquire content area knowledge in our classrooms.  Whenever possible,  our students are paired with

other speakers of their home language to act as translators.  Our school is very culturally diverse and celebrates all our 
student's cultures.  PS 91 currently does not have any TBE or Dual Language programs.  Home language support may be given 
in Free Standing ENL programs in a variety of ways. Home language libraries and textbooks are available for ELLs who require 
their support. Technology based programs such as Imagine Learning are used. Home language support. In addition, classroom 
and support teachers may give home language support to individual students on a case by case basis. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required support services and resources for ELLs are determined according to the individual students’ grade and ability as 
indicated by their NYSESLAT results. AIS providers also support students according to their individual needs.  Student peers 
provide assistance to students who speak the same language when possible All required services, support, and resources that 
correspond to ELL’s according to their ages and grade levels are met through collaborative planning time being built into the 
schedule for the grade teams and ELL teachers to meet. All ENL students receive their full services/resources and support by 
licensed ENL instructors as well as both classroom and out of classroom staff that work with them. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Both the ENL teacher and the classroom teacher have a wide variety of materials to use with the children.  Scaffolded 
instruction is provided to our ELLs to support the instructions in Ready Gen and Go Math.   PS 91 uses computer based 
programs like Imagine Learning English program, MYON to help support our ELL's in English.  Some of the other materials used 
are leveled libraries with both fiction and non fiction books so children can read at the appropriate level, journals, visual aids, 
word and phonics games, graphic organizers,  computer based English and math programs, picture dictionaries, listening 
centers, charts, writing folders, writing centers and a wide variety of manipulatives to be used in the content areas.  Both the 
classroom teacher and the ENL teacher utilize these strategies on a daily basis to help assess student’s needs and the products 
that they produce.     
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Parents of newcomers are invited to the Jump Start Program before the beginning of the school year. The goal of this program 
is for parents of newly enrolled ELLs and the students themselves to become familiar with the program options and the staff 
members.  Parents are given a tour of PS 91 prior to enrollment of their child to familiarize themselves with the school, classes 
available and our school policies.  Our parent coordinator meets with them to discuss any concerns they might have.  ENL 
parent workshops are provided during the year by the parent coordinator to help address any their concerns.  Our school 
website which has a translation function on it helps disseminate information to parents in their home language.  Letters sent 
home are posted on this website and can be translated with the click of a button.  Parents of new ELLs are given an ELL 
orientation whenever they arrive during the school year.  Students are afforded the opportunity to take part in all morning and 
after school programs that PS 91 offers.   All parents are met with by the ENL teacher at least once a year in addition to parent 
conferences to discuss the needs and progress of their child. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

PS 91 does not offer language electives to our students.      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The PD’s will include teaching strategies, demonstrations, and ENL information crucial to educators. Support is provided by 
Queens North Support Field Center, ENL staff developers and the sharing of best practices among colleagues who teach 
ELLs.  Outside ELL PD's are shared among teachers of ELLs.      
Teachers of ELLs participate in numerous professional development opportunities including those offered by OELL and our 
regional support personnel and the sharing of in house expertise.  These PD's help the staff to maintain 15% of the PD hours in 
ENL instruction as required.  ENL teachers attend PD's both in school and outside PD's to maintain their 50% PD hours in ENL 
instruction.  All PD opportunities help our ELL teachers better prepare our students to meet the CCLS.   Some of the 
professional developments given will be: 
 
 November 60 minute ENL workshop on strategies for ELL instruction on aligning ENL with core curriculum instruction. 
•   December 60 minute ENL workshop on the four modalities of the NYSESLAT 
•   January 60 minute ENL workshop on developing effective classroom environments for the ENL for        Beginning and 
Newcomer ENL students.               
•   February 60 minute ENL workshop on strategies for preparing for the NYSESLAT  
•   May 60 minute ENL workshop on sharing best practices and reflecting on the new NYSESLAT 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 Our staff receives support to assist ELLs in their smooth transition to middle school.  Such support includes parent teacher 
conferences, interpretation of records and middle school requirements and articulation among teachers of elementary and 
middle schools.  
Our ENL professional development is geared to help the staff help ELL students to achieve the Common Core and NYS ENL 
standards in both ELA and math. The staff including the Principal, Assistant Principals, Paraprofessionals, Guidance Counselors, 
Parent Coordinator as well as all teachers and related service providers who work with ELL students will receive five 60-minute 
ENL workshops.  ENL specialists both in house and outside providers will give these workshops.  It will also focus on how to 
prepare our staff to help ELL students in Grades K-5 to meet and exceed the Common Core and NYS ENL learning and 
performance standards and achieve higher scores on all city and state assessments.  In addition, professional development is 
also given during the ten 50 minute grade conferences on strategies for teaching ELL’s. We will also have staff development on 
ELL strategies during our professional development days during the year.  Staff members are also made aware of all ELL 
professional development opportunities available through the OELL.  We plan to implement professional development for 
classroom teachers to instruct them in ENL strategies and methodologies.  Information regarding standardized tests is also 
provided.  These PD's help the staff to maintain 15% of the PD hours in ENL instruction as required.  ENL teachers 
attend PD's both in school and outside PD's to maintain their 50% PD hours in ENL instruction.  Records of PD's are maintained 
in a binder in the Principal's office. 
Some additional workshops provided are:  
•     November 60 minute ENL workshop on strategies for ELL instruction on aligning ENL with core curriculum instruction. 
•     December 60 minute ENL workshop on the four modalities of the NYSESLAT 
•     January 60 minute ENL workshop on developing effective classroom environments for the ENL for Beginning and 
Newcomer ENL students.           
•     February 60 minute ENL workshop on strategies for preparing for the NYSESLAT  
•     May 60 minute ENL workshop on sharing best practices and reflecting on the new NYSESLAT

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S. 91 has a built in parent communication time each week on Tuesday afternoons right after school that enables the ENL 
teachers to provide for individual meetings for parents with ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development 
progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas.  Appointments are 
set up throughout the year by the ENL teacher for these conferences.  If interpretation or translation is required it will be 
provided by our staff or the Language Interpretation Unit.  Copies of sign in sheets, parent letters and phone logs will be kept 
by the ELL teacher in a binder.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The parents of ELL students are invited to attend Parent Orientation meetings conducted by our parent coordinator.   Parent 
Orientation meetings are held during the year. The first is held in September with ENL teachers and the Parent 
Coordinator.  The meeting is designed to inform parents about the ENL programs that are available at P.S. 91 and around the 
city.  Parents are given a survey and they make an informed choice as to which ELL program will be best for their child.  The 
parents can ask questions, read about the programs and watch an informative video.  A designated parent developer along 
with ENL teachers are at hand to assist the parents in their choice of programs.  Students who are eligible for ENL are placed in 
an available program based on parent choice.  Notification letters in various languages are sent to the parents of all ELL 
children.  Letters in various languages are sent home to parents to invite them to attend additional workshops during the year 
to learn about, assessments, standards, new curriculum and how to help their child at home. Translation services are provided 
through our parent coordinator to meet the needs of our ELL parents.  PS 91 has a website that parents can use that describes 
all activities that go on at school.  The website provides access to administration, teachers and the parent coordinator by 
email.  Translations are also available on our website into native languages. A needs assessment is sent out to our parents so 
they can pick workshops that they would like to attend.  Workshops are then scheduled.  This is done to meet the needs of our 
parents.

are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The primary language of the parent is determined by the interview given during the Home Language Survey. 
Parents are asked on the HLIS form in what language they wish to correspond. If a language other than English is 
needed, an interpreter is provided by the school for all communications with the parent. Home Language 
Identification Surveys are retained by the ESL specialist and classroom teacher in the students cumulative file. 
Emergency cards are all maintained in our schools general office. Funds are available for paraprofessionals and 
school aides to be present for open school night so that translations can be made at teacher/parent request. PS 
91 insures that all parents who do not speak English can have information adequately disseminated to them in 
their native language.
