Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Mission Statement: Our goal is to educate all children to their maximum potential. We celebrate our unique 
differences while focusing on the development of academic skills, creativity, responsibility and citizenship. P.S. 13 
functions as a team of teachers, staff members, parents, administrators and the community. By cooperatively working 
together we will make a difference. We believe that every child who comes to P.S. 13 is worthy of respect and deep 
consideration. We are here to provide a structured, creative environment for our students. This includes the basic 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

academic areas, computer technology, as well as, the development of social responsibility and self-discipline. We 
believe that it is our obligation to challenge each child to achieve his/her potential. It is our responsibility to help 
develop those understandings, skills and attitudes that help each child become and effective human being in society. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 13 is a PreK-5 elementary school situated in the Rosebank neighborhood of Staten Island. The student body is 
culturally diverse, with many languages spoken at home, including English, Polish, Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese, 
Spanish and Albanian, among others. In recognition of this diversity, we embrace efforts that promote cultural 
awareness, and tolerance of differences.  

 

P.S. 13 is rather unique among Staten Island public elementary schools. While many regions of the island can be 
insular and culturally homogeneous, P.S. 13 is a true melting pot of cultures and socio-economic strata. We are 
geographically only minutes from the Staten Island Ferry and the Verrazano Bridge. 

 

P.S. 13 has committed itself to optimizing the mandated curriculum using best instructional practices. Using 
collaborative assessment, student self-assessment, success criteria, curriculum mapping, and collection of data from 
various sources, we have developed a means to implement rigor in the curriculum, differentiate instruction, and 
promote accountability within the context of school wide goals and support.  

 

We have built strong partnerships with the following local organizations: PAL, UAU, Alice Austen House, MakerSpace, 
and Universal Temple of the Arts. During the 2016-2017 school year, we were awarded a Disney Musicals in the 
Schools grant. We look forward to producing our third musical during the 2018-2019 school year.  

 

P.S. 13 believes in giving back to our community. Through our successful yield of our garden crops, we have donated 
our harvest to Good Counsel Home for Single Mothers and Project Hospitality for the past three years. In addition, we 
were selected to be a pilot school for the Cooking Matters program in the 2017-2018 school year and intend to 
continue the program this upcoming year. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Of our 885 students currently enrolled, 161 or 18.1% are English Language Learners and 204 or 23.0% are Students 
with IEPs. As indicated by the following data, ELL students in Grades 3-5 consistently score below our English 
Proficient students on the NYS ELA Assessment and Students with IEPs score below both ELL students and students 
without IEPs. Data from the 2018 NYS ELA Assessments indicate that while 55.3% of our English Proficient students 
(including those with IEPs) scored at or above proficiency, only 23.4% of our ELLs scored at or above proficiency. Only 
17.1% of our students with disabilities scored at or above proficiency as compared to 61.4% of our general education 
students and 23.4% of our ELL students. 

In addition, data from the June 2018 K to 5 Teachers College Assessment indicate: 84.6% of our General Education 
students scored at or above proficiency while 47.3% of our ELLs and 36.5% of our Students with IEPs scored at or 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

above proficiency. The average proficiency ratings are as follows: 3.32 (general education students), 2.23 (ELLs), and 
2.01 (students with IEPs). 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Although P.S. 13’s scores were well above those of the district and the city in all the elements of the Framework for 
Great Schools, our school made the most progress in Rigorous Instruction, Collaborative Teachers, and Effective 
School Leadership as indicated in the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide. Professional Development sessions incorporate 
carefully planned activities designed to be complimentary and interwoven with one another. Throughout all our 
collaborative professional development sessions, teachers consider, create, evaluate, discuss, and revise rigorous 
curriculum. We then hold each other accountable through classroom inter-visitations and reflection of student work. 
Results of our rigorous instruction are evident in the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide as we scored 3.49 in Student 
Achievement. This score reflects: student growth and performance, how students performed in core courses, and 
how well students are prepared for middle school. 

 

Our area of focus will be Supportive Environment wherein we plan to continue to work rigorously in “Closing the 
Achievement Gap” in ELA for our lowest performing students. Aspects of our plan are: to have this element included 
in our Assistant Principals' goals, and optimally utilize small group instruction to meet the needs of these students.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

 

  Data from the 2017-2018 ELA State Assessment indicate that 50.5% of our Grade 3 to 5 students scored at or 

above proficiency level. This is a 9.4% increase from the 2016-2017 ELA State Assessment in which 41.1% of 
our students scored at or above proficiency level. 

  Data from June 2018 Teachers College Assessment indicate: 84.6% of our General Education students scored 

 

 

at or above proficiency; 47.3% of our ELLs scored at or above proficiency; and, 36.5% of students with IEPs 
scored at or above proficiency. 
In the Educator Guide to the 2018 Common Core ELA Test, the following lexile ranges for quantitative 
measures were used: Grades 2-3 Common Core Band: Lexile Range of 420 to 820; Grades 4-5 Common Core 
Band: Lexile Range of 740 to 1010. 
In June 2018, as indicated by the Teachers College Reading Assessment, the average benchmark of all 
students in grades K through 5 was 2.89. This is a .08 increase from the June 2017 average benchmark in 
independent reading levels of all students in grades K through 5. 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, as a result of before- and after-school programs and Grades 1-5 classroom, ICT and ENL teachers 
providing rigorous and differentiated LLI and Orton-Gillingham instruction to students reading below grade level, there 
will be a 30% increase (from 0% to 30%) of those targeted students who will read at or above grade level as measured 
by the 2019 end-of-year Teachers College Assessment results.

In the Educator Guide to the 2018 Common Core ELA Test, the following lexile ranges for quantitative 
measures were used: Grades 2-3 Common Core Band: Lexile Range of 420 to 820; Grades 4-5 Common Core 
Band: Lexile Range of 740 to 1010. 

  Data from June 2018 Teachers College Assessment indicate: 84.6% of our General Education students scored 

at or above proficiency; and, 47.3% of our ELLs scored at or above proficiency. 

  Data from the 2016 NYS ELA Assessments indicate that: while, 39.7% of our English Proficient students 

(including those with IEPs) scored at or above proficiency, only 4.5% of our ELLs scored at or above 
proficiency. 

  Data from 2017 NYC ELA Assessment indicate that, on average, our ELLs were outperformed by our English 
Proficient students in a majority of constructed response items. On average, our English Proficient students 
scored 1.30 (Grade 3), 1.33 (Grade 4), and 1.61 (Grade 5) points on all constructed response items as opposed 
to 1.15 (Grade 3), 1.06 (Grade 4), and 1.33 (Grade 5) for our ELL students. 

  Our 2015-2016 Quality Review maintained we are a “Well-Developed” school. However, we rated “Proficient” 
for indicator 1.2 (Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that 
is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, 
engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products). 

  NYSESLAT results consistently indicate that our ELLs have a lower score in the Writing modality as compared 

to the other modalities assessed on the exam. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 40% (16) of our 40 targeted ELLs in Grades 2-5 will increase their Raw Score Writing Modality by 2 
points as indicated on the 2019 NYSESLAT Assessment.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
  Data from the 2017-2018 NYS Math Assessment indicate that, on average, students in all tested grades score 

less on constructed response items than on multiple choice items in all modalities. 

  Our 2015-2016 Quality Review maintained we are a “Well-Developed” school. However, we rated “Proficient” 
for indicator 1.2 (Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how students learn best that 
is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, 
engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products). 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of Grades 3 through 5 classroom teachers providing rigorous instruction and receiving teacher 
professional development, there will be a 5% increase (Grade 3: 55% to 60%; Grade 4: 53% to 58%; Grade 5: 37% to 
42%) in the average percentage of total possible points received on constructed response items as measured by the 
2019 NYS Math Assessment.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Students will receive comprehensive instruction on utilizing the 
S.O.L.V.E. and Fact Masters protocols to be used during 
constructed response activities. Strong emphasis will be placed 
on solving word problems focusing on the standards being 
taught during each module of NYS Core Curriculum Math. 
Emphasis on these standards will also be placed during the 
before-school program and Saturday Academy with 
differentiated instruction as needed. 

Before-school instruction 3 days per week for our neediest 
students will be scheduled for Grades 1-5. 

Planning for our Saturday Academy will take place in early 2019. 
Targeted students will be invited to attend these Saturday 
sessions for review of standards and test-taking skills. 

 

During the Professional Learning Cycles, all IEP/SETSS teachers 
will meet with grade-band teachers to inform them on how to 
access IEP information and suggest instructional strategies based 
on individual student IEPs. Lessons will be created and designed 
by the SETSS teacher to adhere to IEP requirements while the 
classroom teachers will correlate these lessons to the Success 
Criteria methods gleaned from Paul Bloomberg. 

ELL teachers will suggest appropriate instructional strategies that 
are in line with ELL levels. In addition to our IEP/SETSS teachers 
and ELL teachers, the UFT Teachers Center will provide a 
facilitator to suggest additional strategies and best practices. 

Professional Development will be provided by National Training 
Network (NTN), if funding allows or facilitated by a staff member. 
Each teacher will be given the Items Skills Analysis specific to 
his/her class with the expectation of using the data for each 
classroom’s needs. This will be facilitated by our in-house coach.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
  Citing our 2015-2016 School Quality Guide, we exceeded the target in the following sections: Rigorous 

Instruction, Collaborative Teachers, Supportive Environment, Effective School Leadership, Strong Family-
Community Ties, and Trust. 

  Our 2015-2016 Quality Review maintained we are a "Well-Developed" school. However, we rated "Proficient" 
for indicator 1.2 (Develop teacher pedagogy from a coherent set of beliefs about how student learn best that 
is informed by the instructional shifts and Danielson Framework for Teaching, aligned to the curricula, 
engaging, and meets the needs of all learners so that all students produce meaningful work products). 

  Citing from our Quality Review findings re: Indicator 1.2, the reviewer stated: "The use of questioning and 

scaffolds support students in appropriately challenging tasks but have yet to lead to extensions about 
ownership in student discussion and work products." 

  As a follow-up to a district visit, it was decided to concentrate on the development of authentic tasks to 

complement the school-wide focus of self-assessment. It was determined that teachers cannot assess 
accurately unless a task is created that is properly aligned to the standard. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, as a result of in-house and out-of-house professional development series, there will be a 12% increase 
(from 18% to 30%) in the percentage of teachers that receive a highly effective rating in component 3C of the Danielson 
Rubric as measured by the end of year summative ratings in Advance.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          39 

 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 13, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. Our 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.

Morning Literacy Academy - Title III Program 
-              Rationale:  Upon reviewing our NYSESLAT and T-Clas data, we have found that our 
ELL students are not always meeting their grade level reading benchmark.  Our 
NYSESLAT data shows that our students with levels of Emerging and Transitioning begin to 
show growth in their oral language but are scoring low in the reading modality.  In order to meet 
their needs and help them move reading levels, we have created a morning literacy 
academy.  We will focus on strengthening phonemic awareness, decoding, comprehension, and 
fluency. Additionally, we will address writing skills at this time.  After analyzing our data from 
the NYSESLAT and ELA, our students need more support when writing about their 
reading.  The Morning Literacy Academy is intended to strengthen their writing skills in terms of 
content and mechanics.  Utilizing our guided interactive read aloud protocol we intend to engage 
the students in academic oral language and culminate activities with a writing prompt gleaned 
from the prior class conversations.    
 
    -          Subgroups and Grade Levels to be Served:  This program will provide additional small 
group reading support for ELLs in grades 1-5 that are currently receiving a reading grade of a 
Level 1 or low Level 2.  Some subgroups of students to be served will include Entering and 
Emerging ELLs, Transitioning and Emerging ELLs, newcomer ELLs, and ELLs with IEPs. 
 
- Schedule and Duration:  This program will begin in October 2, 2018 and continue through May 
3, 2019.  The program will run for 30 weeks and take place for 60 minutes, three times per week 
on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursday.  This program will continue the following school year 
from September 2019-May 2019. 
    
- Language of Instruction: English 
 
- Home Language Support:  Bilingual dictionaries, myON, Raz-Kids 
 
- Number and Types of Certified Teachers: 2 ESL Teachers and 2 Common Branch Teachers 
 
- Types of Materials: Our program is data driven and will utilize teacher created materials.  We 
will also utilize Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Instruction Kits, published by 
Heinemann Publishing, to help move students reading levels at an accelerated 
pace.  Mondo posters will be used to generate oral language and writing.  Consumable supplies 
for the ELL students to use in the program such as paper, pencils, marble notebooks, 
highlighters, etc will also be purchased with funding.  These materials are supplemental from 
those used in daily instruction.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
 
- Activities/Grouping: Students will be engaged in small group instruction based on current 
Independent Reading Levels.  Instruction is based on the needs of the students and driven by the 
Common Core Standards. Activities may include, guided reading, word work, and shared 
reading in order to increase students' fluency, decoding, and comprehension skills.  Additionally, 
students and teachers will utilize web-based subscriptions to MYON and Raz-Kids.  Students 
will also be encouraged to build their oral language and writing skills through the use of 
Mondo posters.      
 
- Records: Records will be maintained through the use of attendance sheets and agendas.  Copies 
of these records will be on file in the ELL office.

Begin description here:            
There are many parental engagement activities targeted toward our ELL parents. Our parent 
coordinator schedules workshops with facilitators from Sylvan Learning Center,  Health Plus, 
and Dial-a-Teacher.  Our parents of Title III students and parents of ELLs are invited to learn 
ways in which they can help their child at home.  Translators are present to ensure that our 
parents understand the information.  These parents are also invited to monthly family nights 
where they can participate with their students in learning activities.  During these nights and 
parent teacher conference nights, workshops are held to explain different learning tools to our 
parents such as Myon, the online science textbooks, and our school's website which can be 
translated into different languages.  Parents of ELLs are also invited to attend numerous Open 
School Weeks during the year.  These events are literacy or math based.  The parents are invited 
to watch a lesson and complete work with their children in their classroom.  They then debrief 
with the literacy and math coach to further understand the work that was completed.  Translators 
are present to help explain this information in the home language of the parents.  We also utilize 
Tuesday afternoon to communicate with our parents and discuss student progress.  Translators 
assist where necessary. 
Current/Tentative Schedule of Parent Engagement Activities: 
     Family Fun Night (Career Night) (10/2019)

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The formative assessments utilized within our program are Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Project assessment tools, 
namely T-Clas and running records.  T-Clas assesses the students letter and word recognition, reading fluency, retelling and 
comprehension.  Additionally our school is working on creating a Language Acquisition Continuum to more accurately assess 
and track our students language acquisition progress.  Our data provides us with a great deal of insight about our ELL 
population.  Using this data, children are placed into small groups where instruction can be differentiated and scaffolded 
according to their needs and level. 
 
Data from our T-Clas administration informs us that our ELLs are able to recall key details, but struggle with retelling stories 
and making inferences.  This information is used by the ENL and classroom teachers while planning instruction for whole class 
and small group lessons.  Teachers can use the students strengths to guide them through the work that is more difficult.  Also, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

teachers are able to create scaffolds for struggling students to be able to confidently complete tasks that are presented to 
them.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Our classroom teachers receive support from the ENL teachers to carry our the task of assessing our ELL students in an 
accurate and timely manner.  Assessment calendars are created to provide teachers with accurate information about 
assessment schedules and deadlines.   
 
School leadership disseminates assessment findings to staff during our Monday and Tuesday Professional Learning 
Cycle.  Administrators meet with teacher teams to review assessment findings and discuss implications on our instruction.   
 
During Team Meetings, held every three weeks, and common prep periods teacher teams also discuss assessment findings and 
use the information to drive instruction.  Collaboratively teachers use data in their instructional planning efforts.  Teachers 
look for trends across sub groups and the grade as a whole.            
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
To identify baseline, progress, and areas of need for our students, we use the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT. 
We also look at the growth of our ELLs on their state reading and math assessments.  Progress is measured by looking at the 
students academic yearly progress on these assessments.  Teachers look at the level of the students as a whole and specific 
modalities.  We make appropriate instructional decisions based on the data from these assessments.  Based on our data, our 
students need to improve their writing skills.  Specifically, the ELLs need to elaborate on their details and clearly express their 
thoughts.             
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered, teachers meet in teacher teams to plan appropriate interventions to utilize 
within their classrooms and school wide intervention programs.  ENL teachers and classroom teachers work together during 
common planning time and within the classrooms to provide their students with support in small groups during a Response to 
Intervention program.  This program takes place in each grade for one period each day.  Administrators and teacher teams 
collaborate to plan the schedule for this program.  During the Professional Learning Cycle, or common prep periods, teachers 
use the available data to accurately group students.  This time is also utilized by the teachers to plan and create engaging 
instruction that will meet the specific needs of the students in their groups and address the interventions based on the 
summative data.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school implements RTI across all grades.  At grade meetings classroom level achievement is examined.  Teacher teams 
discuss student work samples by drawing on multiple sources of information.  For example, teachers look at student work, 
such as lesson based exit slips and unit tasks, across the grade, including samples from ELLs, general education students, and 
special education students.  In these meetings teachers analyze the work and decide upon appropriate interventions that can 
be put in place.  ENL teachers are also present at the teacher team meetings to provide their expertise in regards to the 
language acquisition of the students.  Once the appropriate supplemental support is identified, teachers conduct meaningful 
small group work designed to target the student's areas of deficiency.  Progress is monitored over time to plan for appropriate 
mid-course corrections or further academic support for specific students.  Assessments are conducted within the RTI cycle 
depending upon the intervention.  The assessments will serve as a tool to measure whether or not the intervention is 
working.  RTI groupings and topics change according to assessment and group work data.               
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use various outcome assessment data to evaluate and inform our ELL programs.  The NYSESLAT, ELA, and Math 
assessment data are analyzed and used to inform instruction. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

 
Based on the data, our school has improved it's ELL program.  Our ENL teachers are involved in our school wide 
RTI program.  ENL teachers and classroom teachers meet to analyze data, group students, and plan specifically targeted 
instruction.  Additionally, the ENL teachers have received Orton Gillingham training and Leveled Literacy Instruction training.    
 
Based on the data, there are also improvements that still need to be accomplished.  Moving forward, we will be incorporating 
more writing into our small group instruction.  We will be focusing on helping our ELLs to clearly express their 
ideas.  Additionally, we would like to see our ELLs use more specific details in their writing to enhance their writing.       
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The administration at PS 13 has scheduled time for the various teacher teams to meet weekly or monthly for a plethora of 
reasons.  For example, the ENL teacher team, comprised of ENL teachers and classroom teachers, meets every three 
weeks.  Here we can disseminate the findings from the assessments and makes appropriate adjustments to our programs 
using these findings.  Our administrators are present at these valuable meetings and accurate instructional decisions are 
made.     

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

1. Instruction is delivered utilizing the two types of ENL instruction, Integrated ENL and Standalone ENL.  We provide 
these types of instruction primarily utilizing a Push-In model.  An ENL teacher works in collaboration with a general 
education classroom teacher to provide language acquisition or vocabulary support within the classroom.  The ENL 
teacher and classroom teacher work collaboratively to plan and implement engaging Common Core based lessons 
that meet the needs of all learners.  Our school uses heterogeneous grouping across all grade levels.  Within each 
class the teacher has the ability to make small heterogeneous or homogeneous groups based on the needs of the 
student within each content area.  Standalone ENL is provided for our Entering and Emerging ELLs.  These children 
work in small groups with the ENL teacher.  The focus of this work is linked to their assessments.  Based on these 
assessments, ENL teachers plan engaging Common Core lessons that will support their students weaknesses.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The principal and assistant principals require copies of the ENL teachers schedules.  The administration and ELL coordinator 
monitor that all ELL students are receiving the required number of minutes of instruction.  There are three ENL teachers 
facilitating the ELL program, all of whom are dually certified in TESOL and Common Branch.  All Entering and Emerging ELL 
students receive 360 minutes per week of ENL with the appropriate time of standalone ENL and integrated ENL instructional 
minutes.  All Transitioning and Emerging ELL students receive 180 minutes per week of ENL instruction with the appropriate 
amount of time utilizing the standalone or integrated approaches.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes of ENL 
instruction.  Student schedules are also inputted in STARS.  To further assist in ensuring that the mandated number of minutes 
are provided we strategically organized our classes in June for the following September.  ELLs were placed into the same class 
on each grade level.  This enables our ELL teachers to deliever ENL instructional minutes utilizing the integrated ENL and 
standalone ENL models efficiently and effectively.     
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Since our school uses a Freestanding English as a New Language program, content area subjects are taught in English utilizing 
ENL strategies and Native Language support if needed.  Students are immersed in the English Language through Common Core 
Standard based reading and writing programs.  Our current reading and writing program is CKLA.  CKLA units are theme based 
and have a heavy focus on Science and Social Studies.  In addition, we incorporate the close reading protocol into our reading 
curriculum.  Teachers use grade level texts to teach the students how dive deeper into their reading.  There is focus on 
vocabulary, specifically in understanding tier two and tier three words, which is very helpful for our ENL students.  The ELL 
teachers push-in to reading and writing periods using a plethora of strategies to help scaffold instruction which is delivered in 
English.  Such methods and instructional approaches include front loading vocabulary, incorporating picture support, 
deconstructing academic language, leading small groups (guided reading/strategy lessons), accountable talk, higher order 
thinking questions, and tiered activities.  We also utilize MYON in grades k-5 to provide our ELLs with content material at 
differentiated reading levels .  This is a wonderful resource, especially for our Spanish speaking ELLs.  MYON has a support 
setting for Spanish speaking children.  Additional native language support is provided by alternate placement paras and 
bilingual dictionaries.  In math, we use Engage New York.  These units are translated in Spanish, allowing us to provide support 
to the students and their parents.  In all content areas, ENL teachers provide support to the teachers, and therefore the ELLs, 
by their work in teacher team meetings.  ENL teachers collaborate with content area teachers to provide Common Core based 
material appropriate for their students' levels.  Some examples might include picture dictionaries specific topics, sentence 
frames and sentence starters, and differentiated tasks.  Most recently, our school utilizes Front Row.  Front Row is a web-
based subscription that allows the children to work on tasks specifically geared to their level in reading and math after taking 
an initial assessment.  It also moves with the child's progress and generates reports for teachers.        
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   Newly enrolled ELLs who speak Spanish at home are tested using the Spanish LAB.  The ELL teachers use translators to assist 
in accurately administering the exam.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The ELL teachers differentiate instruction to meet the needs of all ELL subgroups:  
a.     SIFE:  SIFE students are placed in a general education classroom where they receive the support of the ELL 
teacher.  Additionally, SIFE students will be pulled out of their class instruction to receive Standalone ENL minutes.  We 
differentiate instruction for our SIFE students by focusing on their areas of academic weakness.  Using assessments, we 
determine the concepts that these students are struggling with.  SIFE students work in small groups to improve their listening, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

speaking, reading and writing.  We differentiate the classroom material and also provide SIFE students with foundational 
support that they may be lacking from their previous school experience.  We focus on the standards and break them down as 
appropriate for our students to be successful.           
b.     Newcomer ELLs:  These children are placed in a general education classroom where they receive additional support from 
the ELL teachers.  The ELL newcomers are engaged in small group instruction to learn a strategy and then work with a group or 
a partner to practice the particular skill taught.  The students participate in engaging lessons based on the common core 
standards in reading, writing, listening, and speaking.  Additionally, our newcomers throughout grades k-5 attend a standalone 
ENL group that focuses on language development and basic reading skills.  We also invite these children to a morning program 
or an after school program focused on improving skills in reading and math, depending on their level.  These students also use 
technology throughout the day including laptops, smartbaords, and i-pads.  They use web-based subscriptions, including 
MYON, Raz-Kids, BrainPop, Follett, and Front Row.  We also utilize Orton Gillingham methodologies, Fundations and Fountas 
and Pinnell to assist our newcomers in learning how to read and write in English.         
c.     Developing ELLs:  These children receive their mandated minutes and work in small groups in order to meet their specific 
needs.  If necessary we further evaluate their needs through and offer them many of the interventions being used for our at 
risk population.  After analyzing NYSESLAT results we have determined the need to focus on reading and writing skills with the 
targeted population.  Running records are conducted to make sure that such students make appropriate use of our classrooms 
leveled libraries and reading for meaning at their appropritate levels while building their vocabulary.  MYON enables our ELLs 
to build reading skills and content based vocabulary, while working at their own level.  Students also use a web subscription to 
Raz-Kids to build reading stamina.  In addtion, teachers can utilize Follet, an online lending library to provide their students 
with extra resources.  These students can also utilize the web-based subscription, Front Row, to work on reading and math 
skills at their specific level.       
d.     Long Term ELLs:  These students receive instruction specific to their weaknesses while working in small groups with the 
ELL teacher.  Data is utilized to find deficient skills and lessons are differentiaeted using tactile and visual 
approaches.  Scaffolding techniques such as graphic organizers are utilized to ensure success in completing academic tasks.  
e.  Former ELLs:  Instruction is provided for the ELL students that have reached proficiency on the NYSESLAT for two years.  The 
ENL teachers monitor their progress within the classroom through conferencing and small group instruction.  The ELL teacher 
meets with the classroom teacher during their common prep to review the former ELLs student work and discuss possible 
weakness areas.  The weakness areas are addressed while working in small groups.  Additionally, the ELLs who have reached 
proficiency are invited to the ELL after school programs.  Former ELLs in grades 3-5 are on a master list for test 
modifications.  Their ELL modifications are granted for the 2 years after they pass the NYSESLAT.  Furthermore, former ELLs are 
called upon to assist newcomers in certain routines and activities.  They are often placed in groups where they can provide 
supprt to their peers in reading and writing.           
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Our ENL teachers collaborate with our special education teachers to provide accessible and engaging lessons to our ELL 
students with disabilities.  ELL teachers of students with disabilities have access to and utilize grade level common core 
standards in order to provide the students with academic content on their grade level.  They provide this instruction by tiering 
tasks, differentiating, and scaffolding grade level lessons .  The ELL teacher also utilizes ELL techniques and strategies such as 
front loading vocabulary, visual and tactile lessons, role-playing, realia, technology, and deconstructing language to accelerate 
English language development.  Performance indicators for each grade level are also utilized to ensure that ELLs with 
disabilities are meeting their grade level goals.  I-pads and laptops are used to further support ELL-SWDs.  Teachers create 
"Show Me" lessons where they video themselves modeling a skilll.  This helps our ELL-SWD to review a skill that has already 
been taught.  We also use podcasts to record parts of the text we're working with and have our students listen to it at another 
time.  Listening to grade appropriate material, will improve the listening and speaking skills of the ELL-SWDs.  This will help 
accelerate their English language development.  Our school has developed a language acquisition continuum to further assess 
and track language acquisition throughout the year.        
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

Our school uses a variety of curricular and instructional accommodations to meet the needs of our ELL students with 
disabilities.  For example, we utilize an array of tactile and visual techniques to differentiate instruction.  Technology in terms 
of laptops, I-pads, web based subscriptions, and smartboards are used to appeal to the different learning styles and facilitate 
their learning.  “Show me” lessons, where a teacher records their lesson on an I-pad, are offered for students who need to see 
the material a second time.  In terms of scheduling, the ELL teachers work with related service providers and the classroom 
teacher to ensure that the students are receiving all mandated services without conflict.  For our student's with disabilities our 
school ensures that flexible programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled peers.         
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Intervention programs are provided for all ELL students in math and ELA.  Our After School Reading and Math Academy is in 
place for all ELL students in grades 3-5.  In addition, students in the lower grades have the opportunity to receive additional 
support in reading.  Our Morning and Afternoon Reading Academies are in place to offer children in grades k-2, as well as 
newcomer ELLs in grade 3-5, with support geared towards increasing their reading proficiency.  The language of instruction is 
English.  The new ELL students are encouraged to use their native language as a tool for learning.  Materials are used to help 
transfer their native skills into English skills with the assistance of math resource books, picture dictionaries, bilingual glossaries 
in their native language, and google translator on our I-pads.  Many of our teachers are trained in the Leveled Literacy 
Intervention program and Orton Gillingham methodology.  Classroom teachers and out of class room service providers trained 
in these reading interventions provide support to ELL readers from kindergarten through fifth grade.  Social Studies is taught 
through literacy with our CKLA program.  Visual posters are used to explain difficult concepts.  We also use smartboards, I-
Pads, and laptops to show children clips or images of certain historical moments.  This helps ELLs to develop prior knowledge in 
English.  In Science classes, taught by experienced science pedagogues, our ELLs benefit from hands on models and 
experiments that they conduct in their classroom.  Science materials are also provided in Spanish for those students that 
would benefit from that intervention.  ELLs receive science instruction two to three times weekly.         
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We plan on continuing our current programs for the upcoming school year.  We will continue using CKLA for reading and 
writing.  CKLA units are theme based which is proven to help ELLs be more successful in their academic progress.  CKLA also 
provides a focus on content and academic vocabulary.  Professional development will be given to continue our efforts in 
scaffolding the units to make them accessible for our ELLs.  We have incorporated the Close Reading Protocol into our reading 
lessons and have seen positive growth in student reading behaviors.  In order to better assess and track our students in their 
language proficiency we will begin to utilize our newly created Language Acquisition Continuum.  The continuum is based off of 
the Bilingual Common Core Progressions.  We will continue utilizing MYON and Front Row for all students.  Accessing 
information about the content they are studying, on their level, will help the ELLs to be more successful when working with 
their content.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We did not have a bilingual program in our building. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our title III funding will be used to run a Morning Reading Academy, an After School Reading Academy, and an After School 
Math Academy.  The Morning Reading Academy was established to help children who are below grade level in reading.  There 
is an intense emphasis on phonemic awareness, decoding, and fluency, as well as comprehension strategies.  Our After School 
Reading and Math Academy offers enrichment in these core content areas.  These programs use classroom data to group the 
children and plan material that targets their areas of weakness.  Our ELLs are invited to attend these programs.  Notices are 
sent home in their home language, or phone calls are made with the help of translators.  Currently, our school offers an after 
school drama club and basketball program, both of which our ELLs are invited to join.  
 
We invite ELLs to these programs through translated memos or through the use of translators.  Often, the language and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

interpretation unit is utilized to explain information to the parent in a clear and concise way.  Additionally, our school website 
enables parent's to read about these programs in their native language.        
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Web based subscriptions are used to supplement the curriculum for our ELL students.  Front Row, MYON, Starfall.com, 
Razkids.com, and Brainpop.com have been purchased and are utilized.  These programs are used independently on classroom 
laptops or used during small group and whole class instruction with the use of Smartboards.  Our school website also offers 
support as it has a translation tool.  All correspondence sent home to parents can be viewed on the website in their native 
languages.  Our ENL office has a lending library of picture dictionaries and bilingual dictionaries to offer to our ELLs in their 
native languages.  In addition our school utilizes MYON online reading program.  This program can be used at home and in 
school to help our students grow as readers.  This website also provides access to books in Spanish.  Our school also utilizes I-
pads as a tool for instruction.  Teachers record "Show Me" lessons to re-teach concepts or provide additional practice to 
students.  I-pads are also utilized to provide prior knowledge to students about certain topics or show quick 
visuals.  Fundations kits including letter magnets and dry erase boards are used by teachers to review phonics 
concepts.  Teachers also utilize an array of guided reading books to teach reading skills at different levels.  Our school also 
utilizes Leveled Literacy Intervention materials to deliver reading instruction in small groups.                
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

We currently have a Freestanding ENL program and based on our parent surveys, a Bilingual or Dual Language program has not 
been created. The use of the Home language is encouraged for students who are new to this country.  Since we have a large 
population of students that are proficient ELLs, those students work with newly enrolled students to translate 
information.  Our newcomer ELL students are encouraged to write in their native language and translate it into English through 
the use of translators, a translation web site, or a bilingual dictionary.  In math, students and parents have access to translated 
materials.  We also have translated materials in Science.  Alternate placement para-professionals provide support to specific 
children in their home language throughout the day.  They can translate directions or concepts being discussed in the 
classroom.   Correspondence with parents is provided in their native language.  Our ENL room has a lending library with fiction 
and non fiction books in various languages.  Our school utilizes web based subscriptions to MYON which also provides students 
with the ability to read in their native language.  Additionally, our school website enables parent's to read about upcoming 
events in their native language.   
     
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services and resources correspond to the ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  This is ensured by utilizing the Common 
Core Standards and performance indicators.  The ENL teachers work alongside classroom teachers to provide service and 
resources that support and correspond to the child's specific grade level.  The ENL teachers are responsible for providing 
support for the ELLs to be successful within their classroom.  During ENL teacher team meetings, best practices and resources 
are shared.         
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school doesn't share a building.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our ENL teachers, with the help of the Parent Coordinator, work hard to assist newly enrolled ELLs with beginning their school 
year successfully.  Newly enrolled ELL students are introduced to the ELL teachers before beginning their school year.  The ELL 
teachers find a classmate of the newly enrolled ELL who can assist in translating if necessary.  Students are also given a 
welcome packet with activities to assist them at home.  Additionally newly enrolled ELLs are offered bilingual materials to 
assist in classroom tasks.  ENL teachers meet with parents of ELLs to discuss how the ENL program works at school and what 
they can do to help their child at home.  Parents are made aware of websites that may help their child learn some English 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

vocabulary.  Our school guidance counselors are also available if our newly enrolled ELLs have trouble transitioning into their 
new environment.  They host meetings with the students who may need extra support as they begin a new school, try to make 
new friends, and acclimate to their new surroundings.            
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently, there are no language electives offered.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have a dual language program at this time.  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The ENL teachers at our school attend numerous professional development workshops throughout the year.  They turnkey the 
professional development during a series of teacher workshops held on Monday afternoons.  Assistant Principals, common 
branch teachers, paraprofessionals, bilingual coordinators, ENL teachers, guidance counselors, special education teachers, 
secretaries, and parent coordinators are all invited to attend.   
This year’s workshops are: 
October 2017: Common Core Bilingual Progressions 
November 2017: Creating Formative ELL Assessment - Accessing Language Acquisition Continuum  
December 2017: Language Acquisition Continuum - Implementation and Scoring 
March 2018:  Language Acquisition Continuum - Data Analysis and Instructional Implications  
April  2018: Scaffolding Close Reading – Creating an Entry Point for ELLs 
May 2018: Vocabulary Acquisition for ELLs     
June 2018: Instructional Strategies for English Language Learners with Special Needs 
 
The ELL teachers have numerous opportunities for professional development in supporting ELLs as they engage in the common 
core learning standards.  They attend meetings at the district office led by the ELL compliance specialist or an instructional 
specialist.  In addition, the teachers attend workshops sponsored by the United Federation of Teachers, the network, and 
other schools.  These professional development sessions are on topics that include information about delivering common core-
aligned instruction.  Our teachers are also given the opportunity to attend professional development given by consultant from 
the Core Collaborative team.  Teachers are able to use strategies learned at these workshops, along with materials acquired 
within their classrooms.  Teachers of ELLs receive training on breaking down the Common Core Learning Standards and making 
them manageable for their students.  Teachers receive training in creating student friendly success criteria to help their ELLs 
know and understand what is expected of them.         
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The aforementioned after school workshops are offered to teachers to account for the 15% of total hours for ELL professional 
development.  The additional school level, network, UFT, and ELL liason meetings make up the 50% of total hours for our ENL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

teachers.  The training sessions assist teachers throughout the building in scaffolding and differentiating grade level work for 
their ELLs.  We intend for all staff members to be able to incorporate ELL strategies into their teaching.  Records are 
maintained in the school ELL compliance binder.  Agendas are kept on file in the binder, as well as attendance. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Throughout the school year our school provides for individual meetings with parents of ELLs.  In addition to our 2 parent 
teacher conference days we also have 2 additional parent teacher evening sessions, one in September and one in May to meet 
with ELL parents to discuss their students.  Our school also utilizes the Tuesday afternoon parent involvement time that we 
have been given.  During this time, ENL teachers meet with parents alongside classroom or content teachers, hold individual 
conferences, or make telephone calls to speak with parents or set up a face-to-face conferences.  At these meetings, we 
discuss goals, the language development progress, assessment results, and language development needs specific to their 
child.  Bilingual staff and the Translation and Interpretation Unit are utilized to ensure clarity and understanding.  We focus on 
building a collaboration with the parents and classroom teachers.  We strive to leave the parents with some useful tips on how 
they can also help at home.  We discuss their student's strengths and next steps for academic success.  As needed, translators 
are present to help the parents understand the information.  If a translator is not available in the building, we call the 
translation unit.        

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Our ELL parents are very involved in our school community.  Our ELL parents feel comfortable attending meetings or school 
events due to our large number of bilingual staff.  Our bilingual staff members make it easy for our parents to part pate in our 
school community.  Our school has a large, active Parent Teacher Association.  Our parent coordinator is effectively 
involves the parents of our ELL students in the PTA and serves as a translator during P.T.A. meetings.  Throughout the year, 
various agencies come to our school to provide our parents with information to help their children in terms of health and 
academics.  Adult English classes are also offered after school.  Curriculum conferences are held to inform parents of what 
their child is learning in school and parent meetings are held throughout the year to inform them of their student’s 
progress.  At all of these activities, translators are present to ensure that the parents understand the information.  In addition, 
parents are invited to visit the school and go into their child’s classroom during reading, writing, and math lessons.  Parents are 
also invited to our numerous school-wide family nights, student of the month celebrations, our annual staff vs. student 
basketball game, and annual dance festival.  All invitations for our school events and family nights are sent home in numerous 
translated versions and can be found on the school website in the parents’ native languages.  ENL teachers also use their 
Tuesday parent-engagement time to reach out to ELL parents.  The goal is to help the parents be aware of their child's 
progress and what they can work on at home.  All of these activities ensure that our ELL parents are involved in our school 
community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Paul Martuccio, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

In order to assess our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs, our school uses an array of 
methodologies. First and foremost, we utilize the ATS report RAPL. This document provides us with information 
regarding the parents' preferred language of communication both orally and written. Additionally, our team 
utilizes the Home Language Survey, student emergency contact cards, the school report card, parent 
coordinator’s survey, attendance in the ESL adult classes, a verbal survey of the staff, data provided by the ENL 
teacher, and the beginning of the year school survey. Interviews held between the ENL teachers and our parents 
are extremely helpful in determining language preference of the parent and updates can be made in ATS as 
necessary.  
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.
