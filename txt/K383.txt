Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission statement (which follows) demonstrates our belief in a strong academic and performing arts program: 

The Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented is dedicated to providing a rigorous instructional 
program that challenges students to set goals and to take responsibility for their learning. We believe that student 
achievement is predicated on high standards, a clearly defined and rigorous curriculum and a strong home-school 
connection. We believe that all students possess natural gifts and talents that enhance their intellectual capabilities. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

We want our students to be lifelong learners and achievers. We educate our students to become leaders, problem 
solves and critical thinkers.  

 

Our school is built upon years of visionary leadership, a dedicated teaching staff and strong parental involvement. Our 
students excel because of the vision, dedication and support. Our motto, “To Whom Much is Given, Much is 
Required”, is the basis for our beliefs and our achievements. 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented located in Bushwick, Brooklyn District 32 serves 953 
students in grades 5-8. We are a screened borough-wide middle school choice school resulting in a diverse ethnic and 
economic student body from a wide variety of school districts across Brooklyn and Queens. We serve general 
education; special education (self contained, ICT, SETSS) and English Language Learner students. As a school 
community, we recognize and celebrate our diversity through a curriculum that is challenging and encourages 
students to consider multiple perspectives; a robust elective program that invites curiosity and encourages 
exploration; special programs and performances held throughout the school year that celebrate diversity and 
recognize academic achievement.  

Our school’s strengths are many. First, we offer accelerated classes including honors classes in Math and ELA grades 
6-8; Regents classes in Living Environment, Earth Science and Algebra in Grade 8; two years of either French or 
Spanish resulting in students taking the Proficiency exam; and a High School Accredited English Language Arts class in 
Grade 8. Our Regents pass rates in 2017-2018 were 100% Our common core aligned, engaging, rigorous and coherent 
curricula was a noted as a celebration area and received Well Developed rating in our Quality Review.  

We consistently celebrate academic achievement through our school Honor Roll program and nationally recognized 
honor societies including National Junior Honor Society and Beta Honor Society. Student voice is valued and 
encouraged through the Student Government, Peer Mediation and Peer Mentoring program. As noted in our 2014-
2015 Quality Review, we are Well Developed in establishing a culture of High Expectations for our school community. 
One example of high expectations is that all 8th grade students are registered for the Specialized High School Exam. 
Each year we have students who are offered seats in Specialized High School programs such as Brooklyn Technical 
High School, Brooklyn Latin and Laguardia High School of the Arts. Additionally, our students are also enrolled in other 
competitive high school programs. 

In addition to high academic expectations, another school strength is our diverse elective program. Our students 
choose electives including: ballet, jazz, world dance, visual arts, chorus, drama, steel pan, medical studies, technology, 
African American studies and robotics. During school year 2016-2017, we received a grant to develop a hydroponics 
garden. Teachers were trained in the maintenance and curriculum for the garden. During school year 2018-2019, we 
will continue to offer Hydroponic gardening as an elective class.. We believe that a strong foundation in the arts and 
electives supports student academic achievement and therefore students are programmed for arts/elective classes 
five days a week. 

Several external partnerships support our academic and performing arts programs. Partnerships include but are not 
limited to: 

New York Junior Tennis League which runs a comprehensive after school program for grades 6-8; Urban Advantage 
which provides hands-on Science experiences for our students both in the classroom and Science oriented field trips 
and About the Swing program which partners professional jazz musicians with our major Steel Pan students. Brooklyn 
Technical High School Pipeline program which identifies high performing 6th grade students and offers summer 
courses and Specialized High School exam test prep at Brooklyn Tech during their 7th and 8th grade years. Students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

who have been enrolled in this program have qualified for seats in Brooklyn Technical H.S, Brooklyn Latin and High 
School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College. We are partnered with the Brain Power program which 
teaches students and staff strategies for positive socio-emotional interactions We participate in several NYC DOE 
initiative programs including Algebra for All, Computer Science for All, College Access for All, Specialized High School 
Test Prep Pilot Program and the Learning Partners Program. Additionally, students participate in extracurricular sports 
activities such as Flag Football, Cheerleading, Soccer, Mighty Milers program, the Green Team, Fitness Club and Boys 
and Girls Basketball. We also offer several off site experiences that extend and enrich our students educational 
experiences including an annual trip to Poconos Environmental Education Center and an International Trip. In past 
years students have travelled to Costa Rica, Canada, and Spain. 

Supporting our school community and working to increase school family collaboration is our Parent Teacher 
Association. Headed by a strong, active Executive Board, the PTA sponsors workshops and speakers and hosts events 
such as Potluck dinners, Family socials, Book Fairs and the 8 th grade Prom. Additionally, the PTA hosts a variety of 
speakers from the community to share information about their services to better support the needs of our parents. 
Our strong family and school partnerships were noted as an area of celebration in our most recent Quality Review. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

14% students with Disabilities. 5% are in self contained settings. 4% of our students are ENL learners. 66% of our 
students are economically disadvantaged. In terms of our students with disabilities the specific academic needs range 
from students reading several levels below proficiency and several grade levels below in Math proficiency. This year 
we have three students taking the New York State Alternate Assessment. We have 48 students who receive mandated 
counseling for emotional needs ranging from support with positive social interactions and anger management. Out of 
our 128 students with disabilities 49 are also English Language Learners. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As evidenced by the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the school made the most progress in the following areas of the 
Framework: 

 

Strong Family Community Ties: rating increased from 2016-2017 school year. This was the third year that we 
saw increases in this area of the framework which was a focus of the SLT work year to increase Parent 
Engagement and effective community collaboration. 

  Rigorous Instruction rating increased from 2016-17 school year. This is the result of the implementation of the 

CEP action plan and the careful tracking of progress towards meeting this CEP goal. 

As evidenced by the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the Areas of the Framework for Focus: 

 

Supportive Environment: although this area was not yet given a rating, preliminary data indicated this is an 
area of continued focus. For example, 61% of students reported positively that the school prevents bullying; 
38% of students report positively that their teachers support them when they are upset and only 55% of 
students reported positively that they feel it is important that they come to school year day. 

  Collaborative Teachers: this area was rated as exceeding target, however, there was an overall decrease in 

the framework score from the previous year. In particular, the area of Innovation and Collective Responsibility 
received 75% positive responses and Quality of Professional Development received 73% positive responses. 
This indicates that although teachers collaborate with each other the collaboration systems and protocols 
may not be effective to address teachers supporting each other to try new practices and strategies.

Math Periodic baseline exams administered in September 2018 and data analyzed to surface gaps in proportional 
reasoning in our targeted subgroup of school lowest third. 

After gaps are surfaced for subgroups, teachers will track student progress towards mastery of the gaps using daily 
formative assessments such as entrance tickets, exit tickets, individual student conferences and conference notes and 
data trackers. This data will be used to refine lessons and target instruction. Teachers will also use the Periodic 
assessment data available in School net to assign students online support activities or hard copy support activities in 
the classroom. 

 

For each unit of study in CMP3, teachers will administer summative unit instructional tasks to surface subgroup 
student mastery of proportional reasoning. Results of unit instructional task assessments will be analyzed to refine 
instruction for upcoming unit of study. There are 6 units of study in CMP3. 

 

Math Teacher Collaborative Teams will meet on a regular schedule to analyze Tasks and student work and refine 
instruction. Teacher teams will regularly assess student progress through the use of skills trackers in the classroom 
and data on School net to create formative assessments to address standards where students are below proficiency 
levels. 

 

In May 2019, Spring Periodic Benchmark will be administered to determine if goal was met. If data shows goal was 
not met for some students in the subgroup, teachers will target students who did not meet in May and June 2019 by 
using instructional materials on Schoolnet. Students in subgroup will have the opportunity to revise answers on 
Spring Periodic Benchmark to demonstrate proficiency. 

 

By February 2019, all Math teachers will have been observed 3 times and receive oral and written feedback from 
administrator. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. (e.g. Performance Series, January 
Regents, etc.) 
Periodic assesments including Fall baseline and Spring benchmark; daily formative assessments including entrance 
tickets, exit tickets, conference notes, data tracks, CMP3 and Go Math unit instructional tasks, Schoolnet 
assessments. ADVANCE teacher observation data 

 
Part 5c. In February 2019, review progress towards meeting the annual goal and make adjustments to the action 
plan, if applicable.

 

Students are excited to learn and actively engage in classrooms that are welcoming, safe, and orderly. 
Student-centered learning environments develop students who push and support each other, creating a 
collaborative and generous atmosphere in the classroom. The classroom must support the social and 
emotional growth of all students. 

  According to the Framework, Supportive environments are classrooms where students are actively engaged in 

student centered learning where students push and support each other creating a generous atmosphere in 
the classroom. A priority need is to teach students across classrooms and all areas of the school how to have 
positive peer interactions and therefore reducing bullying, harassment and intimidation incidents. 

  According to the Framework, Supportive environments must support the emotional growth of all students. A 

priority need to provide opportunities both in the classroom and through activities and guidance resources 
opportunities for students to grow socially and emotionally. 

  According to the Framework, Supportive environments are classrooms that are welcoming, safe and orderly. 
A priority need is to create welcoming classrooms where students know they receive personal attention and 
support.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

 

Based on 2017-2018 School Quality Guide score for Collaborative Teachers is Exceeding Target for three consecutive 
year. 

92% of teachers say that they talk with one another about instruction according to the School Quality Guide 2017-
2018. 

 

87% of teachers say that they design instructional programs such as lessons and units together. 

Needs 

Improve teacher feedback on student work including feedback given during conferences and on written work as per 
area of focus on 2014-2015 Quality Review and Principal Performance Review Report from June 2018. 

 

Improve school wide system of student portfolios so teachers, students and parents can better monitor and track 
student progress in student work products throughout the year. 

 

Improve Collaborative Teacher Team protocols across all school wide teams to increase reflective dialogue and 
collective responsibility as indicated by Teacher survey results on School Quality Guide 

 

 

Priority Needs 

Effective Collaborative Teachers, according to the Framework for Great Schools, provide high quality instruction to 
increase student achievement as measured by the NYS ELA and NYS Math exam. Currently, ELA proficiency is 66% and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          25 

 

Math proficiency is 46%. To do this, Collaborative Teacher teams will focus their work on aligning assessments to 
curriculum and using assessment results to refine curriculum as noted on QR 2014-2015 report for indicator 2.2

classroom writing celebrations, District 32 School Fair, and 
Curriculum Night. 

 

Parent Engagement opportunities such as STEM night, Family 
Night, Social Studies Fair, Science Fair and Winter and Spring 
Concerts and International Weekend provide opportunities for 
student involvement. Students with ENL and SWD will have the 
opportunities to create hands-on projects, participate in 
workshops and practice and perform on stage. These 
opportunities provide support for confidence building and 
positive peer to peer and socialization 

Workshops for parents on topics that will increase school family 
partnerships including: Understanding Common Core Standards; 
ESL classes for adults; GED classes for adults, Technology 
workshops for parents; Bullying prevention and safe Internet 
usage; Celebrating Cultural Diversity (International Day), 
Effective Communication with your Teen on understanding 
matters related to the LGBTQ community and puberty. 
Workshops to promote financial literacy and civic involvement 
including "Saving for your Child's College Education" and 
Passport Day. Workshops to increase male role model in 
community such as "My Greatest Guy" initiative 

 

These workshops will support the ENL and SWD students 
because parents will learn strategies to assist their students both 
at home and in school.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met.

2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented IS 383, in 
compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for 
creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student 
achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by 
actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are 
encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee 
as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

 

Philippa Schuyler Middle School for the Gifted and Talented IS 383 will support parents and families of Title I 
students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress;

outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress;

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Direct instruction supplemental program will consist of an after school program to support the 38 
ELL students currently at Philippa Schuyler Middle School and the anticipated incoming ELLs 
for the 2018-19 school year.  The after school program will provide targeted instruction focusing 
on literacy and math skills.  Our school data indicates that our ELL average proficiency on NYS 
ELA is 2.33. The complete data from the 2017-2018 state exams is not available yet. However, 
according to the cut list, 47% of our ELLs passed the ELA exam and 64% passed the math 
exam.  Of the 38 returning ELLs, 37 are also Special Education students ranging from grades 6-
8.  19 of our ELL students are in a 12:1:1 special education setting. Our NYSESLAT data from 
2017 shows that reading and writing are areas of concern for our students. We will use the data 
from the NYSESLAT proficiency levels to differentiate instruction (listening/speaking and 
reading/writing) in order to meet the targeted needs of our ELL population which includes a 
significant number of special education students. We will provide the following after school 
program. To develop our students, the after school program will take place two times a week 
from 3:00PM-4:30PM-Wednesday and Thursdays starting October 10th through Thursday, April 
18th (for total of 50 sessions). The program will consist of 4 teachers (2 content and 2 ESL) and 
will be overseen by 1 supervisor. The teachers will be team teaching.  Please note that our school 
does not have any after school programs and in order to ensure a safe and secure learning 
environment, a supervisor is needed.  The supervisor's regular work hours are from  8:00AM-
4:00PM and the after school program will end at 4:30.  We have included 1 hour per session for 
the supervisor, per week to oversee the after school program.  Our after school program will 
develop literacy and math skills through project-based learning that incorporates ENL strategies. 
       In order to achieve college and career readiness English Language learners at Philippa 
Schuyler are held to the grade level Common Core State Standards. Despite each student’s 
individual academic standing, it is expected that students will be able to meet grade level 
achievement. Therefore, students will receive instruction which focuses on expanding their 
literary and mathematical skills. Instructional materials will be solely be used for after 
school.   Advancement towards grade level achievement will be made through multi-modal 
targeted instruction which focuses on listening, speaking, reading and writing. Multi-modal texts 
are those in which meaning is conveyed through written, oral, visual, auditory, tactile, gesture, or 
spatial representations. Research shows that such texts can help bridge the gap between students’ 
knowledge and experience and their expression of that knowledge. In particular, we plan to use 
digital stories and digital journals to scaffold the writing process and help students write personal 
narratives and persuasive essays.  In general, greater incorporation of multi-modal texts will also 
help students learn to see their own experiences, cultural heritage, language, and community as 
both worthy of celebration and as resources on which to draw to deepen their understanding of 
content. Many of our students are visual and tactile learners and incorporating more targeted 
project based instruction would help them make more meaningful connections to the content and 
make grade-level content accessible. Furthermore, such projects will strengthen student 
engagement and family/community involvement in the school as we develop student literacy 
through investigation of their own communities, experiences, and areas of interest.  Additional

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
support will be provided to our ENL students through the use of sentence starters, Total Physical 
Response, visuals, relia, word-to-word dictionaries, literature in their home language, and both 
grade-level literature and literature adapted to meet the reading levels and English language 
proficiency. These scaffolds will make content comprehensible, aid students in acquiring higher-
order comprehension skills and developing literacy skills across content areas. 
      Finally, the program will advance student achievement by providing a safe and productive 
environment in which students can receive the targeted and effective support. In order to do this, 
the class size of each after school session will be capped at 20 students. The program will utilize 
a co-teaching model in which each session is taught by an ENL and content teacher. In addition, 
ample time will be provided for teachers to attend professional development and plan researched 
based instruction. 
Budget for the Title III program totals $12,366.  The monies will be used to fund an after school 
program for the ELL students.  The program will run for 40 weeks every Wednesday and 
Thursday from 2:40-4:30.  There will be 1 supervisor, 2 Content teachers (ELA and Math) and 2 
ELL teachers.  We will use instructional materials from Rally, Continental Press and 
Pearson.  Supervisor per session totals $2,820.  Teacher per session totals 8,008.  Supplies will 
total 1,538.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our school has started to use the Teacher's College reading and writing workshop curriculum. Within this model, there are 
many summative and formative assessments that are implemented to guide instructional planning for our English Language 
Learners. This curriculum calls for a pre and a post assessment of every unit. The data from the pre-assessment is used to 
identify students that are struggling in a variety of areas such as annotating. This allows the teacher to select the appropriate 
mid-conference workshops and group students in accordance to the skills that they need to work on. The post assessment 
allows the teacher to monitor the progress that the students have made as the relate to the common core standards. Thus, 
demonstrating which skills need to be revisited. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

During the 2017-2018 school year there will be a TC coach named Dwight McCaulsky. He will be partnering with our ENL 
teacher to modify the curriculum to be beneficial to our students.  Mr. McCaulsky and our ENL teacher will turnkey their 
findings to the ELA departmentt so the skills, and tools can used and further developed in the content area class. Mr. 
McCaulsky will be providing and leading professional development workshops with the ELA department and our ENL teacher 
to assist them in implementing this curriculum and analyzing the assessment data. Our ENL teacher will be attending to 
conferences at Teacher's College to receive support of ENL strategies that coincide with the Teacher's College Reading and 
Writing curricula.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Our teacher administers the ELL Periodic Assessment in the Fall and Spring to guide instructional planning for our ELLS. These 
assignments are designed to measure student progress in their English language Proficiency and to predict performance on the 
New York State English Language Acquisition Assessment. The results provide our teacher with detailed information about our 
students' strengths and weakness in the English Language development and serve as a resource to help her plan individual and 
group instruction. On Schoolnet, the ENL teacher will be able to have the see which students struggled with the various 
common core learning standards and which standards the students were successful.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In October of 2016 and April of 2017 the bench mark test was administered. The data revealed that the students are struggling 
in the following areas: literacy, writing and listening. The ENL teacher and content area teacher will be meeting on a weekly 
basis to plan instruction that will use engaging texts that students will be able to discuss to build both conversation and 
academic language and knowledge. Students will be involved in writing activities where they can build language and 
knowledge. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
At this time, there are no fifth graders in ENL. However, in the event we have 5th grade ELLs, the 5th grade teachers, ENL 
teacher, Assistant Principal in charge of 5th grade, Assistant Principal in charge of ENL, Assistant Principal in charge of SWDs, 
IEP coordinator, and programmer will meet to ensure that the students are placed within the correct tier. Based upon the tier 
the child is in, s/he will receive the appropriate scaffolds. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
When the teachers are allowed to return to the building, the ENL teacher, will receive a copy of the RLAT report and compile 
the data. This data will include the students Math score, ELA score, their current ENL Level, and the raw score for each 
receptive and expressive form of communication.  The teacher will create a comparative graph to show how the students are 
trending. The administrative team, ENL teacher and programmer will meet to evaluate the ELL program based upon the data.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In September our ENL teacher, will conduct a brief meeting with the faculty to share the data. This will enable all staff to 
appropriately plan their instruction. The information will also be available to them via a shared OneDrive document.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

All the students that are in our building are graded. In the 5th and 6th grade, the students travel in consistent groups 
to all of their content area classes. Therefore, the ELLs are grouped into the appropriate class; ICT, General Education 
or self-contained. This allows the ENL teacher to travel to the students English Language Arts class.  For the 7th and 
8th grade the ELLs students will be grouped into the appropriate ELA class to ensure that they are getting the correct 
service and being serviced for the appropriate time allotment. All freestanding ENL classes will have no more than 2 
consecutive grades of students of a similar level. The school has recently implemented the use of the Teacher's 
College Reading and Writing Program. The curricula will be supplemented with teacher made materials, routines from 
Ricthhart and Church's book Making Thinking Visible and rigorous classroom conversation. Additionally, all 
accommodations in students IEPs will be accounted for in the instruction.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

     Prior to scheduling students, the school's programmer, the Assistant Principal of ELLs, the Assistant Principal of Special 
Education and the ENL teacher meet to review the data for the 5 proficiency level of ELLs. The students who tested on the 
entering and emerging will be placed in the same ELA class to ensure that they receive the 180 minutes of integrated ENL/ELA 
service. They will also be programmed for 180 minutes of Stand Alone service in lieu of one of their electives to ensure that 
they receive the appropriate number minutes in a Stand Alone setting. The transitioning students will be pulled out of an 
elective in order to receive .5 units of flexibility in services. The ENL teacher will spend 3 days a week in an integrated ENL/ELA 
class for the transitioning students; the remaining two days the ENL teacher will be in an integrated ENL/content area class for 
the commanding students. All commanding students will be scheduled in one content area class in common. All expanding 
students will have their ELA class in common, thus allowing the ENL teacher to visit their ELA class on a daily basis. The 
determination of units are specified in chart 5.1.       
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All content is delivered in English. The content area teacher will provide specific materials and lessons which will be 
supplemented with additional scaffolds by the ENL teacher. The core content area teachers will utilize the Hallmarks of 
Advance Literacy. This approach to literacy will include the use of engaging texts that feature big ideas and rich content. 
Students will talk and discuss in both conversational language and academic language.  They will write and build language and 
knowledge of the content and study a small set of high utility vocabulary words to build a depth of knowledge.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   ELL students have the option to take the state assessments in their home language.

SIFE – In the beginning of the academic year,  the SIFE students will be identified to all content area teachers, in addition, to 
the grade that their formal education started in the United States. Teachers will use conferencing and mid workshop 
interruptions to target the standards from the previous grade levels which were completed in the home country.   
New comer –  At the moment, we do not have newcomer ELLs. However, in the event that a newcomer enrolls, we will first 
assess their proficiency and literacy in the home language. Once proficiency is determined, we would guide the parent through 
the different programs available for newcomer.  
Developing – Developing ELLs will be provided with tools and scaffolds such as tiered vocabulary and shades of meaning to 
help increase their vocabulary. The ENL teacher will meet with the content area teachers to discuss the scaffolding and 
additional resources that can be used.  
Long term – Long term ELLs will receive a language objective and a content area objective in all content area classes.  The ENL 
teacher will meet with the content area teachers to discuss the scaffolding and additional resources that can be used.  
Former – Former ELLs will be provided with 90 minutes of instructional support in content area classes.  The ENL teacher will 
meet with the content area teachers to discuss the scaffolding and additional resources that can be used. ELLs and Former 
ELLs will receive testing accommodations that will include the use of extended time and the use of a content area thesaurus in 
their home language.   
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELL-SWDs are given additional time to cover the same academic material that is being covered in the general education classes 
with additional scaffolds and resources. Grade level materials will include engaging texts, rich discussion, daily writing, and the 
use of high utility words. In addition, the ELLs will have access to computers; giving them access to writing software and 
internet capability. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
All students have an annual IEP meeting in which all content area teachers, service providers, counselors and ENL teachers 
provide individualized SMART goals. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The NJHS provide extra help and tutoring services. ELL students are invited and encouraged to attend tutoring specifically 
created for the NYS examinations (ELA and mathematics). Additionally, there is tutoring provided for social studies and 
science. The students can enroll un the New York Junior Tennis League which provides academic tutorials and the ability of 
ELLs to grow their social interactions. The school will provide an after school tutoring program focusing on literary skills.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

It was noted on the previous LAP,  our school started to implement the Teacher's College writing program. Based upon the 
success in our school of this program, we have implemented the Teacher's College Readers' Workshop reading program.  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Our bilingual program was closed in 2005 due to low enrollment. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs have equal access to all programs offered during and after school. During the school day, ELLs participate in the same 
robust electives program offered to all students. The school offers electives in visual arts, dance, drama, robotics, medical 
studies, steel pan, drama, hydroponics, chorus, African American Studies, French, and Spanish.  All students, including all 
ELLs and students with IEPs, may apply to any after school program offered.  All students can enroll in our ELA, math and 
SHSAT test preparation after school programs. All students can enroll in the New York Junior Tennis League (SONIC) after 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

school program, which provides enrichment activities to students, such as film, dance, tennis, and other sports. We also offer a 
Title 3 funded after school program specifically designed to improve the academic language, literacy, and math skills of our 
ELLs.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our school currently utilizes Teacher's College Reading and Writing, Achieve 3000, CMP3, Scope and sequence for both social 
studies and science for content area instruction. All classroom teachers have a laptop, document camera and projector that 
can be utilized during their lessons.   
. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is provided in the classrooms and during testing. All students are provided with classroom resources, 
such as dictionaries, thesauruses, and literature and informational texts in the home language. In addition, many of the 
assigned teachers and para-professionals are bilingual, hence supporting the verbal language in the classroom.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

SESIS data is routinely monitored by the assistant principal. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We are a campus school, that shares a cafeteria and gymnasium with the charter school housed in our building. The Building 
Council meets on a monthly basis to determine how the shared space is to be utilized. The shared Space Committee which is 
comprised of faculty and parents meet four times annually where they are briefed on the council's determination. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The guidance counselor, Ms. Freire, meets routinely with ELLs to monitor their social and emotional transition into middle 
school. One the first day of school she gives them a tour of the building and has a meet and greet session with their teachers.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Languages Other Than English is offered to all students in grade 7 and 8. Our school has teachers for the Spanish Language

how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All teachers are encouraged to attend in-house, district and city professional development focusing on ELLs and ENL strategies. 
The teachers will receive information about workshops offered by the office of DELLs. The school will provide a monthly 
professional development workshop that will focus on ELL students, ENL strategies, language acquisition, including a focus on 
best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. Teachers will be provided 
with additional literature to assist in ENL strategies.  Teachers will be responsible for submitting their professional 
development hours every five years to the personnel secretary.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Workshops will be provided for parents in order to understand Part 154 and how they can support their student's academic 
success.  One day month at 3:00PM we will host ESL workshop for parents.  The workshops will be facilitated by school staff 
including Assistant Principal in charge of ESL services; ESL teachers; Parent Coordinator and Bilingual Guidance Counselor. The 
workshops will be held November 27, December 11, February 5, and March 5.  The workshops will be one hour comprehensive

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Data concerning language preferences of the families that make up our school community is gathered from the 
HLIS, ATS Report and Blue Emergency Contact cards. The data identifies the language preferred by the families to 
communicate via writing and phone. 
 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language
