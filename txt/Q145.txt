Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We will create a community of active 21st Century Learners through equitable opportunities for critical thinking, 
collaboration, communication and creativity. Our diverse staff, parents and student body will spearhead initiatives 
to advocate for a safe, efficient, and effective learning environment for all. We will work alongside our community 
to lead our students to academic, social and emotional excellence.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

I.S. 145Q has 1700 students, grades 6-8. Of this total, 9% are Asian, 2% Black, 87% Hispanic, and 2% White. Of this 
total 21% are English Language Learners, and 17% are Students with Special Needs. 24% of our ENL population is also 
identified as Students with Disabilities. Our student attendance rate is 95% and teacher attendance rate is 96%, which 
is a strength of ours based upon a school of our size. The students enjoy attending 145Q, particularly due to the 
academy concept we offer, providing the students with a better sense of belonging and connectedness to the school. 
We offer four (4) themed academies: Enterprise, Discovery, Explorer and Global, aligned to our Magnet Grant Goals. 
Each academy has a stable leadership team comprised of an assistant principal, adviser/dean and guidance counselor 
dedicated to serving the needs of the students within the respective academy. Although each academy offers the 
state-mandated courses, our Global Academy is unique in that it offers the distinguished Dual Language program, a 
bilingual program, SIFE and an ESL program to meet the needs of the students in our diverse community of Jackson 
Heights, New York. 

We face many challenges due to our school size and diverse population; including the fact that we are a Title I school, 
with 80% of our students designated for free lunch. We have organized our large school into smaller, more 
manageable academies. We have been a one session school since 2017-18 school year. This has impacted our PD 
program as our teachers now have the opportunity to meet weekly as a school community. 

 

We have developed a plan and implemented systems (teacher collaboration via PLC, inter-visitation protocols, 
teacher leaders, UFT Teacher Center) to ensure that we meet City and State Instructional Expectations. These 
implementations and plans amongst others have led our school to achieve a Good Standing Status for two 
consecutive school years. In addition, we met targets in Student Progress, Student Achievement, School Environment 
and Closing the Achievement Gap. We increased our ELA performance with a +11% increase in level 3+4's in 2016-17 
and an additional 5% in 2017-18; we also improved wth a 1% increase in level 3 + 4 in mathematics in 2016-2017 and 
an additional 8% increase in 2017-2018. 

Our academic program meets the academic needs of our middle school, grades 6-8. We provide the mandated 
curriculum in addition to advanced courses where students can earn high school credit at the middle school level. 
These Regents courses include Algebra 1, Living Environment and Earth Science, offered at the 8th grade level. These 
students take the 8th grade state exam in addition to the Regents exam for high school credit demonstrating 
proficiency at the 8th grade level and beyond. We also provide the Spanish Proficiency exam to our 8th graders so 
that they can fulfill this academic requirement while still at the middle school. In this way, we are doing what we can 
at the middle school level to ensure college and career readiness from this phase of their lives.`8 

This will be our third school year as a Federally Awarded Magnet School. Within this STEM Grant our school has added 
multiple programs to develop and enhance programs offered within the areas of science, technology, engineering, art 
and mathematics. A team of Magnet Specialists oversees the implementation of the grant ensuring the fidelity of the 
grant's expectations. This federally funded grant has been given to us so that we can install programs that will attract 
a more diverse population to our school. 

In response to our diverse community and student population, and its unique size, we have endeavored to form 
partnerships with many organizations to further provide support and stimulation for intellectual, emotional and social 
growth:

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

I.S. 145 has 340 ENLs of which 116 (20%) are considered Long-Term ENLs. They are allocated as follows: (15% in the 
6th grade; 40% in the 7th grade; and 45% in the 8th grade). Although our largest numbers are in the 8th grade, that is 
our also our largest grade-sized population by far. 21 % of our student population have IEPs. 24% of the Long Term 
ELLs have I.E.Ps and are placed either in Self-Contained, ICT settings or related services. These students receive 
STAND-ALONE E.S.L services by a licensed ESL teacher. In streamlining the different sources of formative and 
summative assessments (State exams, Subject area Core Tests, Student portfolios, MYON Reading Program), Long-
Term ELLs underperformed in comparison to our school’s non-ELLs as follows: In the area of Mathematics, they 
showed deficiencies in: (a) multi-steps word problem equations; (b) Short and extended responses in Geometry and

Algebra. Based on the NYSESLAT and the ELA State Exam this population scored lower than the other subgroups in 
writing.  

As evidenced by our progress in reducing the number of long-term ELLs each year, our students are improving their 
skills and proficiency levels displaying the academic and personal behaviors needed to sustain educational and 
personal growth: persistence, engagement, work habits/ organizational skills, communication/collaboration skills and 
self-regulation: 

• Students set monthly academic goals thereby showing persistence and self-efficacy.  

• We help ensure that students have opportunities for social-emotional connections within the school throughout the 
year. This occurs through the academy model, clubs, after-school programs, trips, community service and our Student 
G.O., etc. 

• Within our academic disciplines and support services, teachers seek to develop organizational skills and infuse good 
work habits within our students. 

• Our school strives to foster confidence, a sense of self-worth and the ability to problem solve and self-regulate 
within our students. Peer mediation, student government, academy ambassadors, GO Reps, class/group monitors are 
all examples of students being leaders and autonomous in ensuring they have a means of self-regulating and 
collaboratively working challenges out with their peers. 

 

I.S. 145 also has a 50-50 Dual Language Program in grades 6th through 8th. This program has expanded with the 
additional of a third dual language class in both the 6th and 7th grades. Next year we will have it at all three grade 
levels and we will increase the number of these sections that take Algebra I and Living Environment, two HS regents 
classes. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Based on the 2017 - 2018 School Survey Response, I.S. 145 has made the most progress in rigorous instruction, which 
reflects the 93% of students that say that they are learning a lot to prepare them for high school. In one year we also 
increased from 73% to 81% in the percentage of teachers that say student show that they respect each other's ideas. 
There was an increase from 79% to 86% in teachers stating that they had opportunities to work productively with 
colleagues at the school on professional development.  

Our key areas of focus for the upcoming 2018-2019 school year will be students feeling challenged in their classes, 
which is measured in the key area of focus in rigorous instruction. As evidenced in the survey response, only 67% of 
students say that they are challenged in their classes and only 62% of students say that teachers ask difficult 
questions in class. For this reason we have increased the number of dual language classes as well as the expectations 
for the number of classes taking the Spanish Proficiency exam. We are notifying 7th grade math teachers that the 
expectation is that more 8th grade classes will be taking the Algebra I course and Regents exam in 2019-2020.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

1. 

 Our strengths based on the data from the ELA and Math 2017-2018 state exams, the students are performing 
at a 36 % Level 3-4 in ELA and 30% Level 3-4 in Mathematics. The needs in ELA based on these results are that 
Students with Disabilities (SWD) and Limited English Proficiency (LEP) are in need of additional supports. LEP 
students are in need of supports for Mathematics as well.  

 Based on the School Quality Guide, Relative to Rigorous Instruction, our strengths are that 93% of students say that 
they are learning a lot in their classes to prepare them for the next level or grade. Also, 93% of teachers of all subjects 
say that they had the resources for students to interact with academic language. 98% of Math/Science teachers say 
that they had the resources to focus deeply on the concepts emphasized in the standards to help students build 
strong foundations of learning.  

 

2. Based upon the School Quality Guide Results, our areas of need where identified as follows: 67% of the students 
responded that they feel challenged in class and 62% felt that in most or all of the classes, their teachers asked 
difficult questions in class. 68% of teachers said that the students build on each others ideas during class discussion. 
This can be correlated to the lowest rating for teachers on the Advance ratings which show that teachers at our school 
is 3b, questioning and discussion techniques and 3d, using assessment in instruction. Thus teachers need professional 
learning in Domain 3b, Questioning and Discussion Techniques and 3d, using assessment in instruction. And students 
will engage in thorough exploration of a concept by creating and posing questions and engage in high quality 
discussions.  

 

3. With a focus on Rigorous Instruction, I.S.145 has an ongoing relationship consisting of the Instructional Cabinet 
with members including the Administration, UFT Teacher Center Representative, the school Data Specialist, and the 
Teacher Leadership Team. Trust is established and maintained through the teachers and administration working 
collaboratively to target the needs of the students. Teachers routinely perform inter-visitation of model teachers 
classrooms, and Highly Effective rated teachers to share best practices, and conduct lab classroom settings.

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, the ELA teachers will work together to further enhance the Expeditionary Learning units with Literacy and 
Project-Based Learning performance tasks focusing on questioning and discussion techniques in order to achieve a 4% 
increase on student growth on the ELA state exam.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
We have many strengths relative to Supportive Environment: Our students feel supported in terms of guidance, that 
they feel safe in their classroom and that they are taught how to critically think. As evidenced by the School Quality 
Guide: 93% of our students feel that their school provides guidance for the application of high school, 93% of students 
say they feel safe in their classes and 90% of teachers say adults at their school teach critical thinking at their school. 
Our greatest progress was made in the Social Emotional, 88% of teachers say that adults at their school help students 
develop skills they need to complete challenging coursework despite obstacles.  

Our areas of need is to improve teacher and student relationships, including our students feeling that they are 
supported by adults and listening to instructions. This need is grounded in the Quality Guide Survey which reported 
that, 65% of students say that most students listen carefully when the teacher gives direction. This can be correlated 
to the fact that only 54% of students feel teachers support them when they are upset, which research proves to have 
a direct relationship between doing well in school.  

Current practices in place are classrooms with clear routines and expectations for the workshop model. Teachers and 
administration greet students in the morning and before classes to establish trust and collaboration. During transition 
periods teachers are encouraged to proctor the hallways to ensure students arrive to class on time. Safety officers 
make daily rounds on each floor during class time to ensure all students are in class. Students can see their school 
counselors for emotional support. In addition, we have a mental clinic, nurses, and a counseling center on site. As a 
structure, we have moved from a multi-session school to a single session school. This allows for after school 
programming to address the needs of the student. It allows for weekly after school sessions for parent outreach. Also, 
the Wellness Center and having a guidance counselor in each academy provides emotional and personalized academic 
guidance. Being a four academy school, allows for small teaching teams, and small learning communities that build 
strong relationships with students and family.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, all instructional staff will collaboratively maintain an empathetic classroom and providing multiple 
opportunities for students to succeed which will reduce the number of students referred to the Dean for disruptive 
behavior.

Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) a 
framework for maximizing the selection use of evidence based 
prevention and intervention that support academic, social, 
emotional and behavioral competence of all students. I.S. 145 
will use this framework building wide, with practices such as the 
use of "Lion Bucks" as a rewards for positive behavior and 
academic achievement. Counselors for School will provide 
emotional support for students. Behavior Intervention Plans 
(BIP) will be used for at risk students to monitor behavior of 
Special Education students. For English Language Learners, 
bilingual staff will support the needs of these students and 
promote value of cultural awareness. 

Model Teacher, Peer Collaborative Teacher, and volunteer 
classrooms will be offered as a lab to model best practices for 
PBIS interventions in classroom inter-visitations and sharing. 
Inter-visitation opportunities will be regularly provided in 
classrooms throughout the school community. A schedule of 
open classrooms will be sent out on a weekly basis to the entire 
staff offering teachers with a menu of classrooms to visit.  

The PD committee, instructional team members,teachers and 
guidance counselors will plan and deliver differentiated PD on 
creating an Empathetic Classroom and de-escalation techniques. 
PD will be provided on how to implement the Prevent Teach

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the School Quality Guide 2017-18, our areas of strength relative to Collaborative Teachers are that:  

93% percent of teachers say that they talk with one another about instruction. 95% of teachers say they modify 
instructional activities and materials to meet the development needs and learning interests of all their students. 95% 
of students say that their teachers respect their culture or background.  

Our priority needs relative to Collaborative Teachers are: 

72% of teachers say that other teachers help maintain discipline in the whole school and not just their classrooms. 
72% of teachers say that their professional development experiences this year have included enough time to think 
carefully about, try, and evaluate new ideas.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 5% increase, as measured by the 2018-19 School Quality Guide, in the teacher's perception 
that other teachers help maintain discipline in the whole school and not just their classrooms and teacher's perception 
that their professional development experiences this year have included enough time to think carefully about, try, and 
evaluate new ideas.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

PBIS will be implemented school-wide to improve social, 
emotional and academic outcomes for all students, including 
students with disabilities and students from underrepresented 
groups. To support implementation, PD will be offered to all staff 
members, including non-teaching staff such as school aides and 
cafeteria staff. All staff will use uniform preventative and 
responsive approaches as well as reward systems for behavior 
both in and out of the classroom.  

The PD committee, instructional team members will use teacher 
needs assessment in the beginning of 2018-19 school year to 
plan PD calendar. Each PD will be facilitated in 3 separate 
sessions, allowing teacher time to think, try, and evaluate new 
learning strategies. Feedback surveys will be administered at the 
end of each PD round and be used to inform future professional 
learning opportunities for staff and implementation.  

Following professional development, Model Teacher, Peer 
Collaborative Teacher, and volunteer classrooms will be offered 
as a lab to model instructional practices taught at PD. Inter-
visitation opportunities will be regularly provided in classrooms 
throughout the school community and will be followed up with 
some form of debrief, eg: digital, whole group or one to one.  

Administration will use classroom observations and data from 
Advance as opportunities to see implementation of learned 
strategies, teacher growth, changing teacher needs throughout 
the year and engage in solutions based discussions.

Part 5a. Schools are expected to engage in progress monitoring as part of an overall cycle of continuous improvement 
planning. Identify a mid-point benchmark(s) that will indicate school progress toward meeting the specified goal. 
If we progress monitor with the following mid-point benchmarks:  

 

In January then again in May of 2019, we will monitor our progress to see: how many student trips have been 
conducted, how many parents have chaperoned them, our progress on the number of college visits that have 
been made, the number of parents who have attended, the number of parent workshops that have been 
offered and the number of attendees.  

  We will conduct surveys in relation to these to monitor progress we're making in the parents' estimation.  

Then by the end of June 2019, there will be a 10% increase in each of the following areas on the 2018-19 School 
Quality Guide: parents' perception that they have had the opportunity to volunteer time to support school and 
students perception that there is at least one adult in the school that they can confide in. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
The Principal will meet with teachers that are out of license, by December 2018, in order to assist them in preparing a 
plan to become highly qualified in their subject area. At 145Q we utilize a variety of methods to ensure we recruit and 
hire the best possible candidates to staff our school. We canvas not only the city pool, attend hiring fairs, review 
applicants’ referrals and resumes but also solicit candidates from the suburbs and local colleges. 

In our efforts to retain highly qualified teachers and ensure they have the supports and strategies to grow 
professionally, we are highly invested in professional development. We offer professional development to teachers 
on best teaching practices provided by other teachers, administrators and consultants. Mentoring is implemented as 
per teacher requirements. We are also fortunate to have Teacher Leaders on staff that support teacher learning 
through Lab classrooms and one to one coaching. They receive training, conduct professional development, provide 
mentoring and maintain an open classroom for all to inter-class visit to see best practices in action. 

We believe individualized professional development plans are designed to focus on each teacher’s needs. Teachers 
are active participants in the process and collaborate with administrators to review their goals and monitor progress 
and development. Each teacher will develop an Individual Improvement Plan (IIP) mainly to move teachers toward 
highly-effective practice. The Danielson's Framework for Teacher Effectiveness (2013) will be used as a professional 
course of study. Teachers self-assess on a regular basis and confer with school leaders. 

'  

All professional development is research and evidence based. Research Based Strategies (RBIs) are emphasized in our 
trainings. Inter-visitations are encouraged for all teachers as well as participation in external professional 
development opportunities. Teachers are expected to complete an inter-visitation form each time they complete a 
visit and reflect upon practices observed they feel they can now implement within their own classrooms. Our network 
specialists support teacher retention by providing on-site trainings, modeling, and teacher team development.  

We are committed to ensure that teachers have the resources and support needed to succeed. Additionally, we will 
continue to fund our UFT Teacher Center so that teachers have professional development opportunities and a space 
for collaboration We encourage celebrations of success and sharing.

At 145Q, Joseph Pulitzer, a MOSL Committee was formed to review whether or not we would utilize the MOSL 
assessment, which assessment measures would be most beneficial for our teachers and students, and how we could 
best utilize the assessments and the scores to inform instruction. The Committee comprised of both teachers and 
administrators, including the principal, ultimately did decide to utilize the MOSL assessments across the four major 
subjects in each grade, ELA, SOCIAL STUDIES and SCIENCE and MATHEMATICS. Teachers received professional 
development to norm the rubric, arranged for scoring partners and scored the exams. Their findings, gauging student 
strengths and weaknesses were shared horizontally and vertically and a plan of action to address these skills was 
implemented by department. Professional Development will be conducted to ensure the identified deficient/ weak 
skill sets will be addressed. The Math Department has collectively agreed to generate baseline, mid-year, and end of 
year, benchmarks in Math through Schoolnet to assess student progress in mathematics. These benchmark 
assessments are fully aligned to the CCLS. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Joseph Pulitzer Intermediate School 145, in compliance with the Section 1118 
of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Joseph Pulitzer Intermediate School 145 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Begin description here:            
There will be two cohorts of ENLs from grades 6th - 8th  participating in the After School 
Program.  Some of these students will be taking the ELA exam for the first time (Subgroup One) 
while others will be taking the test for a second time (Subgroup two). There will be ample 
emphasis on a variety of non-fiction literature so we can expose students to diverse topics across 
all content areas. In addition, students will receive instruction in math via project-based and 
applied learning. Instruction will be conducted in English by three certified ENL teachers and 
three certified Math teachers that will scaffold using  ENL methodologies to facilitate content 
and language learning. The program will run from October 2018 to April 2019, and will 
be meeting twice a week after school, Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 2:20 - 4:20 with six 
teachers. Teachers will be using the Myon Computer-based reading program to supplement 
classroom instruction, allowing them to access both fiction and non-fiction books. Math teachers 
will be supplementing and enhancing the CMP3 Curriculum with  resources from GO 
Math  series. There will be an emphasis on problem solving and writing reflections to help 
students apply content learned to everyday life situations. In addition, teachers will facilitate 
learning by helping students apply content learned via different rigorous and challenging inquiry-
based projects. 
The subgroups of students to be served will be the newcomers and Expanding  ENLs from 
grades 6th, 7th and 8th. Parents and students will have access to a computer based program 
(Myon) in English and Spanish. They will be supported by a bilingual and multicultural staff. 
Content will be scaffolded to support different home language literacy levels via the use of 
images, audio, video, translation. Students will use Google tools to create a digital portfolio. In 
addition student will also engage in project based learning to create and present a culminating 
project. 
Each teacher will be responsible for taking and keeping attendance and performance records. 
They will also be responsible for contacting the parent to communicate the students' progress. If 
translation is needed, the teacher is responsible for finding a bilingual staff member or using the 
DOE's translation services to communicate with the parent.  
Daily attendance will be maintained by every teacher to ensure continues participation. Copies of 
information sent home will also be kept on file. Information will be sent home in English and 
Spanish. We will accommodate translation to other languages as needed.   
Materials will be supplemental. Teachers will use resources such as Myon Reading and 
discussion protocols and techniques to develop language, content and thinking skills.

Writing component) to meet the needs of Transitioning, Expanding, Emerging ENLs . Project-
based learning will be infused in all these training sessions. 
During these trainings we will focus on the following topics:  Using formative and Summative 
Assessments, Effective Teaching and Instructional Strategies for ENLs,  and Strategic Reading 
for ENLs. Most of the time will be devoted to aligning the Curriculum maps for all content areas 
and infusing project-based learning across all content areas. 
The following teacher leaders: Ms. Samantha Chung, Jerry Tanaka, Cecilia Delgado will provide 
PD to ENL and Bilingual Content Area Teachers. PD providers will focus on engaging students 
in meaningful discussion to develop literacy across all content areas.  
The PD will help ELLs use discussion protocols and  questioning techniques to develop 
language, content and engage in discussions of multiple perspectives.

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
I.S. 145Q maintains a partnership with the Goodwill Industries Beacon Program at P.S. 
149Q.  Both our student and parent population are encouraged to take advantage of the different 
services (workshops, sports activities) they provide to the community.   
Parents will be trained in topics such as: How to monitor their children's performance using 
Skedula, School Curriculum and Grading Policy, How to assist their children with school work, 
How to talk to adolescents, How to determine gang and drug-related behavior, How to 
familiarize themselves with the Board of Education Regulations (Discipline Code, choosing the 
appropriate High School, etc.). These workshops will be conducted by the our guidance 
counselors and the PTA and will take place  once a month from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM.  Materials 
will be provided on the topics outlined above and there will be translation and interpretation 
services for all these workshops. 
October 9 we will have a High School Night to inform and help parents with the application 
process. On the 17th, we will have a workshop about how can parents help their children to stay 
away from rigs and alcohol. On the 23 we will have a workshop about how to improve children 
self-esteem.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
IS 145 uses the computer based software MYON  to assess students' reading comprehension as measured by Lexile Levels. 
Once the student receives a score, it is then converted to its grade level equivalent. Teachers use the data to guide 
instructional planning. The students are assessed at least three times a year. In addition, teachers assess all ELLs in the four 
modalities as reflected in our grading policy: projects, exams, class work, and homework. 
 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We hold Departmental Meetings where teachers collaboratively analyze assessment data, look a student work and share 
resources. We diligently follow the grading policy and use the computer based program. 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Teachers meet to analyze the NYSESLAT results and students' trends in the four modalities. In addition, teachers create and 
administer department baseline tests and midterms. Teachers use the state item analysis results as benchmarks for their 
discussions and subsequently design interventions to target areas in need of improvement in order to help ELLs. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers' lesson plans show both content and language objectives in all subjects. These are used to guide instruction and 
maintain a focus on language development. There is co-teaching approach to further support ELLs. Teachers meet with the 
Instructional Coaches to plan and implement students' interventions. Then, they engage in collaborative inter-visitations and 
reflections. Teachers share different teacher generated assessments.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The vast majority of the new admits from Spanish speaking countries were tested, but unable to answer any parts of the 
English Lab-R test. However, they performed above 70 percentile in the Spanish Lab-R. ELLs take the  NYSESLAT to assess their 
performance in all four modalities. All ELLs take the Math State Exam. All 8th grade ELLS take the Science State Exam. All 
ELLs take the ELA Sate Exam, excluding the exempt students. ALL 8th grade ELLs in Bilingual Programs take the High School 
Proficiency Exam. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 
Teachers receive data at the beginning of the school year. The Data Specialist prepares and presents to the staff the 
assessment results.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

A) Stand alone model where students are grouped homogeneously based upon proficiency levels and parental choice. 
Students travel as a block to the different content area teachers. All content areas are departmentalized. The 
integrated model has two teachers, an ELA and and ENL Licensed teacher.   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Newly arrived ELLs in bilingual classes receive 60% of their instruction in Spanish and 40 % of the instruction in English 
including 180 minutes of Home Language Arts (Spanish)  a week. English periods increase accordingly as they become 
more proficient in the English Language. Students travel as a block to the different content area teachers. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

 Dual Language classes follow a 50-50 model including four (4) periods of  Spanish Language Arts. Science, Social 
Studies and Mathematics are taught in English and Spanish on alternate days.This is not a side by side Dual Language 
model. Students come to IS 145 being completely bi-literate in English and Spanish. Students travel as a block to the 
different content area teachers 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ENLs in the Free Standing Program receive 360 minutes of English and 5 periods of  45 
minutes in Mathematics, Science and Social Studies. ALL Expanding ENLs are in the Stand Alone Programs where they receive 
180 minutes of ENL and 180 minutes of ELA. In addition, they receive 5 periods of 45 minutes of Science, Math and Social 
Studies. Just the Entering and Emerging ENLs are in a Spanish Transitional Bilingual Program. They receive 360 minutes of 
English, 5 periods of  45 minutes in Mathematics, Science, Social studies in Spanish and 4 periods of Spanish Language Arts. All 
commanding students  receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction by a licensed ESL teacher. They take 8 periods of ELA, 5 periods of 
Mathematics, Science and Social Studies in English. Each period is 45 minutes. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
ELLs in Free-standing Programs receive all instruction in English. TBE students follow the 60-40 (Spanish to English) model per 
CR Part 154. They also receive instruction in Home Language Arts Spanish five periods a week. Students in Dual Language 
Programs receive instruction in English and Spanish, alternating from day to day, in Science, Social Studies and 
Mathematics.  DL students follow a 50-50 (English/ Spanish) model.  They also receive four periods a week of 
Spanish Language Arts.  Content area teachers are well-informed and trained to use the CCLS to plan, deliver, provide 
interventions and assess to ensure that all ELLs are receiving rigorous instruction per the CCLS.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

We administer the Spanish LAB-R, Home Language Arts Spanish Performance Assessments, News ELA and teacher-made 
writing baseline assessments. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

(A) SIFE are part of our After School Program. In addition, a cohort of teachers volunteer to give up their professional periods 
to provide basic literacy interventions every day for 45 minutes. Subject teachers tailor their lessons to meet the basic needs 
of this population following a literacy approach and use small group instruction to provide students' individualized 
support. Myon results are used as a baseline assessment in English and Spanish. 
(B) Newcomer students join different after school programs to receive support by licensed content area teachers. Books are 
purchased to meet their reading interest levels and appropriate Lexile level. They also participate in a Summer School 
Enrichment Program. A cultural component of Title III allows them to go on trips to acclimate themselves to the new culture. 
Flexible grouping within classrooms allows teachers to pair students up with home language partners, where they are able to 
support one another. Students are assessed in all four modalities, allowing them with more opportunities to demonstrate 
mastery.  
(C) Developing students are provided multiple opportunities to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in all subject areas. 
Content area programming allows developing students to feel successful in areas such as Math, Science, and the Arts where 
their mastery can be demonstrated through a variety of projects and products. Teachers survey student interest and and 
learning styles to guide instruction. They also support their learning and language development by utilizing multiple discussion 
techniques.  
(D) Long-term students are supported by push-in ESL and subject  teachers that co-plan and co-teach to continuously reinforce 
the reading and writing skills. Teachers are encouraged to infuse literacy protocols such as Close Reading and citing evidence 
from non-fiction text to promote comprehension,  accountable talk and increase their fluency and confidence. These are the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

areas that the item analysis show they struggle the most. 
(E) Former ELLs receive 90 minutes of ENL instruction by a licensed ESL teacher. In addition, they receive testing 
accommodations for all State Assessments. Teachers continue to include a language objective in all lesson plans that 
forefronts language development. They also continue to use effective ELL strategies such as incorporating visuals, realia, audio 
and modified texts to enhance student learning.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
IEPs are used to inform the teacher about students' present levels of performance in academic, behavioral, and physical 
development. Multiple intelligence surveys and baseline assessments are also used to help guide instruction. Teachers set 
goals for the four modalities: reading, writing, listening & speaking. Teachers use technology to enhance classroom instruction, 
to allow for student collaboration and research. Tools such as Chromebooks powered by Google Education Suite empowers 
students to demonstrate their understanding and mastery of concepts in a variety of ways, allowing them access to content 
materials. Chromebooks also support students with gross and fine motor skills deficiencies the ability to use text to speech and 
keyboarding.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses scheduling flexibility that includes NYSAA, 12:1:1 , 12:1, ICT, and SETTS programming to enable ELL-SWDs to 
achieve their IEP goals and attain English proficiency. In addition, they have related services such as speech therapy, 
occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Adaptive physical education is also built into their schedules. All of our extra-
curricular activities and clubs such as STEM Club, BEAM Camp, and robotics are also available for all our ELL-SWDs.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELLs receive instructional support by push-in ENL teachers who co-teach with content teachers, especially in ELA. In addition, 
all our content area teachers are highly trained in using ENL methodologies to promote language development and  content 
acquisition, emphasizing Tier III vocabulary words. Teachers also use a large array of scaffolding techniques and multiple entry 
points to differentiate instruction to better cater to the individual needs of our students.  Students in the Freestanding ENL 
program and TBE program also recieve an additional literacy class which aims to support transferable literacy skills that 
support academic English development. ELLs also benefit from after school programs and computer-based literacy programs, 
which students can access from home.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on the NYSESLAT and ELA State Exams Results  our students need further support in writing. Writing will be infused in all 
content areas. Domain three from Advanced Literacy will be incorporated as an instructional norm. Each student will keep a 
reflective journal. Teachers will use it as tool to monitor students' growth. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

None. All mandated programs will continue to be offered to students, parents and teachers.       
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are invited and encouraged to benefit from all curricula and extracurricular activities. (clubs, tutoring, basketball team, 
trips, music, art, dance, etc). 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
All teachers working with ESL students have Smart Boards, Chromebooks/Mac books, iPads and subscriptions to literacy 
software such as Myon, News ELA.  Parents can monitor their child's progress and communicate with teachers via the online 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

grade book (Skedula). All students have their personalized Gmail where they can communicate with classmates and teachers. 
Students use Google drive as a digital portfolio and use Google docs and slides to publish their work. 
 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Spanish Native Language Arts teachers mirror the ELA Expeditionary Learning Curriculum to write their units. They put 
together theme-based units, identify high order thinking skills to be addressed, and create assessment tasks to meet CCLS 
goals. Teachers  have also created in-house assessments aligned to the Home Language Arts Spanish Performance 
Assessments. Teachers have leveled Spanish Classroom Libraries. Students have access to digital content in Spanish through 
Myon and News ELA. Students have content area books in English and Spanish for Social Studies, Math and Science.  
 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Teachers and administrators ensure that curriculum is developed, taking into consideration students cognitive and socio-
emotional development. Teachers promote grade level, rigorous instruction and assess student performance accordingly. 
Teachers use and adjust the city's suggested curricula in all subjects. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Not Applicable 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
During the admission process students and parents receive a comprehensive orientation individually by the principal. ELLs who 
enroll before the school year are well informed about the different academic programs offered at the school. In addition, ELLs 
enrolled before the school year as well as those enrolled during the first year receive ongoing support from the school 
staff.  The school strives to provide a welcoming environment by celebrating our enormously diverse multicultural student 
community.  Furthermore,  newly enrolled ELLs are paired up with a class "buddy", who helps the new student navigate 
through the school building and follow their class schedule.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

We do not offer any language electives to our ELLs at this moment. However, we are in the process of hiring the required staff, 
pending budget, to offer these electives.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Our Dual Language program follows the 50/50 instructional model across all grades. ELLs in our Dual 
Language program receive extra support via a licensed ENL teacher. All students in our Dual Language 
program receive self-contained instruction for all content areas. Language acquisition is infused across all 
content areas as all our teachers target linguistic objectives as part of their lesson plans. Students in our 
Dual Language program are taught in English and Spanish alternately, day to day,  as we continue the 
model of instruction followed in their elementary schools.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
The teachers servicing ELLs meet on a weekly basis for Professional Development (“PD”).  They meet by department and 
cluster (DL, ESL, BIL.) teams. All teachers in the push-in model of instruction work collaboratively with their respective subject 
teachers in monitoring the academic growth of this population. They are mainly trained in co-teaching strategies, looking at 
student work and creating differentiated tasks. In addition, on-site staff-developers support teachers by offering 1-1 planning, 
implementation, and reflection sessions. 
Teacher leaders, coaches, departmental administrators, staff from our Superintendent's Office and the Office of English 
Language Learners (“OELL”) are instrumental in supporting the staff working with ELLs. Teachers have been highly trained in 
moderating students’ work, implementing the workshop model, Advanced Literacy strategies, and differentiating instruction 
by content, process, and product.  Teachers will use the following books for their study groups and weekly PD sessions: 
"Subjects Matter - Every Teacher's Guide to Content- Area Reading by Harvey Daniels and Steven Zemelman, Differentiating 
Instruction for Students with Learning Disabilities by William N. Bender, Text Complexity Raising Rigor in Reading" by Douglas 
Fisher among others. 
We will also continue providing teachers opportunities for PD outside of I.S. 145.  Teachers will be encouraged to attend 
workshops offered by the OELLs such as:  ELL Writing Institute, Middle School Math Institute, Science Institute, and others. The 
ESL and content area teachers will be trained in how to utilize the Academic Language and Literacy Diagnostics (“ALLD”) and 
Oral Interview Questionnaire to identify the SIFE.  Also, teachers will be part of an inquiry team whose main focus will be to 
find research-based instructional methodologies to further develop their understanding of how to best tailor their instruction 
to target the individual needs of the focused population.  Furthermore, teachers will receive extensive training in the use of 
computer-based software specifically designed to target the needs of our SIFE and Long-Term ELLs.  
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The Guidance Counselor and the Assistant Principal provide orientation to the parents in completing the HS Admission. 
The teachers servicing ELLs meet on a weekly basis for a total of one hour and 15 minutes for Professional Development 
(“PD”).  They meet by department and cluster (DL, ESL, BIL.) teams. All teachers in the push-in model of instruction work 
collaboratively with their respective subject teachers in monitoring the academic growth of this population during their 5 
professional periods per week. They are mainly trained in co-teaching strategies, looking at student work and creating 
differentiated tasks. 
Teacher leaders, coaches, departmental administrators,  the Office of English Language Learners (“OELL”) are instrumental in 
supporting the staff working with ELLs. Teachers have been highly trained in moderating students’ work, implementing the 
workshop model, Quality Teaching for English Learners (“QTEL”) strategies, and differentiating instruction by content, process, 
and product.  Teachers will use the following books for their study groups and weekly PD sessions: "Text Complexity Raising 
Rigor in Reading" by Douglas Fisher, "Pathways to the Common Core" by Lucy Calkins, and "Questioning the Author" by Isabel 
L. Beck among others. 
We will also continue providing teachers opportunities for PD outside of I.S. 145.  Teachers will be encouraged to attend 
workshops offered by the OELLs such as:  ELL Writing Institute, Middle School Math Institute, Science Institute, and others. The 
ESL and content area teachers will be trained in how to utilize the Academic Language and Literacy Diagnostics (“ALLD”) and 
Oral Interview Questionnaire to identify the SIFE.  Also, teachers will be part of an inquiry team whose main focus will be to 
find research-based instructional methodologies to further develop their understanding of how to best tailor their instruction 
to target the  individual needs of the focused population.  Furthermore, teachers will receive extensive training in the use of 
computer-based software specifically designed to target the needs of our SIFE and Long-Term ELLs.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
There is an open-door policy for parents of ELLs at I.S. 145.  Also, parents are welcome to take ESL, Computer and GED classes 
offered at the school site. These classes enable parents to acclimate themselves to the DOE school system by being parents 
and students themselves. The school sponsors Open House for parents to inform parents about what is expected of them in 
the critical role they play. Every Tuesday, parents are invited to make an appointment to discuss goals of the program, 
language development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content 
areas. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents can also attend workshops, conducted once per month by our Parent Coordinator, on topics such as:  How to Assist 
your Children with Schoolwork; How to Talk to Adolescents; How to Determine Gang and Drug-Related Behavior, How to 
Familiarize Yourself with the Board of Education Regulations (Discipline Code, Choosing the appropriate High School, etc.).  
 

 

 

Additional Information

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Ivan F Rodriguez, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Based on the data in the Home Language Identification Survey and ATS Reports, this school is 87% Spanish, 3% 
Bengali/Urdu, as well as 16 other low-incidental languages. Since we have a multicultural staff, the school 
accommodates the language translations accordingly. The school accesses translated documents from the 
Department of Education to communicate with parents of different languages, for example, Discipline Codes, Title 
III and Title I entitlement letters, amongst others are all provided to students in the parents' native tongue. We 
leave notifications on parents' voice mail using the school-wide system in both English and Spanish. Students are 
provided with written or oral translations for all state exams. In addition, the monthly School Parent Letter is 
translated into Spanish.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In case of emergencies, our school's communication strategy with parents that cannot communicate in English will 
include: 

  Use of translation services of on site bilingual staff to communicate with parents via text, phone call or any 

other digital means. 

  Use of the translation services provided by the D.O.E's Division of Family and Community Engagement (FACE.) 

Staff members will use the 1-800-231-0288 number, indicate the language needed from a selection of 150 
and relay pertinent information.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Information will be shared in the beginning of the year via departmental meetings. A copy of the Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663 goal and the resources that are available will distributed to teachers digitally. All administration and 
secretarial staff will have the resources readily available to distribute and use.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We will comply with all of the above translation notifications as per Section VII of Chancellor's Regulation A-663 by:  

  having translated signage that will be visible as parents enter the building, our school website that will have a 

tab dedicated for providing information digitally translated in their home language.  

  Distributing Brochures /flyers/letters shared with parents will be translated in parent's home language 
  ensuring that the PTA coordinator and other bilingual staff will be present during PTA meetings, Open Houses 

and parent workshops, to ensure that parents are aware of their rights to receive information in their home 
language.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

During Open House and PTA meetings, parents will be informed of translated feedback surveys available in their 
home languages. Parents will also be directed to surveys available on the school website and the school main office. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66
