Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

We see our school as a community where all members, students, staff and parents respectfully support each other, 
address, accept and meet the needs of individuals and create an atmosphere where learning, creativity and 
participation take place. Members of our community are life-long learners, flexible and adaptable to change, 
responsible and accountable and are active participants in our school and society. We have long term goals, high self-
esteem, respect for one another. The members develop and practice decision-making skills, critical thinking skills and 
communicate effectively.

P. S. 175Q, The Lynn Gross Discovery School is based on the proposition that children are seekers of meaning. Our 
mission is to supplement recitation with learning experiences that harness a child’s natural inquisitive nature to 
explore and discover. The Lynn Gross Discovery School engages children in investigations self-selected from age 
appropriate themes in the natural and social sciences. Our children are provided with opportunities to identify their 
interests and develop their multiple intelligences in a child centered, risk free atmosphere, which encourages 
cooperation, teamwork and respect for the individual. Independence, self-reliance, confidence and the ability to 
identify and solve problems are anticipated outcomes for all of our students. We are a diverse, collaborative school 
community dedicated to achieving high standards of academic excellence for all of our students. Parents and family 
members are equal partners with the school in supporting all of our children as life-long learners. 

 

 

 

Our primary goal is to improve classroom instruction and student achievement.  

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
P.S. 175Q. is located in a densely populated section of Rego Park, Queens and serves 814 children in Pre-K to Grade 5. 
Large apartment buildings and a number of attached and semi-attached houses surround the school. The community 
is multi-ethnic in character with a predominantly large Russian/White population 64.39%, Hispanic 12.25%, Black 
1.52%, Asian 20.2% and other 0%.  

The student population is heterogeneously grouped within each grade and supported by a pedagogical staff of 50 
teachers. P. S. 175Q is an approximately 67-year old brick building with 4 floors including the basement where the 
auditorium and cafeteria are located. 

 

Instructional Focus is Multiple Entry Points, to provide access for all students of all ability levels because we believe all 
students should have access to the rigorous core curriculum and whereby all students are engaged. In order to bring 
access to all learners rather than relying only on printed materials and whole class lecture notes, teachers incorporate 
differentiation small group instruction, individualized instruction, inquiry learning, Universal Design for Learning, and 
multiple formats to represent information and enhance student engagement, e.g. the use of visuals, technology, 
multiple versions of a story, various strategies for solving math problems or the use of the scientific method. Teachers 
use multimedia collections, including images, sounds, text, video, concept maps, thinking maps, web links or 
animation of text – meaning and supplemental programs that will facilitate student learning and academic 
achievement. Teacher Teams collaborate in order to analyze student work and student assessments to identify gaps 
and individual student needs in order to prepare students for career and college. 

 

Student Achievement 2017-2018 indicate that in both areas of ELA and Mathematics there has been some progress in 
both levels three and four.

Challenges 

Various challenges are present in our school. Currently our school is faced fiscal challenges. Our school is a non Title I 
school. Family incomes have increased. Primary caregivers work long hours. English as a new language is a challenge 
for many students and for their family members. Children spend extensive time with grandparents and participate in 
late hour after school programs. 

Our school classrooms are filled to capacity. Many of the children enter school with little or no previous school 
experience. Our three full-time Pre-K classes provide essential early childhood education for our students.  

Rigorous Instruction

Student Assessment: i-Ready  

All students in grades K-5 were administered three diagnostic and prescriptive tests.Teachers and school 
administrators analyzed student test results to establish trends and patterns. Teachers assigned specific lessons to 
individual students.  

Children were assigned a minimum of twenty minutes per day in both literacy and mathematics. Parents received 
their child’s hard copy report and parents could monitor their child’s progress online. The expectation is that there 
will be a direct positive correlation between increased “i ready time on task” and improved student test results on the 
NYS English Language Arts and Mathematics examinations. 

DRA-2, MOSL, Performance Tasks, Ready Gen and Go Math 

Classroom teachers administer two DRA-2 examinations in grades K-2. 

Classroom teachers administer two MOSL examinations in grades K-5. 

Classroom teachers administer pre test and post test in both Ready Gen and Go Math.  

Performance Task Assessments in English Language Arts 

Performance Task Assessments in Mathematics  

Special Staff 

Two full time ESL teachers provide additional support for our English Language Learners in a separate setting in order 
to increase the student’s English language acquisition through listening, speaking, reading and writing activities.  

One SETSS teacher provides support services for children with special educational needs. When this teacher indicated 
provides consultant teacher services for targeted students in the classroom. Other service providers in the school are 
speech (monolingual and bilingual), occupational and physical therapists.  

Parent’s Association 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

A strong Parents Association helps provide support through their fund raising activities. Funds raised support the 
school through the purchase of materials that enrich the curriculum. The Parents’ sponsors a paid Thinking Caps After 
School Program. This program offers many of our working parents a wonderful alternative to child-care. We continue 
to offer various workshops during the P. A. evening meetings in order to increase participation. This approach is very 
successful. The Parents Association produces a PA of 175Q webpage and gathers all parent email addresses in order 
to keep the parents and student family members informed.  

School Strengths 

School is a safe place where students engage in learning and thrive in a supportive environment achieving intellectual 
and emotional goals.  

The school principal is proactive in identifying additional grants and funding resources which result in effective 
decision making and programming around teaching and learning.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
2017 and 2018 New York State student results in English Language Arts, Mathematics and Science are not available. 
However our students who met the standards is far greater than the few students who did not meet the standards. 

Grade 3, 4 and 5 student levels of achievement in all academic areas have need for improvement. All students are yet 
to achieve levels 3 & 4.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, teachers will incorporate strategies for understanding Tier II and Tier III text based vocabulary into their 
design for Rigorous Instruction so that all students can become independent in their ability to navigate complex texts. 
This will be measured by an increase of ten percent of students moving up at least three reading levels using i-Ready 
Assessment as compared with 2017 to 2018 results.

Teacher team work and collaborative professional learning engages teachers. During Common Preps and Monday 
Learning Sessions teachers devote time to discussing their practice with peers. Teachers during inquiry team work 
sharpen content and expertise. Teachers schedule times to visit colleagues’ classrooms and study student and teacher 
work so that intended improvements becomes consistent and most apparent across classrooms. The assistant 
principal participates in literacy and math study groups to expand knowledge and effectiveness. During Monday 
Professional Learning Sessions teacher’s model and share new learning with the entire school community. 

During Inquiry Teacher Team Meetings teachers focus and analyze Present Levels of Performance for individual 
students based on various methods including pre and mid assessments and then plan instruction targeted towards 
supporting students in meeting the Common Core Learning Standards, integrating them into planning, preparation 
and cohesive instruction. 

Research supports that careful curriculum design leads to instruction and tasks that accelerate student growth, 
increased (H. O. T.) higher order thinking skills, and provide students with essential knowledge and skills to meet the 
real-world demands of college and post secondary success. Thoughtful examination of the curricula also enables 
teachers to make informed decisions that result in increased, progressive preparation for students to engage in 
challenging, higher-level work.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Lynn Gross Discovery, P. S. 175 Queens, in compliance with the (ESSA) is responsible for creating and implementing a 
parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and 
the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Lynn Gross Discovery, P. S. 175 Queens, will support parents and families of all students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

In developing Parent Involvement Policy, parent members of the school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Parent 
Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and improve parent 
involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s 
Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association). This includes providing technical support and ongoing professional 
development, especially in developing leadership skills;

The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., () accountability system, 
student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and workshops 
that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.

Program Outline 
Rationale: One supervisor, two ENL teachers and one Arts Education Program teaching artist 
will be assigned to the After School Academy English as a Second Language.  The After School 
Academy English as a Second Language Program will meet 2 hours during each session for a 
total of 16 sessions from January 2015 to March 2015.  The principal will supervise the teachers 
and students.  The English Language Learner teacher is certified and has an abundance of 
research based knowledge, school based experience, a relationship with the QSFSC ELL 
Specialist and a resource for materials/instructional strategies.   
Student Groups: ELL participants as stated who attend grades 3, 4 and 5 include entering, 
emerging, transitioning, expanding and commanding levels of achievement.  In addition PS 175 
Q ELL students include student subgroups SWD and Long Term ELLs.  Student subgroups do 
not include SIFE students. 
Schedule and Duration: Students will meet once a week for two hours on Wednesday from 2:20 
to 4:20. 
Language of Instruction:  The primary language of instruction will be English. However students 
will not be discouraged from clarifying a concept, idea or instruction in their first language.  At 
all times our students must know that their first language, culture and family traditions are 
respected at  
P. S. 175 Queens. 
Teacher:  As previously stated the program will staff two certified ELL teachers, and one 
teaching artist. 
Types of Materials:  The teachers will use NYSESLAT workbook/skill books, Thinking Maps, 
Safari Montage Visual/Auditory Media Materials, various Art Materials (paints, fabric, 
cardboard, paper, glue, recycle materials - egg cartons  and new craft materials) 
  
Program Narrative 
English Language Learner students in grade 3, grade 4, and grade 5 will strengthen English 
Language Learner skills in reading/writing, and listening/speaking.  The Common Core Learning 
Standards as applied to English Language Learners will be a valuable instructional resource tool. 
Twenty Five students are selected to participate on Wednesday afternoons in an after 
school  program based on the Spring 2018 NYSESLAT Scores and/or ELA Scores.  Students 
who do not have Spring 2018 scores will qualify based on screening during new admits 
registration and NYSITELL Scores. 
The students will receive instruction from two highly qualified ENL teachers.  The third teacher 
will be a teaching artist from a well established Arts Education Program.  The reduced student to 
teacher ratio is an optimum factor to increase levels of student achievement.  Results from the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
ELL Periodic Assessment inform teachers.  As the ENL teachers "drills down" instruction is 
matched with each student's needs.  The term "drills down" refers to the content/skill determined 
as necessary/appropriate because of  student assessments (ENL State Examinations, I-Ready 
Assessments, MOSL, DRA-2, Ready Gen and Go Math).  The ENL teachers articulate with the 
classroom teacher to compile student data.  The ultimate goal is that English Language Learners 
achieve a level of "Commanding" on the spring 2019 NYSESLAT New York State English as a 
Second Language Achievement Test. 
Each group of students will have the opportunity to receive and practice "English Language 
Learner" instructional strategies that support "Common Core Academic Subject/Vocabulary" 
instruction, and arts instruction best designed to meet the needs, abilities and interests of each 
student. 
All students meet maximum success when instruction is differentiated.  Teachers are P. S. 175 
Queens are experts in using Thinking Maps and Depth of Knowledge (DOK) Levels as they 
facilitate learning. 
The NYCDOE suggests using an Arts Education Program supports students as they acquire 
additonal languages. An acclaimed Arts Program will supplement traditional teaching techniques 
and strategies.  The teaching techniques and strategies will be aligned with Common Core 
Standards in English Language Arts.   The Arts Program teaches children English and develops 
their literacy skills through individualized instruction. The quiet and reluctant speaker/reader 
successfully rehearses and performs as an actor or as the person who speaks for the puppet.   An 
expertly designed literacy curriculum which supports the five areas (phonemic awareness, 
phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension) with theatre and music. The Arts Program 
supports the NYSESLAT assessment areas of:  listening and speaking, with reading and 
writing.  It is expected that students will have the opportunity to practice self reflection, peer 
evaluation and monitor their progress.   
It is expected that students will develop independence, self-reliance, confidence and the ability to 
demonstrate team building.  The Arts Program will inspire children to celebrate diversity of 
culture and family traditions.  
The MARQUIS STUDIO ARTS EDUCATION PROGRAM two projects are described below 
 (Shadow Puppetry and Puppetry) 
SHADOW PUPPETRY 
In the ancient art of shadow puppetry, cut out forms create beautiful visual effects as they are 
held against a cloth screen and lit from behind. In this residency, the students create 
representational puppets from cardboard, tissue paper and colored plastic. The class will perform 
an original script written by the students. The curriculum covers the history of many cultures that 
use shadow puppetry – from Turkey, along the spice routes, and back to Asia. The Teaching 
Artist compares and contrasts the use of shadow puppetry in different cultures, such as the 
religious rituals of Indonesia compared to the rough-and-ready Kargouz of Turkey. The class 
learns the various skills of puppetry, which include drawing, color composition, sculpture and 
drama. Once the puppets are made, and a script has been written, the class begins the puppet 
show production- staging, scenery design, music and sound effects. In the rehearsal process, the 
student is encouraged to build vocal projection and theater skills, as well as build vocabulary. 
Self-confidence and free expression is enhanced through this process. 
* Performances will be given for parents as well as peers in the classroom. 
* This program makes a connection to the curriculum in Social Studies and Literacy. 
  
PUPPETRY 
In this residency, each student creates his or her own paper-mache puppet to use in an original 
performance. The student creates distinct, recognizable characters that come alive through 
costumes, props, shape of features and expressions. The class learns the various skills of 
puppetry art, which include design, sketching, sculpture and painting. Once the puppets are

Professional Development Outline 
Rationale:  At P. S. 175 Queens it is important to share the research, methods, and strategies of 
facilitating learning for our ELL students with all teachers.  At P. S. 175 Queens there are two 
certified ELL teachers.  There are thirty seven classroom teachers which include both general 
education and special education teachers.  
Teachers to receive training:  Chancellor Richard A. Carranza has dedicated Monday afternoons 
for "Professional Learning." At P. S. 175 Queens the topic of how to best facilitate learning for 
ELL students was identified by our Professional Learning Committee.  The certified ELL teacher 
will conduct professional learning sessions for two separate groups K-2 teachers and 3-5 
teachers.  One group will view a video resource selected by the ELL teacher as the other group 
works with the ELL teacher.  Then the groups will "flip" activities. The professional 
development will positively effect the ELL children because the general education teachers will 
use the strategies they will be taught in their classroom therefore giving the ELL's more support 
within their general education classroom. 
Schedule and Duration:  The professional learning sessions will take place on a Monday and last 
per the UFT contract regulations. At P.S. 175 we use cycles of PD which last 6 weeks, within 
each 6 week cycle there will be 2 PD's dedicated to supporting our ELL children.  The PD's will 
last from 2:20 pm to 3:40 pm on Mondays during 2 of the Mondays in the 6 week cycles. There 
will be 14 ELL PD's in total throughout the school year.  
Record Keeping: P.S. 175 has a Professional Development Committee made up of teachers, 
support staff, paraprofessionals and the Assistant principal; this committee discusses which 
PD's are necessary and would be beneficial to our teachers and students. On this committee we 
review agendas and keep attendance records to verify the staff is getting the support they 
need.  Agendas and attendance records will be kept in a binder with the professional 
development committee. The records are kept in the Assistant principals office. We also have 
discussions at the end of each cycle of feedback we have gotten about the PD's. If necessary we 
have staff fill out evaluation forms and mid year questionnaires to decide next steps.  
Topics to be covered: Common Core Aligned Lessons, Strategies that Support English Language 
Learners, How to Support Parents of English Language Learners, English Language Learner 
Video Library, etc 
Name of Providers: P. S. 175 certified teachers Stephanie Kalinowski and Bilin Nizich. In 
addition Ms. Kalinowski and Ms. Nizich will have the opportunity to attend QSFSC ELL 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57

meetings and NYCDOE Central Office of English Language Learner professional development 
sessions at various locations. Again, professional development will last on Mondays from 
2:20pm to 3:40pm. 
 Professional Development Narrative 
Professional Development will be provided on how to use Arts Education in the classroom and 
ENL Program.  This training will be provided by a teaching artist from The Arts Program at no 
cost to the school.  Teachers and school administrators receive professional development for the 
Title III Program from a variety of sources at various locations: NYC Office of English 
Language Learners conduct ongoing Institutes, QSFSC instructional specialists and leading guest 
speakers.  The ENL teachers, common branch teachers, special education teachers and the 
assistant principal attend the professional development sessions.  Topics include:  
1. Response to Intervention for ELLs, 2. Mathematics for ELLs 3. Academic Language for 
ELLs, 4. Technology for ELLs, etc. Teachers return to P. S. 175 Queens.  They facilitate/present 
during staff professional learning sessions, distribute hand-outs, and model instructional 
strategies. All teachers attend the professional learning sessions that last 45 minutes.  The staff 
professional learning sessions are scheduled a minimum of three times.  The "Lead Teachers" are 
available to model lessons, push into classrooms, and to conduct inter class visitations. In 
addition teachers receive current articles from leading educational publications. 

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At P.S. 175 we use the DRA and the MOSL baseline data, as well as data from I-Ready.  These assessments test decoding skills, 
comprehensions skills and provide a lexile level for each student. The results are shared with the ENL teachers so that the 
classroom teacher and ENL teacher can create goals for individual ELL children. Data from these assessments reveals reading 
levels and strengths and weaknesses each child has. This drives instruction for the school year.  The data provides both ENL 
and classroom teachers insight on how to group students within the classroom, what skills the children are lacking and allows 
the teacher to target specific skills.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

To support our efforts to insure every ELL child grows academically during the school year we administer all the above names 
assessments three times a year, in the beginning, middle and then at the end. This gives the classrooms teachers and the ENL 
teachers a clear picture of the progress the children are making. These assessments help the teachers to instruct and 
appropriately challenge each student. The data specialists guides the teacher through the data and helps them analyze the 
date carefully. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At P.S. 175 we evaluate the success of our ENL program by looking at and analyzing the New York State Test scores (ELA, Math 
and Science), as well as the results of the NYSESLAT and analyzing the modality scores. The ENL teacher speaks to classroom 
teachers on a weekly basis to check in on progress of the ELL students. If a child is not making adequate progress the ENL 
teacher offers support in the form of materials or a push in support. The ENL teacher shares data with the classroom teachers 
from the NYSESLAT, and I-Ready to insure adequate progress is being made. If progress is not being made we may look to 
additional ENL service and getting suggestions from the RTI team.     
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the summative data has been gathered interventions are put in place where needed. P.S.175 uses our RTI team to 
provide intervention. We train the teachers on how to do RTI in the classroom, we show them how to modify and differentiate 
work to meet the needs of all the children. RTI includes different subject areas where the children may need intervention. 
RTI also includes the use of thinking maps, visuals, technology, and audio. RTI gives children an intensive approach to what skill 
they may be lacking in. For example if a child struggles with writing for information purposes, the RTI team will create a small 
group of children who need help with that skill and focus solely on that skill and continuously assess the children's progress to 
insure they can write an informational piece of writing. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 175 uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework by targeting children who need 
extra support and really examining the child and determining what he/she needs. On our Response to Intervention team we 
have our Assistant Principal, ENL teacher, Speech teacher, Social Worker, Psychologist and a general education teacher. We 
accept referrals of children from classroom teachers,but we first give the teachers suggestions on what they can do to help the 
child, such as if it is a behavioral issue we help them implement a behavior plan. With the ELL children the ENL teacher will give 
support and suggestions such as a possible push in session to observe and make recommendations. The ESL teacher may 
suggest using picture support and more vocabulary instruction.We also make sure a students cultural and linguistic 
background are not hindering progress. Our teachers use multiple entry points to deliver instruction which helps all children 
understand rigorous material.  Our RTI team makes recommendations on a case by case basis and treats every case 
individually to insure that every student makes progress. The team works together to do this and meets on a regular basis to 
discuss students and progress. Our RTI team also meets with the teachers to discuss grade level concerns and possible 
solutions to concerns.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Data patterns that are revealed from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT testing are that as the children move up through the grades 
they tend to advance according to NYSESLAT proficiency levels. The data also reveals that children in grades one and two tend 
to move up a level and even gain proficient status on the NYSESLAT. This is a trend that appears especially if a child starts with 
ENL in Kindergarten. In recent years we have also seen more students in fourth grade testing at a proficient level on the 
NYSESLAT. We attribute this gain to the test taking experience the children have through the years and the implementation of 
the I-ready assignments in conjunction with the ENL services provided. The ENL services that are provided are both stand 
alone and integrated. The principal, assistant principal, ENL teacher and data specialist carefully analyze the NYSESLAT data to 
drive instruction for ELL children.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

 

We have flexible programming in place which allows children to move to different groups depending on their skill level and 
strengths and weaknesses. At P.S. 175 we have all the ELL children on each grade in one class to provide the teacher with 
support on how to help the ELL children. The ENL teacher in conjunction with the classroom teacher plan lessons together to 
insure all the ELL children are getting the support they need. We make adjustments to our programs when needed based on 
data. We group children within the classroom also based on the data. We group children in a variety of ways 
including heterogeneously and homogeneously. We also use IReady Assessments to target skills the children need. Currently 
we do not have the need for a Dual Language or Transitional Bilingual Program. We do have the support of the RTI team on a 
case by case basis.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Instruction for ELL children is currently delivered in a stand alone and integrated fashion. Students are pulled out of 
their classrooms for the appropriate amount of minutes according to NYS guidelines. The students are brought to the 
ENL classroom and are instructed in only English.  The students are grouped together by level according to the Spring 
results of the NYSESLAT, English language proficiency, age, academic needs, common core curriculum and common 
core learning standards. Students receive their service during their ELA block, typically the ENL teacher using the 
stand alone model twice a week and the integrated model twice a week. During the stand alone periods within the 
primary classroom new concepts and ideas are never taught. The ENL teacher uses picture support, glossaries and 
dictionaries, as well as Smart Board Interactive technology to deliver instruction. The ENL teacher differentiates 
instruction further within the ENL classroom by breaking the students into leveled groups to work on specific skills the 
children need to strengthen. The ENL teacher always confers with the classroom teachers to identity any skills the ELL 
children may need to develop. The ENL teacher also works with the Ready Gen scope and sequence. Students are also 
instructed in an integrated model, where the ENL teacher goes into the classroom to deliver ENL services. The ENL 
teacher plans lessons with the classroom teacher and differentiates instruction based on student needs. The ENL 
children regardless of their language proficiency level are grouped together in the same primary classroom, the rest of 
the class is made up of general education students. The ENL teacher pushes into the primary classroom to support all 
the ELL's on that particular grade. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

P.S. 175 does not have a TBE program.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

P.S. 175 does not have a DL program, 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

P.S. 175 has 2 ENL teachers that provide ENL service to the ELL children. The ENL teachers schedule is devoted to servicing the 
ELL children. Entering and Emerging ELL students receive 180 minutes of stand alone ENL service and 180 minutes of 
integrated ELA/ENL instruction. Transitioning and Expanding ELL children receive 180 minutes of instruction through the 
integrated model. Commanding ELL students receive 90 minutes of integrated instruction.  All the ENL children on each grade 
are placed in the same primary classroom to better serve their needs and mandates as ELL children. The children receive their 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

mandated minutes during ELA instruction in the classroom which allows the ENL teacher to continue and extend with the 
lesson they are working on in the classroom.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 Instructional areas include: Balanced literacy approach to reading, reading and writing workshop model of instruction, guided 
reading, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, comprehension (cause/effect, author's purpose, drawing conclusions, predictions, 
sequencing, main idea, details, character traits, etc), author studies, resources include: magazines, dictionaries (picture, bi-
lingual, thesaurus, Department of Education content glossaries, mathematics, social studies, science and beginning, 
intermediate, and advanced academic language development are facilitated by the 2 certified ENL teachers.  
The ENL library, school library and classroom libraries contain native language books. 
Mathematics- All seven standards of investigation are facilitated in cooperation with the primary classroom teacher and the 
ENL teachers. Go Math is the program currently being used. 
Science- observation and investigation strategies are used to support the primary classroom teacher and the science cluster 
teacher. 
Social Studies- themes, personal experiences, cultures, traditions, history, current events, and holidays are considered when 
lessons are planned in cooperation with the primary classroom teacher and the ENL teacher. Presently the Social Studies 
curriculum is based around trade books. 
Technology- Instructional websites and curriculum websites foster independence and student paced instruction 
www.starfall.com, www.onemorestory.com, http://www.sciencebuddies.org, www.pbskids.org: The primary clasroom 
teacher, computer teacher and ENL teacher plan in cooperation to yield the best results for each ELL.  
Instructional Strategies include TPR- Total Physical Response and CALLA- Cognitive Academic Language Learning Approach.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

From the day of registration families are spoken to in their native language and given information in the language they are 
most comfortable speaking.  Also in Grades 3-8 when taking the NYS exam the children may be given the NYS exams in their 
native language if available.  Where available the ENL teachers have materials available in the students primary language. 
Classroom teachers who speak the students home language may do informal evaluations to help the ENL teachers get a better 
picture of the whole child.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 a.     SIFE- Students with Interrupted Formal Education 
We never had a SIFE student. 
We would have conferences and meetings scheduled with school personnel, (guidance counselor, attendance teacher, 
classroom teacher, English as a New Language teacher, parent coordinator, and administrators) for the individual student and 
his family member/legal guardian. 
  
We must support this student’s transition back into the school culture. Support may include: peer buddy, at risk service 
support, additional ENL instruction, additional take home materials (picture dictionary, games, photographs), and community 
outreach programs for the parent/legal guardian. 
b.Newcomers 
These new beginners/intermediate ELL students receive a minimum of 360 minutes per week of instruction. All advanced 
students receive a minimum of 180 minutes per week of instruction. In the primary classroom small group instruction with 
language support is provided. Grade K, 1, and 2 do not participate in New York State examinations. After reviewing the New 
York State Administration Guidelines some “Newcomers” are exempt from the ELA exam and some “Newcomers” will take the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

ELA exam after one year of formal instruction (depending on their date of admittance). It is vital that the students be identified 
correctly so that instruction is planned and facilitated to meet individual student needs. Newcomers are paired with a student 
who speaks their first language. Newcomers are paired with an adult school staff member who speaks the student’s first 
language. It is important that the student knows at least one adult who “cares” for and understands the challenges facing 
him/her in their new academic and new cultural environment. Newcomer family members are paired with “veteran” school 
family member who can communicate in their first language. The parent coordinator in cooperation with the classroom 
teacher and ENL teachers makes sure that all school correspondences are written in the first language. 
  
NCLB requires after a full year of formal English language instruction that all Grade 3-8 ELL students take New York State 
English Language Arts exam with appropriate testing accommodations: extended time,and separate location.  All identified ELL 
students are required to take the New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test. ELL students have the 
opportunity to take the Grade 3-8 mathematics and Grade 4 science in an alternate language with appropriate testing 
accommodation as described.  
  
ELL students have the opportunity to participate in an after school Title III Program. 
  
c.     ELL’s Receiving 4 to 6 Years of Service 
These students may work with a paraprofessional for an additional period. Students may have an additional literacy 
instructional with the writing cluster teacher. Students may be assigned to a technology program: Achieve 3000, Cambridge 
Fluency Reading Program, Starrmatica, Imagine Learning.   Students must receive intensive support in developing their area of 
weakness on the NYSESLAT. Usually the area of weakness is Reading and Writing. The 4 to 6 years of service ELL student has 
less difficulty with the Speaking and Listening component of the NYSESLAT. 
  
Technology is a powerful learning tool for ELLs. These students are motivated , and are in “control” and are able to direct their 
learning, select a topic, monitor time on task, receive feedback, multi- sensory, hands-on, promotes collaboration with 
classmates, computers are nonjudgmental, and students can construct meaning and learn in varied and unusual ways, not only 
from the teacher.  
  
The ENL teacher in cooperation with the primary classroom teacher, examine, IReady and MOSL exam results.  An item 
analysis will help identify learning trends of the long term ELL student. 
  
d.     Long Term ELLs (completed 6 year) 
At this time the maximum number of years of service is 5 years, If we did have such a student perhaps increased intensive 
Response to Intervention strategies, leading to “At Risk” ten week services, leading to formal evaluation in order to identify if 
there is a learning disability, or if there is a different reason for why the student demonstrates a delay in English Language 
acquisition. 
  
e.     Former ELLs 
Former ELLs are students identified as testing at a proficient level on the NYSESLAT. Former ELLs are still given support within 
the primary classroom possibly from the ENL teacher when needed. Former ELLs are also given testing accommodations on the 
NYS ELA, Math and Grade 4 Science test which include extended time and a separate location.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 Self-contained special education and SETTS students remain in monolingual classrooms depending on parental ELL option 
requests. Classroom teachers plan closely with the ENL teacher and with special education related service providers. Students 
participate in stand alone and integrated services. All classroom libraries are equipped with non-fiction reading materials that 
ensures that the student can “read” materials on his/her instructional and independent level. The classrooms are equipped 
with a minimum of two computers and one SmartBoard. Some of the instructional materials used are Time for Kids non 
fiction books which are read, then listened to and questions are answered based on the text. The ELL children also listen to 
books on tape.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  The teachers participate in common preparation meetings, staff meetings, grade conferences, vertical meetings and 
curriculum planning meetings. The scheduling is flexible to support the examination of students sample work. Inter class/ inter 
grade teacher visitations, and sharing of “SmartBoard Lessons”. Students participate in “Flexible Programming”. Teachers 
design the schedule for maximum student intellectual, social and emotional success. In some cases where appropriate, 
children in special education classes are flexibly programmed into a general education classroom for their ENL service. Our 
school uses multiple entry points to achieve IEP goals and attain English proficiency. We use visuals, audio, tactile, anchor 
charts, and technology to support the curriculum. We modify unit plans when needed to adjust to the needs of our children. 
We also use enrichment where appropriate.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 English Programs Include: 
At Risk Reading- IEP Teacher, SETTS Teacher 
Academic Intervention and Enrichment classes-After school 
After School ENL Program 
District Summer ENL Program   
Our school uses ReadyGen and GoMath for our curriculum. We enhance each of these programs by using thinking maps, 
visuals, trade books and manipulatives, The teachers carefully dissect each program as a grade and determine the best way to 
use it. The teachers take notes on successes with the program. Intervention programs are based on the units that are being 
taught in the classroom and the children are exposed to the material again in a different way, using multiple entry points to get 
them to understand the information.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

  Increase the number of workshops and seminars attended by the ENL teacher, assistant principal, primary classroom teachers 
and cluster teachers regarding strategies and best practices for instructing ELL students. 
  
Increase ELL student’s parent involvement – attendance at school wide events, participation at parent workshops, plan to 
volunteer and escort students on field trips, participate in CookShop Classroom project, etc. Expand participation in the ENL 
Parent/Family Member Resource Lending Library- Inform parents of ESL/GED adult instruction free opportunities at 
Community Based Organizations.  
The general education teacher and the ENL teacher will work closely to plan lessons to best support each ELL child.There is one 
certified ENL teacher who services Kindergarten, grade 1 and grade 2, and other certified ENL teacher who services third 
grade, fourth grade and fifth grade. The ENL teacher will work in collaboration with the general education teacher to 
differentiate instruction within the classroom, as well as providing support in the stand alone model to give the children the 
tools they need to be successful within their general education classroom. 
We are also going to purchase Imagine Learning for the ENL students. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 ELL students participate in an after school program which incorporates not only ELL strategies but art. ELL students participate 
in all school wide events and individual class field trips. In the ELL supplemental program the children are given support in 
areas such as phonics and vocabulary depending on the needs of the children. The children are assessed and then instruction is 
based on what each individual child needs. Classmates who speak the same language Russian, Chinese, Spanish, etc are paired 
up with the “Newcomer” to support a smooth transition into the building. The Parents Association After School programs 
invites all students to participate. The program is funded by the parents.

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 In the ENL program printed material supports the native language,glossaries, dictionaries, books in the content area, 
magazines and newspapers are valued and welcomed in the classroom. Intelligence in the first language is valued and 
recognized with the expectation that intelligence will be developed and demonstrated in the second language. There are staff 
members who are fluent in the ELL student’s first language. Newcomer students participate in a “buddy program” to support a 
smooth transition. “Veteran” parents reach out to “Newcomer” parents. Many parents ask ”How can I help my child with the 
homework?” Parents are introduced to the multi-lingual “DIAL A TEACHER” program.   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  
 The ENL program facilitated by our two highly qualified ENL teachers correspond to our ELLs’ ages and grade levels as 
described in the section “How is instruction delivered.”  
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 Textbooks include: Ready Gen, Go Math, Scott Foresman Science 
Student Resource Books include: Picture Dictionaries, Glossaries, Foreign Language Dictionaries, Thesaurus, Atlas, and

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
   We hold a Spring Kindergarten Open House. The Parent Coordinator makes parents feel welcomed with handouts in the first 
language. Parents are invited to meet school administrators, ask questions via a translator/interpreter as needed and to tour 
our school. Most families meet the ENL teacher during the Home Language Survey interview, at this point the ENL teacher 
besides conducting the interview will answer any questions the parents may have.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 Instructional language electives are not offered on the elementary school level.   
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b.

c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

We do not have a dual language program.   
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1. The ENL teacher attends various workshops offered including Academic Language and Vocabulary, Field Support Center 
institutes, NYSESLAT training. 
Our general education teachers attend Institutes as well.  
Our ENL teacher presents best practices and research articles focusing on English as a Second Language students during grade 
meetings.  
The science, writing, technology, and art cluster teachers meet with the English as a Second Language teacher to develop 
lesson plans, share strategies and methods that support ELL's.  
All teachers on the same grade level have the same preparation periods allowing for planning lessons to meet the needs of the 
ELL children.  
The Principal belongs to several professional development organizations (Phi Delta Kappa, Association of Supervision 
Curriculum and Development, National Staff Development Council, National Association for the Education of Young Children, 
and the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics. These memberships allow the principal to share current research, 
books and best practices of instruction for ELL's. 
An ELL component is also integrated into our Election Day and Anniversary day professional development. Also within each 6 
week cycle of Monday professional development, there is an ELL PD.    
  Professional Development offered to teachers of ELL’s to meet the Common Core State Standards include Mini Institutes, 
Ready Gen and GoMath professional development.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 The ELL training for all staff is designed in a variety of ways: book studies, webinars, research articles etc. are distributed and 
discussed at grade meetings and staff conferences a minimum of three times during the school year, September 2017 to June 
2018. Each teacher receives a letter in their file to show attendance for conferences and workshops. On Mondays we have 
designated time for Professional Development which we use in a variety of ways to enhance our curriculum and improve 
curriculum and instruction.

Parental Involvement 

 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
At P.S. 175 the ENL teacher calls and meets with parents of ELL's during Tuesday afternoon "parent engagement" sessions. The 
ENL teacher keeps records of meetings and phone conferences in student files by using the "parent communication" form 
created by administration at P.S. 175. During the parent engagement meetings, the ENL teacher discusses progress for 
language development, assessment results and goals of the ENL program. The ENL teachers show parents the progress the 
students are making by sharing work done in class and assessments given. The ENL teachers share NYSESLAT results and 
explain how children are grouped according to language ability. During parent meetings the teachers give suggestions of how 
to work with the child. If a parent needs translation services there are many teachers at P.S. 175 that speak different languages 
that sit in on the meetings, if no one is available the Language and Interpretation unit is called and a translator is provided.  At 
P.S. 175 we have staff members who speak Russian, Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic, Mandarin, Cantonese and Italian. If staff 
members are not available to help with translation the Language and Interpretation Unit is called.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Newcomers are given information about child health insurance. Parents who have four year old children are given a list of Pre 
Kindergarten community based organizations. PS 175 Queens enrolls children in grades Pre-K- 5.  
Parent Association Meetings- Parents Association of PS 175 Queens schedules general membership meetings once a month. 
Parents receive a school wide flyer inviting all parents to attend. 
PS 175 “Meet and Greet”- is held in September as a way for parents to meet with their child’s teacher and learn about the 
school culture and classroom environment.  
ELL Parent Orientation Meetings several “ELL Newcomer” parent meetings are scheduled with language translators. At this 
meeting parents receive mandates NYC/DOE ENL documents and general “PS 175 Queens” information letters. Parents are 
able to ask questions about our school and learn about our school culture.  
NYSESLAT information sessions are held in the Spring before the NYSESLAT administration to make ELL parents aware of the 
exam and give them ideas on how to help their child do well. 
Parent Teacher Conferences- are scheduled in November and March. Parents are welcomed and encouraged to make 
additional appointments with teachers and or administrators as needed. Parent Field Trip Volunteers- parents participate in 
out of the school building cultural field trips. Students share that on a later date the entire family makes a return visit to the 
field trip location.  
Parent Informational Workshops – The parent coordinator in cooperation with teachers and administrators conduct several 
workshops; homework Help, How to Prepare for the NYS Exams.  
Parent Newsletter/Magazine- Pen and Ink are distributed to each child. This publication is distributed five times during the 
school year. It contains announcements, greetings from school administrators, information and class news from the teachers. 
Each grade at P.S. 175 writes a monthly newsletter to highlight important events, upcoming units of study. This is a valuable 
tool that keeps all parents at P.S. 175 informed. The newsletters are distributed to parents and hung on the bulletin board 
outside the main office for parents and visitors to see. 
Throughout the school year we hold many events that parents are invited too, such as Science Fair Night, Math Night, and 
Concerts for each grade.  
Kindergarten Open House – welcomes incoming Kindergarten students and their family members. 
Special Assembly Programs- parents are invited to attend “Tea with the Principal”, Parent Teacher Conferences, Holiday 
Celebrations: Grade 4 Thanksgiving Feast, Grade 3 Immigration Feast, Grade 2 Project Arts Presentation, Writing Celebrations: 
Monthly Writing Classroom Presentations and Shares, Spirit Day in the large school yard, many other special events and 
assembly programs. 
The Queens Library system partners with our school to sign up children and their family members with library cards. Students 
are encouraged to borrow books in their first language and borrow the “just right level book” in English. The local librarians are 
very helpful and knowledgeable. The local library, Jamaica Branch and Flushing Branch present workshops for “Newcomers" 
and free instructional classes in English as a Second Language and other multilingual services. 
The 108th Street Y partners with our school with the Parents Association After School Program. Families may enroll their 
children in the paid program that meets daily from 2:20 PM to 6:00 PM on Fridays and 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM Monday through 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 

Thursday.  
Forest Hills Community House partners with our school. Families may enroll their children in the paid after school program. 
 School staff members quickly work to establish a relationship between the school and home with all parents. Parents are 
introduced to the varied school personnel members from the security agent to the principal. Patterns have shown that the 
principal, assistant principal, parent coordinator, social worker and ESL teacher have been key contacts.  
The Parent Coordinator, social worker, and ENL teacher organize and conduct in school workshops, locate and distribute NYC 
and Community Based Organization brochures, distribute flyers, distribute announcements of District 28- district wide/city 
wide parent workshops like “Middle School Choice”.The parent involvement activities address ways that the newcomer 
parents can feel welcomed and become familiar with the daily routines of their child in the learning environment of Ps 175 
Queens. In addition the activities support the newcomer parents as they navigate New York City website and translated 
services.  
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
 We see our school as a learning community where all members, students, staff and parents support each other, address, accept 
and meet the needs of each student. We build an environment where learning, creativity and participation takes place, where all 
children feel safe and comfortable. The members of our learning community will be life- long learners, flexible and adaptable to 
change, responsible and accountable and will become active participants in our school and in our society. They will have long term 
goals, high self-esteem, and respect for themselves and others. The members of our learning community will develop decision 
making skills, critical thinking skills and the ability to communicate effectively. 
P.S.175 Queens, The Lynn Gross Discovery School is based on the proposition that children are seekers of meaning. Our mission is 
to supplement recitation with learning experiences that harness a child’s natural inquisitive nature to explore and discover. The 
Lynn Gross Discovery School engages children in investigations self-selected from age appropriate themes in natural science and 
social science. Our children are provided with opportunities to identify their interests and develop their multiple intelligences in a 
child centered, risk free atmosphere, which encourages cooperation, teamwork and respect for the individual. Independence, self-
reliance, confidence and the ability to identify and solve problems are anticipated outcomes for all of our students. We are a 
diverse, collaborative school community dedicated to achieving high standards of academic excellence for all our students. Parents 
are equal partners with the school in making all of our children life-long learners.  
The English Language Learner student must have every opportunity to be successful in the same way as the non-English Language 
Learner student has opportunities to learn. The Language Allocation Policy is one tool that helps reach this goal.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Patricia Cooper, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

When parents come to register their children at PS 175 they are greeted at the counter and asked to fill in some 
papers including a Home Language Identification Survey, which is provided in their native language where 
available. The ENL teacher helps fill in the HLIS and conducts an interview with the child. The parents are asked 
what language they prefer to be contacted in and when available, information is sent in the first 
language.According to the ATS Report, UPPG, most parents prefer to be notified in English, however, we do have 
notices available in Russian which is the language predominately spoken in the school community. If a parent has 
difficulty communicating in English, at PS 175 we are fortunate enough to have different staff members who 
speak different languages, including Russian, Hebrew, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Italian, Spanish and 
Arabic. If a parent indicates they want to be notified from the school in a different language, throughout the year 
we send home notifications in the preferred language and the parent is contacted by phone in the preferred 
language. When necessary the parent attends meetings with a team which includes a staff member or someone 
from the Department of Educations Translation Unit who speaks the preferred language. If there is a language

that we do not have a person who speaks, then we contact the Department of Educations Translation and 
Interpretation Unit for assistance. All ELL parent notification are also sent in the home language, and at the parent 
orientation for ELL's there are many people to translate the information into the different first languages. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

In the event of an emergency P.S. 175 will put out a school messenger message in English, Russian, Spanish, Chinese 
and Arabic. We will also put out a message on our school website in the various languages. We will also use the over 
the phone translation line to communicate with parents in case of an emergency.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

At P.S. 175 we have a diversified staff, many staff members including teachers, paraprofessionals and school based 
support team speak different languages. These key staff members are available when translation services are needed. 
If a staff member is not available or we do not have a staff member who speaks the parents language we call the 
Language and interpretation unit for an over the phone translation. We never use a child to translate. The Language 
Access Coordinator will hold a PD to make staff aware of different ways to talk to parents through translation services. 
LAC will show staff how to access over the phone translation and how to use the translation services to translate 
documents.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

When parents come into the school building there is a welcome poster, then they are greeted by the security guard 
who will see if they need translation services. If the parent needs translation they are escorted into the main office 
where a staff member who speaks their language is called and comes to translate. If a staff member is not available or 
the parent speaks a language that is unfamiliar to the staff, the Language Interpretation unit is called and a translator 
is used over the phone.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will use the standard New York City Department of Education official parent survey. The parent coordinator with 
the ENL teacher speak with parents on Tuesday afternoons. Parents are invited to visit the school and a staff 
translator is always available.
