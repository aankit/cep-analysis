Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and informed by New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement 
 
 
NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Implement at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify 

the instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content 
standards; provide time for collaboration on the use of) beginning no later than the 2018-19 school year. 

  Step 7: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 8: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 
Mission Statement 2018-19 - The Anne Hutchinson School is committed to working collaboratively with students, 
families and communities to build future leaders, and provide a safe and nurturing environment where all students 
meet and exceed high academic standards and personal goals. 

 
2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, including 

a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented. 

We are a Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 5 School, located in the northeast Baychester area of the Bronx. Our ninety year 
old building is well kept accommodating just over eight hundred thirty students and one hundred adults. As a strong 
collaborative learning community fully engaged in our school motto “Working Smarter for Student Success,” many 
teachers are currently serving as leaders, facilitators, academic intervention support and coaches. We are moving into 
our fourth year with our UFT Teacher Center, which has been a great resource, for the influx of new teachers hired 
and with DOE initiative - ULIT Coach working with teachers on Grades K-2 to increase the rigor of planning and 
instruction. Through Teacher Career Pathway opportunities, we move into our third year with our model classroom 
teachers who provide differentiated resources to identified grades and teachers. 

Our School Instructional Focus serves as our driving force to improving teacher practice and student learning: IF we 
consistently utilize our check for understanding techniques (questioning, retelling, one minute essay, think-pair-share, 
convince and observation etc.) and promote student ownership through rubric based feedback, THEN students will be 
able to use feedback to implement their next steps. We continue to participate in the District-wide initiative - 
Collaborative Visits involving groups of educators from partnering schools visiting classrooms taking low inference 
notes around our school instructional focus (Assessment and Feedback through the lens of Problem Solving). As a 
result of the IF Cohort visits, we have solidified four areas to deepen our work in Math Problem Solving: Problem 
solving exploration, differentiation: Effective use of the FUSE Strategy focusing on the needed area / Small groups, on-
going planning for misconceptions and content knowledge. Through our series of support and walkthroughs, we have 
created parallel and alternative instruction in all ICT classes, embedded Talk Moves across all subject areas and 
refined our monitoring and tracking sheets to immediately respond to student needs. 

A curriculum mapping team towards building coherence across grades and subjects have been formed to ensure 
consistency and transparency in pedagogical practices. Our work in the curriculum mapping project and planning 
rigorous lessons have allowed us to build on school initiatives: Junior Great (Shared Inquiry Approach), Leader in Me 
(Character Development) ESS (Leadership Support & Instructional Walkthroughs); Arts - Notes in Motion and CASA. 
We continue to embed our five common practices (Modeling, Team Talk / Turn and Talk, Evidence-Based Responses 
(EBR), Monitoring and Tracking and Student Feedback / Goal Setting) along with emphasizing checks for 
understanding, monitoring and tracking, feedback, student self-assessment, multiple entry points, equity and social 
emotional learning. This year we created varied structures to ensure a variety of collaborative learning opportunities, 
which included Special Education and English Language Learner Grade Team Collaborative sessions, Marvelous 
Monday, Tuesday Data Discussions, Core Inquiry and Grade Leaders. Through multiple formats of differentiated 
support (which include Study Groups – Learning communities), staff worked collaboratively to explore various 
strategies on increasing student engagement. Strong professional collaborations across grades enabled teachers to 
reflect and analyze student work leading to improved pedagogy and closing the gap in student achievement. 

We continue our efforts through Positive Behavior Intervention Support (PBIS) focusing on the whole child. Through 
Leader in Me (LIM), a character development model based on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. The 
Collaborative Planning Learning (CPL) team created Protocol for Giving Feedback – strategies and examples all staff 
members can utilize to allow students to be aware of their next steps for learning. We have set academic and 
personal goals with all students in order to gauge student progress, provide actionable and rubric based feedback. We 
will continue to utilize Habit 5 to promote our Equity Goal around social and emotional growth, placing a strong 
emphasis on Young Men of Color. Similarly to our Protocol for Giving Feedback, CPL Team also created samples of

students during conferencing sessions. Additionally, over the course of the summer, identified staff attended 
seminars and a retreat on how to build relationships and connect with students personally and socially. Currently we 
have adopted The Brain Power Classroom Program to build on our existing programs where teachers and students 
regulate their stress, increase concentration, building healthy minds through the 10 Essentials – Emotional Wellness, 
mindfulness, Team Building, Confidence, Focus, Physical Health etc. Our attendance data averages at a 91% which 
shows a slight drop in comparison to the City target (93%). However, when examined our chronic absenteeism rate is 
42.6. The school community is determined to see a decrease. Hence, specific measures are enforced: Overall 
absenteeism rate is tracked at the Beginning, Mid and End on our School Profile Sheet, Attendance Teacher 
consistently tracked daily and monthly attendance, attendance recorded is accessible to parents on Pupil Path, 
incentives are given to classes maintaining a monthly attendance rate of 90% or higher and individual students 
maintaining a monthly attendance rate of 100%. 

 

 
3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Overall school wide data indicates 28% Level 3 & 4 and 34% Level 1 students in ELA; 23% Levels 3 & 4 and 56% Level 1 
students in Math. ELA demonstrated a decrease of 1.4 (29.5 – 28.1) and Math a slight increase of 1.3 (22.2 – 23.5) 
from the previous year. Analysis of our Subgroups indicate minimal growth with our Hispanic / Latino and Student 
with Disabilities in comparison to our Black students. Our three year analysis (2015-2018) indicates an upward trend 
with our Black subgroup in ELA Level 3 & 4 (23-31) in comparison to our Hispanic / Latino (19-15); Students with 
Disabilities increased by 4% (4-8). There is however a good decline with our Level 1 data. Our Black subgroup indicates 
8% decrease (40-32); Hispanic / Latino with 10% decrease (53-43) and our Students with Disabilities with a 17% 
decrease (81-64). In Math, our Black subgroup indicates no movement with our Levels 3 & 4 (25-25); Hispanic / Latino 
5% increase (13-18) and Students with Disabilities 4% increase (8-12). Data also indicates an increase of Level 1 
students across all subgroups. After analysis of several data sources and looking at student work, some specific needs 
are but are not limited to: Reading, understanding and discussing complex texts (asking and answering questions to 
demonstrate understanding of a text referring explicitly to the text), application of vocabulary strategies and reading 
with sufficient accuracy and fluency to support comprehension, inability to apply grade-level phonics and word 
analysis skills in decoding words. In math, there is difficulty in deconstructing and solving multi-step word problems 
and word problems involving fractions. 

 
4.  Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over the 

past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools (FGS), in which our school made the most progress, over the past 
year, are Collaborative Teachers, Effective School Leadership and Supportive Environment specifically social 
emotional; receiving an average of 3.50 in the categories. Learning Environment Survey data reveals an upward trend 
in social emotional score (2.55 to 4.57). As a result of the low score of 2.55, a team was created to survey teachers via 
Survey Monkey three times per year honing in on specific questions under various sub-heading. During each cyclical 
data review, survey responses were analyzed and discussed. For example: One of the questions asked when thinking 
about social emotional, how strongly you feel that a lot of adults at the school recognize disruptive behavior as social-
emotional learning opportunities. In 2016-2017 school received a score of 71%. This year our score increased 27% (71-
98%). We will continue to look closely at each sub-heading and utilize Survey Monkey to sustain and guide our work in 
the identified areas. 

Data from the FGS Report indicates a score of 2.94 – Rigorous Instruction. Through the Instructional Focus 
Collaborative Cohort visits in Math, we continue to build and refine on our existing initiatives (planning for 
Misconceptions, incorporating Multiple Entry Points, “on the spot” adjustments). As a result of our progress, we have 
deepened our instructional focus in the area of assessment and feedback in Math Problem solving allowing more 
opportunities for students to engage in the assessment cycle: IF we consistently utilize check for understanding 
techniques (Questioning, Retelling, One Minute Essay, Think-Pair-Share, Convince Me & Observation etc.) and 
promote student ownership through rubric based feedback, THEN students will be able to use feedback to implement 
their next steps. It is now evident that students are problem solving and exploring. Our school community has

solidified four areas based on our intra-visitations and school visits: Problem solving exploration, Differentiation: 
Effective use of the FUSE Strategy focusing on the needed area / Small groups, On-going planning for misconceptions, 
Engaging adults in Math content. Based on our End of Year data review, i-Ready data indicates that we met our 
overall target in Math with a 22% increase (8-30%). There is a steady decline in overall Tier 3: this year a 24% decrease 
(43-19) and last year 17% decrease (44-27). We continue to close the achievement gap in Numbers & Operation (34% 
vs. 28% increase last year). 

 

5.  Identify at least one USDE Turnaround Principle (e.g., redesign the school day, week, or year; modify the 

instructional program to ensure it is Evidence-based, rigorous, and aligned with State academic content standards; 
provide time for collaboration on the use of data) to be implemented in the 2018-19 school year. 

Through our Collaborative Planning Learning Team, we have strategically outlined our monthly professional 
development sessions which include allotted time for Curriculum Refinement. Schedules for our Marvelous Monday 
and Tuesday Time was discussed with staff and posted. 

~1st Monday – Whole Group Session 

~2nd & 3rd Monday – Curriculum Refinement Process 

~4th Monday – Study Group Session (Professional Learning Communities) 

~Tuesday Time – Data & Inquiry Sessions 

On Mondays & Tuesdays Professional Development opportunities include working sessions with grade and content 
area teams using Curriculum Mapping Refinement and Pacing Calendars. This process is used to determine standards 
and entry points, student misunderstanding and components of the programs to be addressed. To date, teams have 
identified specific units and or topics from our core programs to unpack over the course of the year to deepen 
student understanding with identified anchor standards. 

Also, our Math initiative - embedding Math Exemplar – problem solving activities daily through our five day protocol 
and our Math Team have allowed more emphasis on small group instruction, exploration tasks which enabled 
teachers to plan and address misconceptions. To increase adult content, we have created and executed math 
boosters during staff meetings. We also have partnered with Algebra for All instituting departmentalization on Grade 
5.

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Our 2017-18 ELA and Math State results reveal an overall decrease of 1.4% (29.5 – 28.1) in ELA and an overall increase 
of 1.3% (22.2-23.5) in Math. Grade 3 students made good progress in both areas: ELA 12% increase (20-32) in Level 3 & 
4 and 32 % decrease (50-27) in Level 1; Math 7% increase (20-27) in Level 3 & 4 and 4% decrease in Level 1. When 
comparing iReady ELA cyclical data from the previous year, we are closing the gap in overall reading with a 17% increase 
(15-32) vs 15% (16-31), in phonics 19% increase (32-51) vs 17% (25-42) and vocabulary 13% increase (17-30) vs. 17% (12-
29) the previous year. Our cyclical data for Fountice & Pinnell, Diagnostic Writing Assessment and Math Exemplar Tasks 
indicate good progress as well. F & P Cycle 1 to Cycle 3 data indicated 72% to 53% Below or Far Below and 28% to 46% 
Meeting or Exceeding. DWA Assessment indicated large percentages of students making progress in the areas of 
Structure, Development and Transition. However, there is a need to continue working with Anchor Standards 1, 2, 3 and 
4 (cite specific text evidence and inferences; central ideas or themes; analyzing the text; vocabulary). When comparing 
iReady Math cyclical data from previous year, there was a 2% increase (25-27) in Algebra & Algebraic Thinking. Our work 
with Math Exemplar from January through May 2018 indicated 74 to 55% Level 1 & 2 and 26 to 44% Level 3 & 4. 
Problem Solving - 57 to 40% Level 1 & 2 and 43 to 60% Level 3 & 4. Communication - 72 to 54% Level 1 & 2 and 28 to 
46% Level 3 & 4. However 40% of our students are below standard in Problem Solving and 50% below standard in 
Communication. Based on our Item Analysis and Periodic Assessment data from last year, we need to hone in on the 
standards Operations and Algebraic (OA) Thinking, as well as, Number and Base ten (NBT). 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          16 

 

In addition to our effort to use a variety of teaching strategies such as open-ended questions - Hess Matrix, reference 
charts, graphic organizers, rubrics, excerpts of student work, text annotation, visualization, vocabulary study, 
differentiated text, and routines such as partner / Team Talk and strategic grouping, providing opportunities for active 
participation for identified subgroups and group of students. 

To provide a comprehensive approach responsive to student needs, we will implement our school instructional focus 
(around assessment and feedback) with fidelity by: 1) Setting goals in order to gauge student progress, provide 
actionable and rubric based feedback and adjust curricula and instruction through multiple points of entry, learning 
activities and misconceptions. 2) Checking for student understanding using formative and summative assessments to 
immediately respond to student data across classrooms. 3) Consistently implement our agreed upon practices, check for 
understanding techniques and feedback strategies across grades and subjects. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, as measured by the Universal Screening Tool – I-Ready, in the areas of Phonics, Vocabulary and 
Information Comprehension and Math (Number & Operation and Algebraic Thinking) – there will be a 20% increase in 
ELA & 25% in Math on the overall percentage of our cyclical data analysis in the identified areas.)

Our Equity goal allowed us to build on our leadership habits, support our Young Men of Color and deepen our 
knowledge around social emotional learning towards improving school climate his initiative utilizes Habit 5 (seeking first 
to understand then to be understood). It aims at enhancing student learning and provides consistency in students 
creating, monitoring and tracking of their academic and personal. This initiative has allowed us to create an Equity Team 
comprised of e supervisors, classroom teachers, Dean and Guidance. Through our monthly Equity Team, each classroom 
teacher, support staff and other school personnel has adopted three boys for the purpose of mentoring. Teachers guide 
student in creating, monitoring and tracking of their academic and personal goals via the leadership folders. Student 
leaders have the opportunity to reflect on their progress towards mastery and set new goals on “Reflection Fridays”. 

 

Our OORS (Report Occurrence Reporting System) Data Index indicates a score of 2.63 in comparison to the City average 
of 2.97. However, data reveals a 4% increase in Level 3 and 8% increase in Level 4 infractions, as well as, concerns with 
school attendance rate (90.4). As a result, the goal of our Attendance Committee and school community is to reduce the 
chronic absenteeism rate by 10%. The Attendance Committee will: 

  Match chronically absent students to mentors

  Provide families with real-time attendance data along with an action plan for improvement. While family 

engagement is crucial at all levels, it is particularly important in the lower grades. Many parents do not see the 
impact of their child's attendance prior to high school on their futures 
Intensify incentive plans to include monthly activities 

 

Our school will continue to utilize our coordinated efforts (School Tone, Equity and Crisis Team) toward social emotional 
development to eliminate barriers to student learning and increase student attendance. We continue to build on our 
Leader in Me whole-school transformation process creating a culture of student empowerment. Greater emphasis is on 
the implementation of our school-wide initiative focused on providing more support and development of the social-
emotional well-being of our students. We have mapped out a series of professional Development sessions geared 
towards equipping teachers with the necessary tools to effectively address the social emotional needs of all students. 
Staff members have participated in a variety of professional development sessions some of which included “Equity vs. 
Equality”, “The Five Competencies of Social Emotional Learning”, video Presentation - “Every Child Needs a Champion”. 
Currently, our partnership with Brain Power Classroom, a program which promotes physical, emotional and cognitive 
intelligence. Students and staff will participate in on going workshops in which they engage in exercises, breathing 
techniques and meditations aimed at improving focus, managing stress, build confidence and increase mindfulness and 
movement. We have instituted monthly Social Emotional Learning (SEL) tip to help staff further address students’ social 
emotional needs.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As we closely analyze the June Instructional Focus and the Item Skills Analysis (ISA) honing in on the Constructive 
Responses (Writing to Sources), overall across all grades in ELA (3-5) when compared to the city, we are performing 
lower than the city. Analysis shows: Strengths - Grade 3: Determine the main idea of a text; recount details in response 
to writing (RL 3.2) & Refer to parts of stories, when writing or speaking about a text (RL 3.5). Grade 4: Determine the 
meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text (RL 4.4) & Compare and contrast the point of view from which 
different stories (RL 4.6). Grade 5: Compare and contrast two or more characters, settings, or events in a story or drama, 
drawing on specific details in the text (RL 5.3) & Describe how a narrator’s or speaker’s point of view influences how 
events are described (RL 5.6). Next Steps – Grade 3: Describe logical connections between particular sentences and 
paragraph in a text (RL 3.8). Grade 4: Determine a theme of a story, drama, or poem from details in the text; summarize 
the text (RL 4.2) & Explain events, procedures, ideas including what happened and why based on specific information in 
the text (RL 4.3). Grade 5: Compare and contrast overall structures of events, ideas or concepts in two or more texts (RL 
5.5) & Determine a theme of a story, details in the text, including how characters in a story respond to challenges or 
how the speaker in a poem reflects upon a topic; summarize the text (RL 5.2).  

As we further analyze our Diagnostic Writing Assessment (DWA), school wide data reveals an increase in score from 
beginning to the end. Categories such as Structure, Development, Organization averaging at an Approaching level (2.1) 
across grades. As a result, school will focus on Writing looking closely at:

Short Response Questions (Reading) RI.1, RI.2: Demonstrates accurate understanding of the text (when applicable, 
states accurate main idea) 

Reasoning and Support (W.1.B) : Develops logical reasons that support opinion and refers to information from the texts 

Organization and Transitions W.1.C, W.1.A: Creates an organizational structure that lists reasons / group related ideas 
together and Uses transitional words and phrases to link opinion and reasons 

As we reflect on Pedagogy (1.2), greater emphasis will be on the use of differentiated instruction that is more 
responsive to student, use of ongoing checks for understanding (rubric-based) and student self-assessment. Our overall 
Instructional next steps will be on Building Teacher Practice, looking at standards and reviewing components within the 
standards mirroring the State exam questions, analysis of Performance tasks (Unit Tasks, MOSL) to inform instruction 
and student groups and opportunities for frequent on demand tasks.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal  

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

Consider each Statement of Practice (SOP) below, and identify at least one.  Place an “X” in the 
appropriate box indicating SOP(s) addressed in this action plan. 
2.2  The school leader ensures that the school community shares the Specific, Measurable, 

Ambitious, Results-oriented, and Timely (SMART) goals/mission and long-term vision inclusive 
of core values that address the priorities outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP). 
Leaders make strategic decisions to organize programmatic, human, and fiscal capital 
resources. 

2.3 

2.4  The school leader has a fully functional system in place aligned to the district's Annual 

Professional Performance Review (APPR) to conduct targeted and frequent observation and 
track progress of teacher practices based on student data and feedback. 

2.5  Leaders effectively use evidence-based systems and structures to examine and improve 

critical individual and school-wide practices as defined in the SCEP (student achievement, 
curriculum and teacher practices; leadership development; community/family engagement; 
and student social and emotional developmental health).

Part 1b.  Needs/Areas of Focus: 
Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the SOP(s) selected above and the 
most current summative and formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources 
should include but are not limited to the Integrated Intervention Team Review, Central-led Review, Quality Review, 
NYSED Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness Self-Reflection, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School 
Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. Number responses accordingly. 
 

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and 

year. 

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Supervisors continue to conduct frequent cycles of classroom visits, followed by actionable feedback, focusing on 
Component 1e (Designing Coherent Instruction), 3c (Engaging Students in Learning) and 3d (Using Assessment in 
Instruction). We continue to utilize multiple formats of differentiated support where staff works collaboratively to 
explore various strategies to enhance student engagement. As a result of supervisory walkthroughs, regular class visits, 
lesson plan reviews and ADVANCE data, there is been noted improvement in consistency and transparency of 
pedagogical practices. Targeted professional development session were provided which included specific checks for 
understanding techniques, self and peer assessment, the feedback protocol, setting personal goals and the revised 
monitoring and tracking sheet. ADVANCE data indicates a need to continue in identified areas (coherent instruction, 
engagement, assessment) with emphasis on student discussion. Although, we continue to close the gap in pedagogical 
practices across grades, subjects and disciplines; teaching practices do not translate to accelerated growth in student 
achievement. Our school subgroup data indicates a wider gap in both areas for Black (ELA-31%; Math-25%), Hispanic 
(ELA-15%; Math-18%) and SwD’s (ELA-12%; Math-8%) suggesting the need for consistent systems in place to decrease 
the gap. Greater consistency is required in the effective utilization of assessments to form small groups providing 
targeted, differentiated instruction for cohort of students with similar needs. School leaders will place a stronger 
emphasis on the instructional focus (assessment and feedback), utilizing cyclical data to hold ongoing data conferences 
honing in on progress of identified subgroups (Black, Hispanic, Students w Disabilities).

Our school is deliberate and strategic in strengthening the bond between home and school. Over the past three years 
we have placed stronger emphasis on improving parental involvement. This year the NYC School Survey parent 
participation rate rose to 99% in comparison to previous years ranging 50-60%. This has propelled us to invest in the use 
of various tools to reach and connect with our families in an attempt to improve student performance. Some of the 
tools being used include a School App, Pupil Path, Class Dojo, monthly calendars in English and Spanish, tentative annual 
calendar included in the Parent Handbook, parent interest survey, monthly PTA meetings, parent workshops and special 
flyers notifying parents about school events. Based on data collected from the School Quality Guide 2017-2018, 90% of 
parents/guardians agreed or strongly agreed that they feel well-informed by the communication they receive from their 
child’s school. We consistently communicate high expectations through our school instructional focus, Mission, Vision & 
Shared Values, strong emphasis on student engagement, data driven instruction and SCEP goals. We have implemented 
various ways to build family and community ties and strong emphasis on student engagement. Some initiatives that we 
have undertaken are: 

Leader in Me (LIM) Activities: LIM Booster Shot, a 5 – 10 minute icebreaker before the start of PD sessions 

 
  PS 78 School App which support our effort to keep families aware of all the events happening at the school. 
  Hosting a series of Parent Informational and Engagement sessions that support students in being prepared for 

college, and career readiness. Parents were engaged in a series of morning workshops with our CEI Consultants:

After careful analysis of our Parent Activity Log (PAL), we soon realized that there are specific activities that 
increase our parent attendance: 

  Parent Open House (196); Dads Take Your Child to School (115); Donuts with Dads (163); World Read Aloud Day 

Celebration (91); Muffins with Moms (200); Notes in Motion (77); Family Game Night (100)

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP) 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Anne Hutchinson School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

●actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;

inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

●conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home; 

provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State accountability 
system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, Learning 
Environment Survey Report; 

●host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”

Begin description here:            
Begin description here:   
Rationale: 
PS 78  After School  and Saturday Classes programs will provide additional academic and 
linguistic support to our ELL students. The rationale for holding the program is the low 
performance of ELL students as documented on the NYSESLAT report: 61 Student Tested. Of 
the 50 returning students - Entering 8%,  Emerging 26%, Transitioning 38%, Expanding 24% 
and Commanding 4%.  
All ELL students  in grades 1-5 will receive invitations to attend. The supplementary programs 
will focus on:  vocabulary, comprehension and language development in the content areas of 
English Language Arts and Mathematics.  The targeted groups are ELL students in grades 3-5 
who will be taking the NYS ELA test in the spring as well as students in Grade 1-2. All ELL 
students in grades 1-5 will receive invitations to participate in both programs. Subgroups and 
grade levels of students to be served:  Grades 2, 3, 4 and 5 students were identified based on the 
data:  NYSESLAT, ELA , Math tests and I-Ready Beginning of the Year Assessments.  
Schedule and duration: ELL students will have the opportunity to attend After School Program. 
Sessions will be held focused on providing support using the Imagine Learning Program in 
addition to classroom instruction. The After School schedule is  Wednesday and Thursday from 
2:45-5:15 P.M. and will begin in November, for a total of 32 sessions. To provide the most 
efficient instruction during the After School pending student enrollment, students will be 
grouped based on Performance and grade levels with a Common Branch & ENL Teacher.  For 
example, Entering and Emerging students will be grouped in one class across grades 2 & 3 with 
a a common branch teacher and grades 4 & 5 with another common branch teacher. The certified 
ENL teacher will rotate in each of the content teacher class for 45 minutes in the After school 
program. In addition to the after school programs, a myON session on Fridays will occur from 
November – March. This totals 15 sessions. The program hours are 2:45 PM – 3:45 PM. We are 
aware that might exceed the allotted funds. Hence, the school will complement the cost of the 
program using other funding source.  At each session there is one teacher to reinforce and 
provide  access of the English Language at no cost to Title III Language of instruction:  English 
# and types of certified teachers:  Total of 3 support staff 
1 Certified ENL teacher and 2 General Education teachers for both programs (After school). 
During the After School Program, ENL Teacher will co-teach with content teacher during the 
whole group  
component then rotate from cohort group of students providing targeted lessons based on IReady 
data. All records such as student attendance and assessment will be kept on file in a Title III 
Program Binder. 
Materials: iReady, Imagine Learning, and myON Digital Reading. Students will receive direct 
instruction utilizing iReady as a resource for small group instruction.

Begin description here:            
 Rationale: 
Many of our students speak a language  other than English in their home, and  therefore, we 
consider all teachers in our school  as teachers for English Language Learners. As such, we 
provide various opportunities to participate in our school focus of differentiated instruction for 
professional development. 
Resources include ESS support (package purchased to provide additional support as well as, the 
NYCDOE Division of English  Language Learner and Student Support. During  our  mandated 
Professional Development sessions classroom teachers receive site-based staff development 
through out the course of the year in core curricula from school-based coaches, support staff and 
consultants.  All PD sessions  are aligned to the identified needs of  all students including our 
ELLs. There are on-going opportunities  for  teachers and instructional staff to discuss, review 
and analyze  assessment data and student work as well.  During these sessions staff continues to 
be exposed to research in second language learning acquisition, best practices for ELL students 
and techniques to improve communication between home and school.   Topics that will cover 
through out the year are  ELL identification process, mandated services and analysis of data 
honing in on the ELL population and NYSSELAT data. Professional workshops conducted  by 
consultants  will be provided throughout the school calendar year as well. The staff  involved 
with Title III are trained in ENL techniques and methodologies by the ENL teacher, Assistant 
Principal, and representatives from our BFSC  who offer additional ENL Professional 
Development sessions as per CR Part 154 mandates. 
Our Professional Development opportunities will include:- Site based on-going  differentiated

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
  Rationale: 
It is our school's goal to increase parental involvement.  Parents of ELL students are invited to 
attend all activities provided by the Parent Coordinator and Parent-Teacher Association.  In 
addition, they are invited to attend school performances and class celebrations, which are held 
every six to eight weeks, also, all local and citywide events. Parents are also encouraged to 
attend parent teacher conferences and school trips. For the school year our ELL parents will be 
invited to attend two workshops  during our Saturday Classes program; the sessions will be two 
and a half hours and focused on helping ELL parents support their children's learning, as well as, 
develop their own literacy skills. During the sessions, The ENL teacher will work with the Parent 
Coordinator and Instructional Coaches to provide an overview of the school's core curriculum 
and web based intervention programs highlighting the specific tools used to support ELL 
students. The session will be interactive where parents will participate in actual lessons and 
activities, as well as, practice using the web based programs. The sessions will provide 
information regarding local resources available providing adult literacy from our Parent 
Coordinator and representatives from partnership providing such services.  The Parent 
Coordinator will also act to assist with addressing the needs of our ELL parents, as well as, 
helping to inform parents about sponsored events. All parents are notified by mail, distribution of 
fliers and parent monthly calendar in their native language. ELL students also participate in Arts 
Initiative at P.S. 78. Notes and Motion is focused on dance and the CASA Inside Broadway 
initiative focused on singing, acting and dancing. The expectation is that ELL students will 
receive additional support with developing language skills through their participation in these 
programs.  The needs of our ELL parents are determined through parent surveys and 
questionnaires, feedback during PTA meetings, parent participation on our school's leadership 
team, direct contact with school's Parent Coordinator and meetings and phone conversations with 
teachers.Translation services are provided through the LAC coordinator.  The LAC coordinator, 
secretaries and Parent Coordinator are all bi-lingual and can provide Spanish translation. All 
school notices and other pertinent written communication are translated into Spanish using and 
any other identified languages, using resources from the LTI unit. In addition, the staff includes a 
school aide who is fluent in French and Haitian Creole.  She is able to translate for parents as

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The data our school uses to assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs includes data from the iReady (ELA & Math), Fountas and 
Pinnell, Diagnostic Writing Assessment, ELA Benchmark. We have mapped out our Testing Schedule which includes F & P, 
IReady and DWA to be administered  3X per year in cycle. In addition, teachers utilize data from the NYSITELL, Imagine 
Learning, ELL Periodic Assessment, teacher conference notes and observations. The data from student assessments helps us 
determine the needs of ELLs, strengths, and next steps for each grade. Teachers develop units of study that integrate 
modalities of listening, speaking, writing, and reading. The unit plans focus in all content areas and around Global themes that 
provide students with an assessment experience that is cohesive and interconnected across each of the modalities.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

The structures that PS 78 have in place to support this effort are 
* having school wide inquiry teams 
* grade level teams and curriculum teams where teachers discuss the work/assessment and plan accordingly to support the 
student’s based on their needs. 
               * After administering one of these assessments, for example the Diagnostic Writing Assessment, the teachers will 
discuss                 the progress made by students, and plan together to support the students on where they need the most 
support.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 Success of our ELL program is evaluated by studying longitudinal trends for the ELLs we serve in order to determine if students 
are making progress in terms of the English language acquisition (e.g., NYSESLAT), NYC Performance Based Tasks or through 
the New York State Testing Program for students in grades 3-5 who are testing in English for more than one year. During 
Inquiry, Teacher team, Monday PD’s, and/or grade meetings teachers meet together to discuss final results and prepare for 
the future. Some of the summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments being used to identify baseline, progress 
and areas of need are “Go math”, “EOY Math” , “I-Ready”, “Fountas & Pinnell”, “Reading Steps”, “Fundations”, “Diagnostic 
Writing Assessment (DWA)”, “ECLAS”. We also use the ELA, Math and NYSESLAT exams, which are pending at the moment.      
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The structures that PS 78 have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered is provide 
students with additional support if needed, taking into consideration evidence such as “Results on the annual English language 
proficiency assessment exam”, “Sample of student work in English and, if the student has or is suspected of having a 
disability”, “Number of years of instruction in a bilingual education or English as a new language program”, “Content area and 
socio-emotional support needs of students with inconsistent/interrupted formal education (SIFE)”, “ English and home 
language literacy needs of long-term ELLS”, “Content area teacher and English as a second language teacher 
recommendation”, “English and home language literacy”, and “Parent or guardian request”. These support services provided 
are aligned to our intervention plans (Academic intervention services) the school is already providing to all students. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
The data that is used to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework for grades K-5 are as 
follows:Three times a year, our school uses an universal screening (i- Ready) to show growth for all our students including ELLs 
in Literacy.  This year we will mirror the same process for Math utilizing i-Ready.  This screening shows students' levels in order 
to help teachers adjust, design and develop the work according to their levels. The classroom teachers also use F & P Running 
Record Data, previous NYC Performance Based Tasks (MOSL) and Performance Base Assessment Tasks taken from the core 
programs - Ready Gen and Go Math at the end of each unit.  From these results, teachers are able to monitor and track how 
their students are performing. Results are then analyzed. Appropriate actions are taken if there is a continuous decrease 
or  stagnancy. For example: Targeted small groups within the classroom. If the need arises, identified students are scheduled 
for AIS Support (Our push in / pull out model)  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Analysis of the 2017 NYSESLAT (ELL Data Analysis) indicates low performance in the writing modality. Based on the individual 
student report and identified levels, students are grouped accordingly. According to the NYSESLAT ELA and Math comparison, 
students proficiency Levels (TR, EM, EN, EX) vary across the Levels (Levels 1-4) in each subject area.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The structures that PS 78 have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to the programs are 
analysis of EDAT at ELL Meetings, group students accordingly to their proficiency levels and ensured students are programmed 
in STARS. Such programming allows for more in-depth small group instruction based on the push in / pulls out model. Students

across grades with similar proficiency levels are seen via push in/ pull out honing in on an identified need based on the 
Individual Report Sheet.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The Principal, Assistant Principal and the ENL teacher meets on a monthly basis with the designated ELL classroom 
teachers to discuss and analyze continuity of our ELL's instruction.  ELL instruction is delivered primarily by the 
school's ENL teacher with support from identified classrooms on each grade.  The organizational models used at PS 78 
is integrated and stand-alone ENL. The stand-alone model facilitates the plan for academic language development in 
content areas, as the strategies being taught in the grade level classroom will be reinforced by the ENL teacher within 
our balanced literacy instructional model.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

2.  While working within the construct of this model, the ENL teacher utilizes methodologies and approaches recommended 
for our language learners such as, total physical response and language experience approach.  Instruction is focused around 
the building wide focus Using Evidence in Argument and Discussion as well as the instructional shifts of the Common 
Core.  Focusing on the instructional shifts provide support with academic vocabulary, providing text based answers, writing 
from sources and staircase of text complexity.  These approaches are supported with a variety of technology (computers, i-
pads, personal audio recorders, etc).The  standalone ENL model utilizes a primarily homogeneous grouping of students with 
the same proficiency levels in one group via a push in / pull out services.  ELL students are placed in designated classes. For 
example, all the '02' classes on grades 1-3 are ELL classes & '01' on grades 4 & 5.The student's proficiency levels are based on 
the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT results.  For our ELL and former ELL students who have exited after two years of ELL status will 
continue to receive a minimum number of units of integrated ENL.    
 
2a.  In our integrated model, the ENL teacher delivers 360 instructional minutes with two units of study in ENL/ELA for entering 
and emgering students.  For transitioning students, .5 unit of study in ENL/ELA and one unit of study for expanding students in 
ENL/ELA.  In supporting the units of study, our ENL teacher provides modeling, students practice and work independently 
while teacher roves and conferences.- The EDAT and RLAT provides information about the students, the NYSESLAT grades and 
the student's level.  The teacher will also identify where do the students' need the most support, and help them accordingly 
with the mandated minutes.               
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

All ENL curricula are CCLS aligned and focus on both fiction and non-fiction texts. Our current ELL data reveals that ELL 
students struggle most with writing in response to reading. Hence, one of our five Common Practices (Modeling - I do, We do 
& They do) along with our workshop mode ( Whole-Small- Whole)  is seen across grades while utilizing the Writing Framework. 
For example, on a given day, the ENL teacher would work with a small group of students during the modeling and target his / 
her group during the small group component. In addition, All students are engaged in our Independent Reading Block while 
the classroom teacher conferences with 2-3 students and or meets with a guided or strategy group. . Instructional approaches 
used to scaffold the curricula includes think-pair-share, backwards design analysis, graphic organizers, task analysis, vocabulary 
building strategies, annotation and Turn and Talk.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The ENL coordinator evaluates the level of literacy in the students’ home language by administering the Spanish LAB if 
students are newly matriculated into the NYC DOE and scores are then recorded. If students are not new to the NYC DOE, the 
Spanish LAB is administered for reference only and to evaluate the student’s home language literacy skills against the correct 
answers on the test. Based on student Home Language survey, Math exam is ordered in student preferred language with 
accommodation from DOE approved interpreters. LAC ensures that all school personnel have access to the translation unit.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

5a.   
SIFE students who are enrolled in our school  participate in all school based programs.  Differentiated instruction consists of 
designing lessons based on students' learning style and assess students' learning using formative assessments.  All lessons 
would  be continually assessed and adjusted to meet students' need. 
 
 5b. 
Newcomers:  Instruction of ELLs is differentiated based upon the individual needs of students.  The new students at PS 78 are 
given opportunities to work independently as well as working cooperatively with peers.  All ELLs are offered the opportunity to 
participate in school based After School Program and Saturday classes.  The programs provide support in math and 
literacy.  Homework assistance is provided and independent reading is encouraged to support our instructional focus Using 
Evidence in Argument and Discussion.   In addition, ELL students expected to participate in the ELA testing (after one year of 
English Language Instruction) in grades 3, 4, and 5 will have the opportunity to participate in our school's Saturday Test 
Preparation Program, beginning January and culminating in April to address grade specific needs in reading, writing,  listening 
and math.  A wide range of materials are used to support instruction such as visual aids, manipulative (particularly to reinforce 
letter-sound relationships), big books, vocabulary cards, various word study activity kits and texts with audio supplement.  This 
year, all students will be reading independently for daily (5X for 30 minutes) in addition to the Literacy Block.  
5c. 
Developing: Ell students are supported in their literacy skills as well as their skills in English language acquisition.  Individualized 
intervention plans are developed to support their academic success.  The students work more in the area of writing and it 
includes: exploring text organization, developing complex sentences, integrating the teaching of language skills with subject 
matter content and expanding range of vocabulary through root and affix analysis.  We also offer the ELL students a computer 
based program, IMAGINE LEARNING ENGLISH PROGRAM.  Our ELL population will access this program on a daily basis for 20 
minutes.  The program provides individual instruction and monitoring in the areas of phonemic awareness, vocabulary, 
listening skills and reading comprehension. Here students can listen and read along a story they have selected.  Words are 
highlighted as they read. 
 5d. 
 Long Term ELLs:  Long term ELLs continue to receive academic support through small group intervention, After School and 
Saturday School programs. These identified students receive support to ensure academic progress is made.  5e. Former ELLs: 
Our former ELLs have access to 90 minutes of Literacy Block, all educational supplementary programs such as extended time 

2018-19 SCEP-FF                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

for testing, after school programs and Saturday Academy classes.  
 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 ELL Students with Disabilities are integrated with the general education ELL population during mandated minutes using the 
core curriculum which consists of the Ready Gen and Go Math programs.  The ENL teacher will have a copy of the IEP for each 
child, to help understand their learning needs.  In addition, ELL special needs students who continue to have significant 
difficulty in area of encoding and decoding, will participate in small group instruction, Fundations (K-2),  vocabulary 
development, re-wording instructions-breaking them down into simple steps, just right books on child's level, graphic 
organizers, SMART boards, audio and visual aids, and RTI strong Tier 1 high quality instruction. Teachers utilize several check 
for understanding strategies where instructors monitor students throughout each lesson in order to ensure academic growth. 
Students have access have to glossaries, work with Fundations daily, Imagine Learning, and i-Ready.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school is part of the Special Education Reform to support our ELLs and SWDs.  We offer ICT classes presently on grades 
First, Second, Third, and Fifth grade.  We also offer SETTS services to students in general education and flexible scheduling 
where students have the opportunity to be mainstreamed for certain subjects.  Furthermore, our Response To Intervention 
(RTI) Committee meets weekly to discuss and review identified students and provide research based instruction and 
interventions that address the individual, linguistic, and academic needs of our students.  The curriculum that is used is aligned 
with General Education using Imagine Learning and technology programs that are differentiated to address the different 
learning styles (visuals, tactile, auditory, kinesthetic learning styles.)   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our target intervention program focuses on our intermediate ELLs who are not meeting goals of passing NYS exams across the 
curriculum nor advancing NYSESLAT scores. Repeater classes taught by certified teachers in all content areas are offered 
during regularly scheduled school hours and focus on scaffolding curriculum with graphic organizers, think-pair-share, and 
backwards analysis (modeling). A connection with real life application for each content area is stressed. These classes are 
geared to long term ELLs however ELLs with 1-3 years of service across proficiency levels will benefit from these intervention 
courses as well.  The Title III money is also used to offer intervention services for ELLs who want to meet personal goals or who 
are struggling with academic language. The science, math and ENL teacher are available for small group tutoring after school 
through Title III tutoring hours. Trips will be made available to all ELLs and are used as motivational, hands-on and real world 
tools that add to our curriculum here at P.S. 78.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

IImprovements in our program happen every year. We will continue to implement common preparation periods this year 
where the ENL teacher can plan differentiated lessons and ENL strategies to increase rigor and student engagement. During 
our Independent Reading Block students will be exposed to a variety of texts while classroom teacher and ENL teacher 
conference with students.  
  
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We will be adding to ELLs programs and services. We will not be removing any services for ELLs. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are provided with the same opportunities to participate in school based After School and Saturday classes with 
targeted support.  All students are invited to join and participate in all curricular and extracurricular programs with an effort

made by all teachers and parents to encourage the students to participate. In addition, our school is part of the "Project Read 
Program" for First graders.  The program provides 1:1 tutoring. Under supervision, high school students read with children, 
provide homework assistance and use a prescribed phonics program.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELL students will be utilizing the web based computer programs such "Imagine Learning English", "Learning A-Z",  “i-Ready” 
and JiJi.  In addition, the ENL teacher has access to, but not limited to, the Rigby Reading Program, ELL Intervention Kits, and 
"Preparing for the NYSESLAT and Beyond".  The ELL students are also given access to books and magazines in their native 
language to support each child's continued academic growth. Lessons in Science and Social Studies are made as "hands-on" as 
possible, posters, videos, illustrated books, partner interviews, glossaries, dictionaries, group projects and include 
experiments, school trips and a variety of tactile experiences meant to support all learners including ELLs in our 
classrooms.  Smart boards are in grades K-5 classrooms and enable teachers to easily incorporate visual and auditory cues in 
their lesson that in turn, more fully support our ELLs vocabulary and concept acquisition.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

All our ELL classrooms have multi cultural libraries,  glossaries, dictionaries, literature and illustrated big books in their native 
language, visual cues, posters, games and songs.   The ELL classrooms also provide cooperative learning giving our ELL students 
an opportunity to think/pair and share with other students.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Our required services for our ELLs are arranged around proficiency level and grade level.  If a great disparity between levels of 
language acquisition occurs between one or more students in a given class or on a given grade, care is taken to reschedule that 
students to be included in the ENL instruction in another grade or with another group (working at a more appropriate 
level).  The rescheduling will only be for one 50 minute instructional period, making sure that students are working with the 
ENL teacher during their second period of instructional time which focuses on grade appropriate content.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
We are planning to invite the newly enrolled ELL students and their parents to our school "Share Fair", held at the end of May, 
where both parents and students will have an opportunity to see and visit what our school offers throughout the year in all 
subject areas.   For those students and parents who are unable to attend this fair, they will also be invited to attend our Open 
House in June which will offer many resources for the families. Newly enrolled ELLs will be assigned to a buddy on their own 
grade for easy transition and adjustment. During the Family Night session, ENL Coordinator will also meet with newly ELL 
parents and students as a group. Group will tour the building and meet the staff. 
  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Our school does not provide language electives to our ELLs as we are an elementary school.      
     
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Ms.Dasent and Mr. Semper, ENL Coordinators,  meet on a monthly basis with the ELL teachers  for professional development. 
Strategies and skills for listening, speaking, reading and writing are discussed at the meetings. We discuss how to prepare 
students for the NYSESLAT and also the implications for instruction. ENL teacher participates in our Marvelous Mondays PD 
sessions designed to meet all staff needs.  PD such as differentiated instruction for ELL teachers, Common Practices, QR Rubric 
and pedagogical practices some of the topics discussed.  PD is conducted for the entire faculty on PD days and in individual and 
small group formats. The ENL Coordinator offers the parent Coordinator PD opportunities on compliance and intake and 
explanations of Part 154 as needed. The assistant principals, who regularly offer PD, always include an ESL component to all 
instructional PD.  ELL teachers have been sent to various outside PDs that covered topics such as writing the LAP and Nuts and 
Bolts of ESL administration. The PD plan also includes topics such as ELL procedures, the CCLS for ELLs, and modifications for 
ELLs. In addition, all paraprofessionals are included in our professional development cycles. To ensure proper record keeping, 
attendance in taken at each session, agendas are created and minutes are taken and referred to at subsequent meetings. All 
agendas and minutes are kept in schools Committee Binder.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
PProfession development is on- going: 
~ PD provided to staff to assist the transition of ELLs as they transition includes grade level meetings ~ Cohort of teachers 
receives training: ELL Common Planning meetings to gain knowledge of the ELL identification process, mandated services, as 
well as the components CR Part 154.2.  Teachers work in teams horizontally and vertically analyzing data, such as the School 
Quality Snap Guide, Item Skills Analysis, Writing PD's etc.District offers additional ENL Professional Development sessions 
through the year: ELL School Monitoring Workshop, Nuts and Bolts, Practical Tools to Build Academic, Monthly District 11 ELL 
Liaisons' Meeting, Language Across the Content Areas. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
A parent coordinator is used to promote parental involvement in our school and provides translation services as needed.  In 
addition, our ENL coordinator and guidance counselor are Bi-lingual. They are available to parents during the school day and at 
scheduled events.  Parent workshops are offered in English and Spanish throughout the school year.  Workshops include topics 
such as curriculum, college selection, financial aid, and parent rights in the DOE.  Parents can participate in many school events 
such as Career Day, Bring Your Dad to School, Trips, and Learning Leaders.  We campaign for a close relationship with ELL 
parents through correspondence via mail, such as a welcome letter from the ENL teacher, orientation information, Parents 
Association, Parent Surveys, and Parent Teacher Conferences as well as opportunities for ELL parents to meet with ENL 
Coordinator to discuss issues and concerns. Parent needs such as call time and meeting time are considered to accommodate 
work schedules and travel time. There is an afternoon and an evening schedule for all parent teacher conferences.  Our ENL 
teacher also meets with our ELL parents throughout the year to discuss their child's goals for the program,  language

development progress,  English language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in content 
area.  Attendance is recorded by our ENL teacher and kept on file.  When necessary, interpreters/translators will be provided 
for parents in their native language. 
 
Parents are notified and invited to speak with teachers on Tuesdays during parent outreach time. At these meetings teachers 
discuss recent assessment results and reinforce various ways parents can continue to support their child both socially and 
academically.  In house translation is available to parents by staff members who speak Spanish, French, and Hatian-Creole. For 
parents who do not speak any of the aforementioned languages teachers have access to the Translation Unit phone number 
provided by the DOE. The Principal Newsletter goes out to parents monthly and is translated in parents preferred language.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
Our ENL teacher keeps records on file for all annual and individual meetings with ELL parents as well as outreach (phone calls, 
letters, workshops) to ensure parent needs are accommodated.  We evaluate the needs of our parents via parent surveys, ENL 
“entitlement” or “non-entitlement” letters as it corresponds to the NYSESLAT score of their child each fall of every new school 
year.  Parents are invited to attend rewarding trips based on student behavior.  Parents also have access to the Skedula 
website. On this website parents can access their child’s grades, attendance and anecdotal logs written by teachers logging 
student challenges and progress.  Emails are also available on Puil Path so that parent-teacher contact is greatly facilitated to 
meet all the needs of parents of ELLs as they may arise throughout the school year.  Our parent coordinator serves as a 
facilitator and conducts outreach to engage parents in their children's education.  Events such as open school night and other 
community involvement are organized by our parent coordinator and helps create a welcoming school environment to 
parents.

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

Use language line to inform parents they can call the school in their language (use a phone script). There are trained 
staff to use the 3-way call system to add Language Line to incoming calls, for parents who prefer a language other 
than English. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Language Access Coordinator will turnkey training on language access to all staff members and/or distribution of 
Language Line information, for parents who prefer a language other than English. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

When the need arises as per Chancellor's Regulation A-663, oral interpretation is provided. Information about how to 
obtain translations and interpretations are posted in the lobby for parents in English and the eight languages as per 
the Chancellor's Regulations, the signs indicating to the parents the availability of language services and directing 
them to the location of these services. If ever in-house staff cannot provide the specific services needed, we then 
request services from the Department of Education’s Language Translation and Interpretation Unit. P.S. 78X provides 
notice of language assistance services at parent engagement events when is needed (i.e Parent’s night, PTA meetings 
etc) These findings will be distributed to school staff via a memorandum and email. All notification documents can be 
found at the Language Translation and Interpretation Unit's intranet site. Documents such as Principal Newsletter, 
EOY Parent letter and currently we are in the process to translate the parent Handbooks are translated. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

In order to gather feedback from parents on the quality and availability of services, we provide a mid and end of the 
year parent surveys during share fairs and during monthly ELL Parent session. We are looking to schedule a focus 
group of parents inclusive of all cultures and languages represented in our school to gather feedback and best 
practices on diversity and parent involvement.
