Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The P.S. 81 family appreciates that each child is a unique individual; that all children are creative; that all children can, 
and will, succeed. Therefore, P.S. 81 respects the individual needs of all children; fosters a nurturing environment 
while emphasizing the social, emotional, physical, and intellectual development of each child. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 81 Q is an elementary school nestled in the outer edge of Ridgewood, Queens. Although, we are currently 
experiencing a shift of demographics in our neighborhood, we successfully remain a constant support and backbone 
to the community. We are a historical building, built over 100 years ago, and we boast about our two building 
campus. A tour of Ridgewood would not be complete without viewing the beautiful architecture and facade of the 
school. P.S. 81 has a large enrollment of immigrant families, most of whom are of Hispanic descent. Generations of 
families from various backgrounds have contributed to the school’s rich history and culture throughout the century. 

We have approximately 694 (including PreK) and as of the 2017-2018 school year we house 4 Pre-K classes. We have 
developed an appropriate early childhood learning environment that meets the educational, social, and psychological 
needs of our Pre-K students.  

The school is comprised of 86% Hispanic, 6% White, 1.5% African American, 5% Asian and the remaining 1.5% of 
various ethnicity's. Our Student body includes 26% English as a New Language Learners and 25% Special Education 
Students. Boys account for 53% and girls account for 47%. In addition, our average attendance rate for the school year 
2017-2018 was 94.4%. 

 

In our child-centered learning environment, children can develop as critical and literate thinkers via the ReadyGen 
reading program, authentic learning experiences and inquiry- based learning. We use authentic literature, in addition 
to research-based curriculum materials, to develop literacy in all content areas and foster experiences that help 
children meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. The children’s language and experiences are valued and utilized 
to develop self-esteem, new skills and concepts. Our goal is to stimulate, encourage and support growth and learning 
through problem solving and independent thinking.  

Our classroom teachers work closely with our Teacher Center Staff Developers, Administration, Grade Leaders, and 
the Literacy Coach to share best practices and ensure that our students are not only meeting, but also exceeding NYS 
Common Core Learning Standards. We are broadening our work with performance-based learning and authentic 
assessments, as well as the Danielson Framework toward teacher effectiveness 

Collaboration with families is a priority for us, as we know that the home/school partnership is essential for the 
success of our students. Families are invited into our classrooms to engage in academic activities with their children, 
as well as engage in school wide events such as our Hats off to Reading, Fall Masquerade Parade, October “Parent-
Teas”, Winter and Spring Concerts, Fall, Winter and Spring weekend family events, Fall and Spring Open House, and 
our Thanksgiving/ Multicultural Celebrations. Throughout the year we also provide multiple parent workshops and 
activities with our Parent Coordinator, Coaches, and Principal.  

Day and evening workshops are hosted for parents on topics such as: Getting to Know the Common Core, Forming 
Study Habits and Homework Routines, and preparing for state testing. Classroom teachers invite families to celebrate 
our young writers for “Publishing Parties” and other classroom celebrations. We are proud to have well over 90% of 
our families present during our Parent-Teacher Conferences for important conversations about academic 
performance and progress. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

We have very successful enrichment and extra-curricular programs, i.e. Ballroom and Hip-Hop Dancing, Drama and 
Chorus Clubs, Enrichment “pull-out” classes, Chess Club, as well as other clinics and workshops. With the new 
addition of our Physical Education Program, all students have the chance to participate in rigorous, engaging physical 
activities as well as learn about various sports and healthy eating habits. 

P.S. 81 Q Elementary School recognizes that in order to meet the diverse needs of the students and families of this 
community, the role of the school should expand beyond traditional definitions of teaching and learning. We have an 
“open-door” policy and maintain good standing and trusted relationships between parents and the staff of P.S. 81. 
One way in which we are successful and committed to this endeavor is by making sure all information is translated 
into native languages, in order to close the communication gap.  

We are committed to the well-being of the “whole child” and support our students in various ways. We are proud of 
our new program that was launched during the 2015-2016 school year. This innovative program utilized a variety of 
multi-media and technology to explore kindness, compassion and empathy towards others. The program explores 
topics using literature and multimedia to introduce values, build community, learn how to be a friendly team 
member, telling the truth, problem solving, being kind and generous, and never giving up. We are excited to continue 
with this endeavor for the 2018-2019 school year.  

Weekly collaboration of teachers, the Literacy Coach, and administration has proven to be invaluable within our 
school. Analyzing data has become a routine practice and the basis for curriculum decisions. Significant student  

growth and achievement in Mathematics were documented through the Math Beginning of Year, Mid-Year and End of 
Year data. As a building, we have seen a 20% increase in these scores. 

Review of data and review of classroom performance, particularly reading tests and end of unit assessments, indicate 
that the 2nd grade has difficulty in meeting the state standards and often score below other grades in the school, 
therefore making this our key area of focus. Based on our assessments of students who are in the second grade, our 
second grade will need additional support, particularly in relation to the Standards in Reading and Math. 

We need to focus on students who do not make sufficient improvement by providing them with support services. We 
also need to boost all efforts in meeting the needs of our at-risk students. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our ENL and Special Education programs create data-informed scaffolds to support our English as a New Language 
Learners and students who benefit from small group instruction that are targeted to their individual needs. Our 
robust specialty program engages students with rich arts and content-area experiences in visual arts, dance, music, 
physical education, wellness, science and social studies. Students investigate and explore Mathematics and Science 
using Go Math and STEM lessons. Units of Study in Social Studies focus on project-based learning about our 
community, neighborhood, families, city, country, and world.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
P.S 81 Q strengths are our ability to provide our teachers and staff with high quality professional learning 
opportunities as well as opportunities for teachers to meet weekly and collaboratively plan during weekly common 
prep periods in order to address student’s needs. Our needs, based on the 2016-2017 School Quality Snapshot and 
our 2016-2017 school wide data are to foster rigorous instruction, promote a shared understanding of multiple access 
points, scaffold and differentiate instruction to address the diverse needs of all students. In addition, our scores on 
our end of Unit Comprehension Assessments Exams showed that only 22% of our school scored in the On-Level 
category and only 7% of the school scored in the Exceeding Category in proficiency which led us to the need to 
increase our rigorous instruction within the classroom.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all students will engage in rigorous thought provoking discussions, where a variety of learners will be able 
to cite evidence to support their thoughts there by deepening their understanding across all subject areas, in turn 
creating student autonomy, as measured by a 5% increase in ELA state performance exam and a 10% increase in End of 
Unit Comprehension Assessment Exams.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 
Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

To help promote the incorporation of more rigorous instruction 
within the classroom, professional learning during Monday 
afternoon's professional learning block will be focused on 
incorporating rigorous instruction into classrooms in the form of 
activities and tasks as well as Questioning and Discussion 
Techniques. The Literacy Coach will guide teachers on how to 
implement these strategies during common prep periods and 
inter-visitations.

Throughout the 2017-2018 school year we have analyzed data from our DRA assessment, ReadyGEN Performance 
tasks, ReadyGEN End of Unit Comprehension Exams and periodic Math Exams to identify student performance trends. 
Our conclusions were that while both our English as a New Language (ENL) students and our Students with Disabilities 
(SWD) made progress in Math from the beginning of the year to the End of the year with our ENL students increasing 
by 29% for On-Level in Math and 19% increase for Exceeding in Math and our SWD students making a 28% increase 
for On-level in Math and an 18% increase for Exceeding in Math our ENL and SWD students where not making 
adequate movement in Reading comprehension. Both our SWD and ENL students were at Risk at the end of the June 
2018 school year with 85% of our ENL students At Risk and 87% of our SWD students AT Risk on the DRA Assessment.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As reflected in ADVANCE, there has been improvement in teacher practice focusing on differentiation and P.S. 81 
received a score of a 3.49 on our School Quality Guide for Rigorous Instruction, However, according to our School 
Quality Guide P.S.81's score was below that of the district (-.37) and below that of the city (-.20) for Rigorous 
Instruction. In addition, from daily walk-throughs conducted throughout the 2017-2018 school year, we have found 
that there is a wide range of understanding in regards to academic rigor, scaffolding and differentiation. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Unfortunately, P.S. 81 has had to excess numerous teachers due to a decrease in enrollment caused by rezoning and 
changes in the neighborhood. Our current staff members are all highly qualified on the annual BEDS survey. 

In order to continue to grow as professionals, our staff will participate in differentiated, tiered, professional learning. 
The professional learning opportunities will include, but will not be limited to, academic rigor, scaffolding, classroom 
management, emotional and social development of children, and differentiation. We will also provide teachers with 
the opportunity to participate in inter-visitations with their colleagues. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our school developed a professional learning plan that addresses our core curriculum, Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS), Danielson Framework and our school wide instructional focus as well as the ongoing needs of the 
teachers. 

Our high quality professional learning includes the following: 

• Ongoing and intensive professional learning provided by the administration, lead teachers, coaches and outside 
agencies to further develop and support newly hired pedagogues. 

• Professional learning plan that addresses CCLS, Use of Data and Danielson. 

• Ongoing professional learning that addresses implementation of our core curriculum (Ready Gen and Go Math), 
Data Driven Instruction, Analyzing Student Work, Danielson Framework and Best Practices. 

• Ongoing professional learning topics are also created based on the needs of our teachers as per teacher surveys 
needs assessment.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
In an effort to assist preschool children in the transition from early childhood programs to the elementary school 
program a Pre-K to Kindergarten Transition Team consisting of the principal, early childhood assistant principal, 
Parent Coordinator and guidance counselor was formed. This Transition Team works collaboratively to assist 
preschool children in making the transition from early childhood programs to our school. Eligible students are 
provided with early intervention services to address academic and social/emotional needs. The team works closely 
with nearby schools and CBO’S to ensure seamless transitions. In May, the early childhood assistant principal, with the 
help of translators, holds a Welcoming Parent Orientation for incoming kindergarten students. Topics addressed 
during this orientation include: “Helping Your Child Make the Transition” and “A Typical Day in Kindergarten”. Parents 
and potential students are given a tour of our Kindergarten facilities and are also provided with valuable materials to 
help them assist in the transition from Pre-K to Kindergarten. The orientation is a great opportunity for students to 
see the school before the actual start date. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
A MOSL team was created, which attended professional development sessions given by Central to learn about MOSL 
and its alignment with the teacher evaluation system ADVANCE. The MOSL team conducted several meetings in order 
to review and discuss all options offered. The MOSL assessment measures decision for the school were based on the 
recommendations of the MOSL team in conjunction with the principal. In addition to MOSL, our school utilizes several 
appropriate assessment measures such as pre, mid and post unit assessments in Math, ReadyGEN End of Unit 
Comprehension Exams, DRA assessment, predictive assessments, teacher assessments and written performance task 
assessments. Based on these assessments, teacher teams track student performance trends to establish flexible 
grouping, provide scaffolds and modifications in order to promote student learning and achievement. In addition, our 
school utilizes multiple assessment measures to help assess professional development opportunities aligned with the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

Danielson Framework, Common Core Learning Standards, and our Core Curriculum in ELA and Math in order to build 
teacher capacity in the use of data to help drive instructional practice. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S. 81, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

P.S. 81 Queens will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

P.S. 81 Queens Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          37

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Since P.S 81 has a high population of English Language Learners with diverse needs our Parent 
Coordinator in conjunction with our ENL Coordinator, will offer 10 additional parent workshops 
throughout the school year, one a month every third Wednesday to help provide our parents with 
valuable information and resources that they would not be able to acquire. These workshops 
titles are based on a needs assessment survey that will be distributed to the parents at the 
beginning of the year.  Workshops are conducted either in the mornings or evenings by certified 
teachers and range from 1 hour to 2 hours depending on the workshop and need of our parents. 
Interpreters are made available at all meetings and workshops and letters are sent home to 
parents in their preferred language as well as messages sent through the Global Connect 
System.  Some of the workshops that have been requested by parents are as follows: 
"Immigration Workshop", " What should I expect when my child learns more than one 
Language?"," Educating Parents on the U.S. School System", "Parent Rights", "You can Learn 
English Too: Parent learning Opportunities", and"How to help with your child"s reading skills",

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 
Early Literacy skills for ENL students are assessed using DRA, NYSESLAT and the NYSITELL. The NYSESLAT and NYSITELL data 
patterns across proficiency levels and grades show that early childhood grades are very strong in listening and speaking skills. 
The majority of early childhood ENLs scored in the advanced level of listening and speaking, while only a minority of the same 
students scored an advanced level in reading and writing. All classroom teachers analyze their student's assessment data and 
place the lowest performing students into the Target Population for Inquiry work.  When an ENL student falls within the lowest 
third of the class' data they are placed in the extended day program. This program will provide students with small group 
instruction. Individualized lessons are also available and are catered to students who fall below the standards. 
ENL Periodic Assessments are administered in Fall and Spring. These assessments provide teachers with detailed information 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

about their students' strengths and needs in English language development and serve as a resource to help plan individual and 
group instruction. 
ENL students equally participate in the Common Core aligned instructional program which regularly ensures continuity of 
rigorous instruction with high expectations. Performance data shows that ENL students who move among different programs 
tend to perform poorly compared to those who participate in strong, coherent programs. Instructional programs with high 
levels of rigor and support result in higher academic achievement for ENLs, contrasting with a simplified curriculum for ENLs.  
The data yielded from the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) is used to focus on the progress toward achievement of proficiency. 
The most recent data indicates that of the NYSESLAT test takers, one third of the students remain on the same proficiency 
level and one third advance one proficiency level. This data is used to design effective instructional programs and interventions 
for these students.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Upon review of the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) looking specifically at modalities of need, Tier III (Intensive Intervention) of 
the RtI is implemented. Small groups of students are taught the academic writing skills they need through sustained and 
connected instruction so that it is continually linked to oral language and reading instruction. 
Strategies for promoting ENL's written language development during the instructional core include: connecting the ways in 
which students and their families use literacy at home and in the community, provide different types of writing tools in the 
classroom, promote different types of writing purposes, genres and formats, and teaching the writing process. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
At P.S. 81, we use ELL Periodic Assessments which are administered in the Fall and Spring. We use the detailed data they 
provide as part of our inquiry work, focusing on Ell's. These assessments, which measure proficiency in each of the four 
modalities; Reading, Writing Listening and Speaking, provide teachers with more relevant data that they can u se for 
instruction than ELA periodic assessments. We use The Continuum for Academic Rigor and Excellence (CARE) instrument as a 
tool to assess the coherency and academic rigor of our ENL programs based on performance indicators stemming from the 
eight LAP principles. Based on where responses are clustered on the scale for each principle, we are able to clearly identify the 
strengths and weaknesses of our ENL programs. We continuously use this tool to evaluate the LAP and how it is being 
implemented.  
We use the ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) to measure progress toward the goal of English proficiency and to identify students 
who exhibit known risk factors to tailor targeted interventions for at-risk populations before reaching a more critical level. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once summative data has been gathered, we analyze the data through a Language Acquisition lens. Certain elements of the 
second language acquisition process compare to learner characteristics associated with Learning Disabilities. Once the ELL 
learning profile has been established, using multiple indicators and sources of information, targeted supplemental 
interventions are offered to those who need more support. 
In order to make accurate decisions about sources of difficulties, information from multiple sources must be gathered and 
examined such as: information about the learner, his or her classroom experiences and his or her home and community 
context. 
Instructional plans are based on ENL students' full profiles, including their strengths and weaknesses. Assessment batteries 
must include measures of code-based skills (phonological processing and phonics skills) and meaning-based skills (listening 
comprehension, vocabulary knowledge and conceptual knowledge). Once the ELL learning profile has been established using 
multiple indicators and sources of information, the collected data is used to hone in on specific issues for intervention. A 
effective and comprehensive approach to promote ENL students' reading development includes targeted supplemental 
interventions offered to those who need more support. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 RtI screening is used in conjunction with HLIS and screening of ENLs to identify those students who are at-risk for academic 
difficulties. RtI screening assesses literacy skills and whether or not they are meeting grade level benchmarks. The extra 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

 

supports are implemented to design a more effective individualized instructional program. RtI is an instructional model that 
aims at prevention and early intervention through a tiered system of instructional support. Tier I (Core of Instruction) is 
provided to all ENL students which includes rigorous and evidence-based instruction. Tier II ("Double Dose' of Instruction) 
provides extra attention and activities and Tier III (Intensive Intervention) is provided for small group of five children.   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 The patterns across proficiencies and grades show that the students who have been here for a longer time and have scored at 
the higher levels on the NYSESLAT have also received higher scores in the content area examinations.  Children who have been 
here less than three years scored mainly on levels one and two. 
The analysis of the data shows that Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ENL students face challenges when taking state-wide 
exams, perhaps due to the difficulty and time needed to acquire a second language.  Therefore, it is important that we 
continue to immerse the children in grade level content, while providing language support.  Teachers are integrating the 
essential practices for ENL students in the school curriculum by developing oral language through meaningful conversation, 
teaching skills through contextualized instruction, building vocabulary through authentic experience with words, activating 
schema by building background knowledge and teaching meaning-making skills.  By utilizing these practices, P.S. 81 is 
confident that Entering, Emerging and Transitioning ENL students will grow to acquire the necessary skills needed to achieve 
grade level standards. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

At PS81Q we use grade-level planning meetings for examining, interpreting, and sharing data. RtI is used as a focused problem-
solving model and early intervention through tiered layers of instructional support. Intensive small-group interventions are put 
in place for ENL students who are struggling with early literacy skill development. Progress monitoring ensures that instruction 
is adjusted to meet the needs of individual students. Once a plan for a struggling reader is in place, and additional supports are 
underway, it's necessary to use assessments to monitor the effectiveness of the supports, to determine whether a child is 
making gains as expected, and to ensure any necessary corrections are taken.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

In P.S. 81 our students are grouped heterogeneously by class. Our ENL teachers utilize a push-in and pull out model to 
provide instruction to our designated ENL students within all identified K-5 classes.  Standalone ENL instruction 
develops English language skills so that students can succeed in core content courses. It is delivered by a certified ENL 
teacher. Integrated ENL is instruction to build English language skills through content area instruction. It is delivered 
through co teaching by an ENL teacher and content area teacher. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

  N./A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

  Our Kindergarten Dual Language program utilizes an ICT model where the teachers teach 50% of the class time in 
Spanish and 50% of the class time in English.  The students are heterogeneous grouped and stay together for the 
whole day.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            As per state mandates, Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning students will be serviced for 360 minutes a week with 2 
units of ENL broken down into 1 unit of standalone ENL and 1 unit of integrated ENL  and Expanding students will be serviced 
180 minutes a week through integrated ENL instruction.  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
Core literacy instruction builds on and expands students' existing oral language competencies to support literacy learning and 
content knowledge. Research shows that English oral language proficiency is closely related to academic achievement in 
English. Integrated ENL instruction builds students' oral language skills through teaching specialized vocabulary and the 
specialized structures of language in academic speech and text (academic language). 
Core instruction that promotes oral language development is rich in both language and content. In these learning 
environments, students have opportunities to learn about, study and discuss the language of texts. They use these text-based 
content learning in interactive experiences like labs, demonstrations, dramatic plays, and debates that promote academic 
conversation and knowledge building. 
 
Teachers scaffold academic language to support ENLs participation in all content areas. Teachers model the use of the 
academic language in ways in which students are expected to respond and participate. Language functions and structures are 
taught within the context of the content area lesson. Instructional materials include a wide range of print, visual and digital 
resources designed for increasing English language proficiency. Integrated ENL is instruction to build English Language skills 
through content area instruction.  
 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    To ensure that our ENLs are appropriately evaluated in their home language, students who score at a lower level on the 
Spanish LAB are further evaluated in order to identify a possible SIFE student.  Additionally, ENLs who are referred for Special 
Education are given evaluations in their home language, as well as in English by a bilingual psychologist and bilingual speech 
pathologist.  Additionally, ENL students are offered state assessments (math and science) in their Home languages, alongside 
their English booklets.  These assessments are scored by bilingual state-certified teachers at a regional scoring site.    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 In order to address the diverse needs of ENL students, it is necessary to employ differentiated instruction for SIFE, 
Newcomers, Developing, Long-term ENL students and students with special needs, and transitional ENL students.  Newcomers 
who are Entering are given an in house test so SIFE students are identified as early as possible and intervention strategies can 
be developed to assist in their foundational skills.  To meet the needs of Newcomers and SIFE students, they are targeted for 
small group interventions, and are receiving AIS services in reading and mathematics three times a week.  They are also 
allowed to use home language and home language support materials in content areas. 
 
In addition, Newcomers are invited to attend the Early Bird Literacy and Math Program to help them increase their level of 
English proficiency and succeed in core academic subjects.  The Early Bird program focuses on phonics and increasing their 
academic vocabulary. SIFE students are encouraged to attend the Extended Day Literacy and Math Program, which prepares 
them for the state and city mandated standardized exams and focuses on reading strategies such as finding the main idea, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

summarizing, using context clues and cause and effect. 
 
Teachers of long term ENL students adapt their instructions to accommodate these students. Students receive additional 
instruction based on their abilities to learn literacy skills and enhance comprehension in order to meet grade level standards. 
They work in small groups and at times on a one-to-one basis.  They also receive AIS services in both math and reading. 
 
Classroom teachers, content area teachers, math teachers and reading teachers provide support for these students in order to 
assist them in meeting grade level standards.  ENL strategic instruction is incorporated into all subject areas, so students are 
able to transition smoothly.  Teachers receive professional development in order to understand and implement basic ENL 
methodology. 
Strategies that promote ENL students' oral language development are explicitly planned and incorporated throughout the 
school day. These strategies include: building background knowledge (previewing key concepts and challenging vocabulary), 
close and interactive reading aloud (front load vocabulary), collaborative discussion and debate and intensive vocabulary 
instruction. 
 
Students with only one year in an American school are held to the same standards expected of all students regardless of 
language proficiency.  Students are provided with additional support through the use of ENL strategies and scaffolding 
techniques supplied by the ENL and classroom teachers.  Students are expected to learn content area knowledge while 
acquiring English as their second language.  Students are given extra support through the intervention of AIS reading and math 
teachers and are invited to attend Title III supplemental programs. 
 
ENL students who have been in New York City schools for six years or more are given additional support to ensure that they 
are prepared and capable of working within content areas in the upper grades of education.  Students are expected to take all 
state and city exams.  To ensure their success, many plans have been implemented to work with these students.  This includes 
extended day programs, which focus on content and language through the support of highly qualified ENL teachers.  
Former ENL students who are testing proficient receive 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL for two years after testing out 
and receive all ENL testing accommodations. Former ENL students up to two years after exiting ENL status 
Strengthening classroom instruction is a key step to supporting ENL students who are at-risk for or experiencing difficulties. 
The instructional core (or RtI model) is tailored to the needs of the classroom population. The Center for Research on 
Education, Diversity and Excellence (CREDE) provides five interrelated instructional principles for teachers of linguistically 
diverse populations: Teachers and Students Produce Together, Developing Language and Literacy Across the Curriculum, 
Making Lessons Meaningful, Teaching Complex Thinking and Teaching Through Conversation. Intensive, Targeted Intervention 
is provided to support ENL students who are not showing sufficient progress on the skills or competencies measured. 
 
 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 P.S. 81Q  has six Special Education self-contained classes in grades K-5.  Each has a maximum number of twelve students and 
is led by one special education certified teacher and one full-time paraprofessional for students.  An ENL stand alone or 
integrated model is used to provide services to the ENL students for the mandated hours.  Additionally, instruction is 
differentiated to accommodate the diverse learning needs of the special needs students. 
 
Some of our ENL students with IEPs are also placed in an Integrated Co-Teaching classrooms, in which a regular education 
teacher and special education teacher work together to provide instruction to general education and special education 
students.  The teachers work together to differentiate instruction.  Many of these special education students are ENLs. They 
are serviced by a stand alone or integrated model of instruction by the  ENL teacher for the mandated hours of service and in 
accordance with IEP recommendations.  A certified ENL teacher services nine classes in this manner. 
Teachers of ELL-SWDs develop a profile that includes information about the student's strengths and areas of need. They 
ensure that ENL students' learning opportunities are meeting ENLs' learning needs. Examples include: learning environment 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

reflects the sociocultural process of language and content learning, language experiences connect to relevant issues in Ells' 
lives. Learning experiences connect to ENLs' students' personal, cultural, language and world experiences, ENL students are 
provided with opportunities to work in pairs and small groups, ENLs are provided with opportunities to demonstrate their 
understanding in a variety of ways, including their home language. 
 
All P.S. 81Q teachers are trained in the use of differentiated and scaffolding methods to bring standard-based content to ENL 
students, including realia, TPR, vocabulary, accountable talks, guided reading, sentence structure, and extensive modelling and 
structured guide for independent work.   
 
 
 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 
The use of the workshop model in reading, writing and math helps to bridge language and content together in meaningful 
ways. The workshop model guarantees that the students are introduced to the strategies and given the chance to work 
independently and cooperatively to achieve their goals.  ENL students are explicitly taught with the help of the following 
instructional materials: grade level books, big books, technology, manipulatives, graphic organizers, web-based phonics 
programs, and audio and visual tools. 
 
English language learners identified as having special needs are provided with a multitude of support systems.  Special 
education and related services teachers, as well as ENL teachers support them.  These support systems allow for differentiated 
instruction, as well as more individualized instruction.  All teachers collaborate during their common planning period  to ensure 
the success of students in all subject matters.  ENL Special Education students  are given their mandated ENL instructional time 
through a stand-alone or integrated model of instruction.    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
 P.S. 81Q has several targeted intervention program for our ENL students.  In ELA, teachers employ a variety of interventions to 
assist our ENL students.  Small group instruction, one-on-one conferencing sessions, and scaffolding/differentiation are used to 
support the students.  In math, the teachers use differentiated instruction to address the varying needs of the students.  In 
Math the instruction is guided by the results of various Go Math assessments which assist in identifying the areas of weakness, 
as well as strength for each individual student.  In this way, teachers are able to focus on the needs of our ENL students.  In 
science, P.S. 81Q has created two science labs.  These labs provide the students with ample opportunities to conduct hands-on 
science experiments and concepts.  ENL students thrive on visual stimuli and the science lab provides the perfect opportunity 
for students to experience the concepts that they have read about.  Home language support is given through resources 
provided in their home language, such as bilingual glossaries, reference books, visual charts and online resources.  
  
Our ENL students who have scored a score of Commanding on the NYSESLAT are given extended time on all state testing in 
accordance with state mandated guidelines.  On the ELA state assessment, this includes time and a half and an additional 
reading of the listening passage.  On the math state assessment, this includes time and a half and a companion version of the 
exam in their native language.  These accommodations give transitional support for the ENL students who have reached 
proficiency on the NYSESLAT. 
  
P.S. 81Q  provides an environment in which all students feel comfortable using English to read, write, listen and speak as they 
progress through the stages of English language acquisition, which is necessary for academic success.  Peer teaching 
opportunities are used through task- based instructions and extensive use of inquiry- based learning to help support our ENL 
students.  
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

All instruction will be delivered through the Common Core Standards using teaching points.  Most lessons will aim to provide 
practice in the four modalities (reading, writing, listing, and speaking). 
  
Teachers of students in all ENL/ELA, math, science, and social studies classes will differentiate instruction.  ENLs are explicitly 
taught with the help of the following instructional materials: grade level books, big books, technology, bilingual dictionaries, 
manipulatives, graphic organizers, web-based phonics programs, audio and visual tools.  P.S. 81Q utilizes the use of technology 
where every classroom has an ENO board and each classroom has a minimum of 6 laptop computers.  The students have 
access to five different databases (KidsSearch, Searchasaurus, EBSCOHost, Funk and Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia and 
EBSCOHost in Spanish), and grade-level computer software programs such as our reading program Lexia. 
Students who achieve proficiency on the NYSESLAT will continue to be supported to ensure success in their academic 
studies.  Classroom teachers continue to incorporate ENL strategies into the curriculum and ENL teachers remain available to 
provide support for these students.  Additionally, these students are invited to attend Title III programs.  PS 81’s Title III 
programs provide English language learners with quality supplemental instruction designed to assist them in meeting academic 
rigor and proficiency in English.    An Early Bird Literacy, After School ENL Program and Math Program will target students at an 
Entering level of English proficiency in grades 1-5.  
  
The Early Bird Literacy, After School Literacy and Math Instructional Programs will service ENL students in grades 1-5.  These 
sessions will meet from November through March.   The sessions will take place on Tuesday and Thursdays for the Early Bird 
from 7:00 to 7:40am , Saturdays from 9:00am to 12:00 pm and Saturdays for the Math Program in the Spring.  Group size will 
be maintained at 12-15 students per teacher.  Highly qualified/certified ENL teachers will provide supplemental instruction in 
alignment with the New York City and New York State content and performance standards.  Instruction will focus on: 1) 
Literacy: Reading Comprehension Strategies, Opportunities for Response; Reading Logs, Conferencing and Helping Students To 
Ask Questions and using Critical Thinking Skills. 2) Math: Estimating, Problem Solving Strategies, Finding Patterns, Deciphering 
Number Sentences, and Graphing. Our focus will be on using ENL strategies to help students achieve higher scores on the 
NYSESLAT and city and state assessments.  These extra programs will help prepare students for all NYS and NYC assessments 
by reinforcing literacy skills through content area reading and writing activities.  A supplementary literacy series will be 
provided to augment English and Math instruction designed for ENL students.  Instructional supplies to be purchased will 
include chart paper, markers, composition books, sentence strips, pencils, and various other supplies. Titles to be purchased 
for this include: Step by Step Language Skills, Practice Exercises in Basic English, Phonics and Word Study, Empire State 
NYSESLAT ENL/ELL and Practice Exercises in Math. This program will have an on-site supervisor in place.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

  According to the 2017 EDAT Number of NYSESLAT Test Takers and Modalities of Strength, 12 first graders scored high in 
reading modality, yet this number dropped in grades 2-5. Number of NYSESLAT Test Takers and Modalities of Need 17 second 
graders scored low in writing modality. We will use the EDAT Advanced Warning Indicators to analyze factors including home 
language, grade level, years of ELL service, NYSESLAT proficiency and progress, attendance, age, holdover status, SIFE status 
and disability classification. We will use the EDAT to facilitate effective planning to address the needs of our ENL students. 
P.S. 81Q is utilizing the "Pull Out" and "Push In model to help directly support our ENL students.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

  P.S. 81Q has not closed a bilingual program.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 All students including our ENL population are given equal opportunity to participate in ALL programs that P.S. 81Q offers.  Title 
III programs, as well as special programs, such as chorus, Dance, chess, Homework Helper and Nutrition Club, are open to all 
students. These programs are offered throughout the school day. In addition our ENL population is offered supplemental 
services in the form of the Early Bird program that starts at 7:00am till 7:45am and our Saturday ENL program offered on 
Saturday mornings.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

Our ENL students are provided with bilingual dictionaries, leveled libraries, visual and auditory materials as well as the use of 
ENO Boards and Ipads to support them with the core content.     
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

 Home language support is delivered in numerous methods. At P.S. 81Q, all classrooms have learning and instructional 
materials in various languages spoken by students at our school. This includes bilingual dictionaries, leveled (Fountas & Pinnell) 
libraries containing books in both English and home languages. Content area instructional materials including English textbooks 
and home language textbooks for companion use to enhance comprehension. Teachers also employ the use of peer 
teaching/support via other students in the class. English-proficient/bilingual students use home language to help our ENL 
students comprehend content and stay on task. The school library has a large collection of fiction and non-fiction books in the 
home languages spoken throughout the school.  
Teachers encourage our ENL students to identify similarities and differences between their two languages and apply them to 
learning to read and write in English. Teaching for cross-language connections include identifying cognates in books read and 
creating a word wall with these examples, highlighting the similarities and differences between the home language and 
English, using students' home languages to build background knowledge and reading bilingual books. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All support and services are tailored to correspond to the age, grade level and proficiency level of our ENL students . Many 
low-level, high interest materials are available for the older students, which gives them the academic and social support 
needed for their age. Younger students have leveled libraries in their classrooms, which usually have up to four grade levels 
represented in the reading levels. All students are provided with age and grade appropriate materials.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our ENL students in both the main building and our Annex are equally provided with bilingual dictionaries, leveled libraries, 
visual and auditory materials as well as the use of ENO Boards and Ipads to support them with the core content.   Our certified 
ENL teachers service all mandated students in both buildings for the required amount of time.  
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 The Early Bird Program will service students in grades one through five.  The program is geared for students who have just 
arrived in the country and are at an Entering level of English proficiency.  The program will meet two times a week on Tuesday, 
and Thursday from 7:00 am until 7:40am for forty sessions.  It will be staffed by a highly qualified/certified ENL teacher and the 
class size will be maintained at 12 to 15 students.  The instruction will focus on increasing the English proficiency with a focus 
on speaking and listening. Instruction will be supplemented with materials such as phonics books , charts, audio and visual 
materials  and materials geared toward language proficiency. This program will be equipped with an on-site supervisor.   
  
In June, our Kindergarten teachers with the help of translators, hold a Welcoming Parent Orientation for incoming 
kindergarten students including our incoming ENL population.  Topics addressed include: Helping Your Child Make the 
Transition and A Typical Day in Kindergarten.  The orientation is a great opportunity for students to see the school before the 
actual start date. A kindergarten teacher presents the material to be taught in kindergarten and our parent coordinator is 
present to assist ALL parents with questions and programs to help support them and their children.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 P.S. 81Q does not offer electives. Students stay with their classroom teacher for the majority of the day and have one content 
specialist (i.e. science, social studies, technology, art) visit the class each day.  All classes receive library and physical 
education.        
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

 

In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

 At PS81Q we have a kindergarten Two-Way Dual Language Program which includes both native English 
speakers and ELLs. The teachers provide instruction in both English and Spanish. The students receive half 
of their instruction in their home/primary language and the remainder of the instruction in the target 
language. 
 Language is taught through the content areas as well as through literacy. For emergent literacy, extra 
time is dedicated to the rules and concepts of each language. Students receive dedicated reading time in 
each language. While the ELLs receive discreet English as a New Language the English proficient students 
must also receive target instruction to develop all four modalities, reading, writing, speaking and 
listening. The primary language acquisition goal of dual language is the development of grade-level 
appropriate bilingual and biliterate academic skills in both English and Spanish. 
 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 Professional Development workshops will focus on improving teachers’ and support staff (including paraprofessionals, 
guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologists, occupational/physical therapists, speech therapists, 
secretaries,and parent coordinators) instructional skills to better prepare our ENL student and all students in meeting and 
exceeding the NYC and NYS performance and learning standards. The workshops will take place during the Chancellor's 
conference days and during monthly Monday afternoon professional time. Our teachers receive training on servicing ELLs. 15% 
total hours ELL specific PD for all teachers and 50% total hours ELL specific PD for ENL teachers.  All meetings have an agenda 
and a staff check off on an organization sheet which is maintained by the principal. The meeting will be facilitated by our ENL 
Coordinator.  Some of the workshop topics include the following: 
                                                             *Supporting ELLs in academic vocabulary 
                                                             *Scaffolding across the Disciplines 
                                                             *Native Language Support 
                                                             *Oral Language Development 
                                                             *Mathematical Instructional Strategies to develop 
                                                               and enhance students’ skills and performance on                 
                                                               the city and state assessments 
                                                             *Classroom Environment: Placing high value on students' cultural and linguistic diversity 
                                                             *Family and Community Involvement  
Professional Development will also include language instruction aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards. Lesson 
planning will focus on high levels of rigor, differentiation and support. There will be support in designing lessons to meet 
standards while differentiating to meet students needs.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
In June,  Ms. R. Diamond, Principal, arranges an inter visitation to the neighboring middle school for all our teachers and 5th 
Grade students, and parents.  Guidance counselors are available to assist all 5th Grade ENL students during this transitional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

 

period. Parents and students are offered a tour of the middle school and are encouraged to ask questions about programs that 
are offered. 
  
The 6th grade teachers from the local middle school on a later date  visit PS81Q and meet with our 5th grade teachers, related 
service providers and guidance counselors to gather information on our ENL students as well as  all other students' academic 
backgrounds and special needs. In addition during this meeting they transfer records, conference notes, reading levels and 
writing samples to the middle school, so the future school can better assist all students, including our ENL population.          
To meet the professional development requirements, professional development for ENL teachers is provided during the 
Monday afternoon professional development time as well as during Election Day and Chancellor's conference day.  All 
meetings and professional development days have an agenda and a staff check off list via an organizational sheet that is 
maintained by the principal. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 P.S. 81 Q utilizes the Tuesday parent outreach time for parents to come in and discuss their child's progress. In addition, 
parents can schedule a meeting with the ENL coordinator, parent coordinator or administrator to discuss any aspect of our ENL 
program. All meetings are provided an interpreter when requested.  Our ENL coordinator also conducts various parent 
tutorials on specific subjects requested by parents of ENLs.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

 At P.S. 81, the ENL Department and Parent Coordinator offer approximately thirty Parent Workshops throughout the school 
year.  The workshops are designed around the needs of the parents, which are obtained via informal conversation between 
teachers, parent coordinators and parents, as well as a short survey questionnaire given to parents.  Interpreters are available 
at all meetings and letters are sent home in different languages.  Some of the workshop topics include: ADHD/ADD, English 
Language Arts for Fourth Graders, Oral Language Skills, Math Workshop, Ways of Helping Children with Homework, and The 
Role of the Family in Academic and Social Success.  
  
P.S. 81Q, through  the Department of Education,  offers ENL classes for parents three nights per week from 6 p.m to 9 
p.m.  Many of our parents use this opportunity to learn English.   
  
In addition, parents attend monthly PTA meetings, which are held during the school day and evenings.  The meetings serve as 
a way to conduct workshops and deliver all pertinent information regarding school routines and events (handbooks, 
newsletters). Parents are also allowed to voice their concerns and ask about issues that they would like to be addressed. Our 
translators attend all meetings.   
  
Parents and local residents volunteer as Learning Leaders in our school assisting selected students in reading on a regular 
schedule.  The parents who are involved as Learning Leaders take pride in performing this service at our school.  Many of the 
volunteers have been here from the time their child is admitted to our school to the time they leave for middle school.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Romy Diamond, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 81 Q recognizes the importance of communicating with parents. The majority of our parents speak Spanish 
with a small percentage speaking Arabic and Chinese, two of the covered languages. In order to maintain effective 
communication with parents we provide written translations of memos and other documents for parents. Our 
Parent Coordinator and Family Worker worked collaboratively to assess our school's written translation and oral 
interpretation needs by examining the Home Language Surveys filled out by parents, analyzing ATS data, and 
interviewing parents. In addition, our staff uses Student Emergency Contact Cards as well as a parent surveys that 
are given out twice a year to help provides us with information on how our parents prefer to communicate. We 
will provide each parent who requires language assistance services with written notification of their rights 
regarding translation and interpretation services with instructions on how to obtain such services. A sign written 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

in the covered languages will be posted in a conspicuous location near the entrance of the school indicating the 
room where a copy of the written notification can be obtained.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

both written and oral 
communication. The 
preferred languages for 
both written and oral 
communication are as 
follows:
