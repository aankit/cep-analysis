Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

Our school's mission is, "In partnership with the community and parents, MS 181 is dedicated to empowering our 
students with the social and academic skills needed to succeed in a culturally diverse society." Additionally, the vision 
of our school is, "MS 181 will create a fun, supportive, nurturing environment where a focus on Intellectual 
Engagement drives student centered learning that is articulated and supported by all stakeholders through Clear 
Expectations. Students will partake in activities that are both cognitively engaging and cultivate rich student

discussion; illustrated by classrooms in which students are responding to and extending each others thinking and 
crafting questions to help each other deepen and elaborate their thoughts. As a result, all students will be high school 
ready and college prepared."  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Pablo Casals Middle School 181 serves approximately 900 students in grades 6 through 8. Our student population is 
48% female and 52% male. Our student body is comprised of 62% black students, 29% Hispanic students, 4% Asian 
students and 4% white students. Approximately 2% of our student body is comprised of English Language Learners 
and Students With Disabilities make up approximately 27% of the population at Pablo Casals M.S. 181. We pride 
ourselves on working to the meet the needs of all students, ranging from those enrolled in our gifted program to 
those students with disabilities.  

 

While academic excellence remains at the core of who we are and what we do, we firmly believe in developing the 
whole child. Pablo Casals Middle School 181 is a school that is dedicated to making character count. We believe that 
in order to be successful, students must develop the social emotional skills necessary to compete in today’s world. 
Through consistent student celebrations in which students are recognized for academics but also with an emphasis on 
effort, charitable work and kindness, our school culture empowers students to bring out their best.  

 

We have also chosen partnerships within the community that provide our students with opportunities to grow 
academically, as well as focusing on social and emotional needs. Broadway Junior affords our students the 
opportunity to use their love for music and acting and participate in a Broadway like musical. The program builds 
students' self assurance and provides them with problem solving skills necessary for college and career. By partnering 
with Truman High School's Culinary Program, our students have an opportunity to work under a professional chef in 
planning, cooking and serving a menu filled with culinary masterpieces for family and friends. Additionally, our 
partnership with Urban Advantage increases student understanding of scientific inquiry through collaboration with 
science cultural institutions such as zoos and museums. Additionally, MS 181 has partnered with Middle School 
Quality Initiative, focusing on increasing the amount of students reading at or above grade level. Lastly, we have 
partnered with Education Through Music (ETM) to increase our student's appreciation for various genres of music 
through technology. We have created a music/technology lab in which each student works with a Mac desktop in 
their music class.  

 

The school administrators have created a school-wide professional learning plan that includes opportunities for staff 
members to receive needs based learning, as well as determined time to examine student work and create next steps 
based upon their findings. The administrative team have differentiated between Professional Learning Opportunities, 
Professional Development and Inquiry opportunities. Professional Learning at MS 181 is centered on a 5-week cycle 
that aligns to Teacher Team meeting goals. The 5-week cycle includes 3 sessions of learning and sharing on a focused 
topic area, one session for sharing of best practices and lastly one session to focus on analysis of student work and 
next steps as it pertains to the focus area. By conducting frequent observations, the team identifies areas of 
additional support needed for pedagogues and then creates Professional Development opportunities on areas such as 
behavior management and lesson planning to provide teachers with strategies and assistance when necessary. Lastly, 
based upon data from Advance, teacher and student interviews and by analyzing student work, the need for a whole 
school cross-curricular inquiry may be warranted.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

 

Over the past few years, the instructional focus has been concentrated on expanding and varying our repertoire of 
instructional practice strategies and learning activities used by teachers in all content areas. Teachers teams have 
worked on creating rigorous and engaging tasks while also identifying new and varied ways of teaching each learning 
target in order to meet the needs of all learners. This work has resulted in the development of grade level curriculum 
websites that offer teachers a menu of tools and activities in both ELA and Math. Throughout the 2018-2019 school 
year, we will focus on looking at student work and determining instructional next steps based upon analysis within 
teams and PODS. This collaborative work is a three step process in which teachers align student work products to 
each learning target and work within teams to assess student learning and growth.  

 

Furthermore, throughout the 2018-2019 school year, we will continue to emphasize the use of technology within 
each classroom. All classrooms are currently equipped with class sets of devices (lap tops, I pads, etc.) and 
Promethean Interactive Flat Panel TV's which have modernized the flow of lessons in every classroom and are 
providing our students with opportunities to research and collaborate in 21st Century classrooms. Additionally, we 
have partnered with IO Learning which will now enable teachers to use an online grade book, Pupil Path, to keep 
parents informed of student progress.  

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Approximately 3% of our student body is comprised of English Language Learners and Students With Disabilities make 
up 27% of the population at Pablo Casals M.S. 181. Our students' needs range from emotional, learning disabled as 
well as English Language Learners. We currently have two self contained and ICT classes on each grade level. Our 
school is 100% departmentalized. All special education and ICT teacher teams are considered "masters" of their 
content and teach only one subject.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

As per the Framework for Great Schools, one of the strengths that exist within Pablo Casals Middle School 181 lies in 
the rigor of our instruction and the collaboration of our teachers. Through the guidance of each department’s leader, 
pedagogues have worked collaboratively to create effective curriculum that begins with grade level curriculum maps, 
extends to differentiated unit plans across grade levels and then translates to lesson plans. Furthermore, teachers are 
able to take written plans and deliver the profound instruction that occurs in each and every classroom. We have 
created A.C.T.I.V.E. lesson planning criteria that guides our teachers in the creation of rigorous lessons with various 
strategies employed to support the learning of every child. Throughout the 2018-2019 school year, we are dedicated 
to continuing this work by developing purposeful rigorous questions that promote discussion in each lesson.  

 

In addition, Middle School 181 will continue focus on continuing to establish Strong Family and Community Ties by 
increasing the amount of parental support that occurs within our school. Through the use and expansion of "Clear

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths:  

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, Middle School 181 scored the highest in the element Rigorous 
Instruction. We increased our framework element score from a 4.61 in 2016-2017 to a 4.78. Additionally, the survey 
element score also increased from a 3.45 to a 4.13. The Common Core shifts within ELA and Math are the strongest 
components of this element. As per an analysis of 2017 NYS ELA exam, more students scored proficient with 42.6% of 
students scoring a level 3 or 4, which is a 3.1 point increase from the previous year. 40.8% of grade 6 students scored 
proficient on the 2017 NYS Math exam compared to 27.3 of students within District 11.  

 

Needs Improvement: 

While Rigorous Instruction stands as our strongest element within the Framework for Great Schools, currently only 
those students enrolled in honors classes are taking the Math Algebra 1 Regents exam and therefore receiving 
advanced curriculum requirements. As per an analysis of the 2017 NYS Math exam, only 4% of grade 8 students that 
did not take the Algebra 1 Regents exam scored proficient (level 3 or 4).  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be a 10% increase on the amount of grade 8 students invited to participate in taking the New 
York State Algebra 1 Regents exam.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths: 

Pablo Casals MS 181 strives to celebrate each child through various events throughout the year in order to encourage 
and recognize appropriate behavior. The principal and the other school leaders firmly believe that exceptional 
behavior should be recognized and additional measures should be put into place that support those students with 
behavioral issues. We are vested in supplying students in need with tools and resources rather than only punitive 
measures. Thus, Middle School 181 has implemented programs such as “Caught Doing Good” and “Excellence 
Challenges” and holds a winter and spring carnival recognizing attendance and conduct. According to the 2017-2018, 
we have increased the survey element score for Supportive Environment from a 2.45 in 2017 to a 3.64 in 2018.  

Needs: 

Although, we have made gains in the element of Supportive Environment, developing a supportive environment at 
Middle School 181 continues to be a priority within the school. As per the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, we 
received 60% positive responses on the Classroom Behavior section of the survey. Additionally, as per the 2017-2018 
Incident Location Summary report, 32% of incidents occurred within the classroom. Furthermore, as per the OORS 
Suspension Report by Race, Gender and IEP, black male students account for over 50% of the suspensions that 
occurred throughout the 2017-2018 school year and black students account for 64% of suspensions.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 15% decrease in the amount of infractions occurring throughout the school.

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will continue to use a section sheet aligned with 
specific indicators in which teachers will rate classes each period 
of the day on a 0-6 scale . Classes can only receive a score of 5 or 
6 (highest levels) by their teacher if all students are on time - 
thus decreasing the amount of students in the hallway. Teachers 
will rate classes each period of the day. Section sheets will be 
collected by deans at the end of the day.  

We will continue to use the PBIS Gumball Token System in which 
all teachers and staff will receive tokens on a monthly basis to 
give to deserving students. At the end of each month, students 
will use their tokens to receive a prize. Prizes will include parties, 
invites to special events and apparel.  

A transition post will go into effect with each hallway supervised 
by multiple people during transitions from class to class. 
Administrators will conduct a walk through of each teacher on a 
bi-weekly basis using a Google Tracker assessing the use and 
consistency of the specific management plan.  

An additional guidance counselor has been hired and will focus 
on restorative practices within groups addressing the social 
emotional needs of all students with a special focus on students 
with disabilities and ELL’s. Every third Monday's professional 
learning time will focus on training teachers in the areas of 
restorative practices and social emotional growth.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
A survey will be administered to parents in the Fall gauging interest in workshops. School leaders will create an 
awareness and consistently update parents regarding student contests and celebrations through the use of the 
welcome to 181 website, a monthly calendar and our school App. Additional parent engagement activities will be 
included throughout the year overseen by deans and assistant principal.

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Strengths: 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, we increased our score from 4.19 to 4.31 on the element 
Collaborative Teachers. The department leaders have created Teacher Team "PODS" in which teachers with the 
similar student populations have scheduled time to collaborate regarding lesson planning. Throughout the 2017-2018 
school year, teacher PODS have collectively refined math and ELA curriculum websites that went into effect in 
September 2017 with a focus on including differentiated resources, activities and lessons aligned to each learning 
target. In addition, as per the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, compared to the district and the city, one of our 
greatest strengths exists in the area of school commitment with 91% positive responses.  

Needs: 

An analysis of our online grading book, Pupil Path, revealed inconsistencies within the amount and types of student 
work products that make up each student's grade within each department. Additionally, an analysis of final 2017-
2018 Advance reports reveal that Engaging Students in Learning and Assessment In Instruction are the areas of 
greatest concern as we move into the 2018-2019 school year.  

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, teacher teams will partake in an ongoing cycles refining student tasks and looking at student work which 
will result in an overall school-wide increase of student achievement evidenced by an increase of 5% on report card 
grades within each content area.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: As per 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, Middle School 181 has rated higher than the city and district in 
each area within the element Supportive Environment. We averaged 10 points higher than the district and city in the 
area of program coherence and averaged 8% higher than the city in the area of instructional leadership. This is a 
direct correlation to each department being overseen by one administrator with strong content knowledge.  

Needs: As per the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the area of Effective School Leadership decreased from a 4.15 to a 
4.02. As MS 181 is departmentalized, school leaders are traditionally visiting their own department's classrooms. 
However, we have identified the cohesion across departments is a necessary component of effective school 
leadership. Thus, school leaders have created a tracking tool and developed classroom visitation criteria that will be 
the same for all departments. School leaders will consistently visit classrooms within and outside of their own 
departments in order to identify trends and react to and support the needs of teachers in a more timely fashion. We 
will emphasize component areas 3c and 3d within each visit.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, documented classroom visits will increase by 20%, going from 400 in the year 2017-2018 to 480 in the 
2018-2019 school year resulting in overall MOTP ratings of Effective and Highly Effective for 90% of our teachers in the 
component areas of 3c, and 3d.

Strategies to address the needs of 
students with disabilities, English 
language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., 
overage/under-credited, SIFE, 
STH). 

School leaders will use the a newly created 
Teacher Tracker Tool during learning walks 
to assess and document student 
engagement, teacher practice and learning 
environment.  

School leaders will use a calendar to ensure 
that each teacher has been visited on a 
weekly basis. School leaders will analyze 
Snapshot Tool ratings as well as MOTP 
ratings to identify needs of teachers.  

School leaders will meet in a weekly 
Tuesday cabinet meeting in order to 
identify overall school and/or department 
needs and plan professional learning as well 
as develop additional support from school 
leaders.  

A weekly inter-visitation schedule for the 
Peer Collaborative and Model Teacher's 
laboratory classroom will be posted weekly. 
Teachers identified as in need of support 
will be scheduled for a series of inter-
visitations and conferences aligned to their 
need.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths: 

The school strives to create “clear expectations” for students, parents and guardians. Thus, we have purchased an 
online homework/gradebook site called IO Learning/Pupil Path. The site enables parents to track student progress 
and react in a timely manner, view upcoming tasks and exams for each class on one screen, and directly correspond 
with their child's teachers. Additionally, the school uses My School Info app to provide parents with timely 
information regarding events, special notifications and parent nights. MS 181 also uses a Robo call system to inform 
parents if their child is late or absent and to provide important information. The school has also developed an 
informational site, Welcome to 181, which keeps parents aware of upcoming events in each department, as well as 
transitioning to high school or entering middle school as a sixth grader. Finally, a calendar of events for each month is 
backpacked home and posted onto the Welcome to 181 website. As per the School Quality Guide, MS 181 increased 
from a score of 2.85 in 2017 to a score of 3.54.  

Need: 

As noted on the 2018 Framework for Great Schools Report, Middle School 181 scored even with the city average and 
only one point higher than the district in the category, "Parent Involvement in School", Despite increasing and varying 
the amount of Parent's Association events and school communication, Pablo Casals MS 181 continues to address the 
level of parental involvement within the school.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
A vast amount of interviews are set up through the use of the NYC DOE’s New Teacher Finder, partnering with local 
colleges and universities and through Teaching Fellows with the goal of hiring only certified and highly qualified 
pedagogues. A New Teacher Hiring Fair was held at Middle School 181 in March 2018. In addition, new teacher 
workshops begin in the summer are offered on a monthly basis and designed to meet the needs of new teachers at 
M.S. 181. New teachers (to the profession and/or to the school) are matched with a teacher buddy throughout the 
year and provided ongoing mentoring. Math and Literacy Coaches designate weekly planning times with all new 
teachers throughout the school year.  

 

New teacher support begins in August and continues throughout the school year. All new teachers receive strategies 
based PD's on topics such as behavior management and establishing an environment of respect and rapport. 
Department and curriculum aligned PD's are offered monthly by each department leader. In addition, new teachers as 
well as teachers with identified needs are further supported by the Literacy and Math Coaches through a visitation 
and feedback cycles each week.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  

  All pedagogues participate in a 5-week cycle of professional learning that is designed around the school’s 

2017-2018 Instructional Focus.  

  The school wide focus this year is to develop well designed lessons aligned to each departments curriculum 

website using an established set of criteria. Professional learning opportunities are aligned to the school wide 
focus and are developed by the department leaders to encompass research based topics and best practices 
within three out of the five weeks of each cycle.  

  During the first three weeks of each cycle, department leaders present new information and provide all 
pedagogues with opportunities for discussion and collaboration. The fourth week of the 5-week cycle is 
designed around providing teachers with needs based professional learning. All pedagogues choose a session 
to attend or areassigned a session based on an identified area of need. The needs based professional learning 
opportunities are developed and planned by the Principal, Assistant Principals and/or by teachers. The fifth

week of the 5-week cycle is dedicated to looking at student work in order to identify grade level, class and 
individual student needs and to norm scoring within each department.  

  Time for teachers to collaborate on analyzing student work/data affords teachers the opportunity to reflect 

on current practices and is a critical component to supporting student achievement.  

  Paraprofessionals will attend individualized Professional Learning Offerings as well as join ELA and math PLO 

cycles.  

  Principal and assistant principals will receive professional development through partnerships such as, MSQI, 

Educators Need Love, Too, Just Say Hi and offerings by BFSC.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Middle School 181 is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and families. The school's policy is designed to 
keep families informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their 
children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent-Teacher Association, 
and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

M.S. 181 will support parents and families through the following:  

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

- Foster a home-school partnership by disseminating a "Clear Expectations" class syllabus for each content area per 
unit.  

- Provide parents with consistent updates regarding school wide events and important information through a monthly 
calendar, School Info App, and website that is updated monthly by each school leader.  

- Provide resources, tutorials and support to help parents work with their children at home through the use of a 
homework site maintained by each teacher.  

- Provide training for families on the use of technology that will enable them to communicate with staff and/or 
support their child's academic progress.  

- Provide opportunities for workshops and activities based upon identified need or want (financial aid, mental health, 
physical health, field trips for families, etc.)  

- Provide assistance to parents in understanding standards and assessments through multiple parent night events 
hosted each year.

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

1. 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members 
of the school’s Parent-Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were 
consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional 
input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will:  

 

actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of 
the school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact;  

  engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 

directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

  ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and 

 

strategies as described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact;

  provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 

accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality 
Review Report, NYC School Survey Report;  

  host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1st of each school year to advise 

parents of children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right 
to be involved in the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 
and other applicable sections under the ESSA;  
schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the 
morning or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the 
Chancellor and allow parents to provide suggestions;  
translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
At MS 181 we evaluate the student's literacy skills through running records and various teacher created materials. For the ELLs 
that have taken the ELA exam we evaluate the exam results to determine student levels as well. We use the data from the 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to also help determine the students' strengths and weaknesses. For those Spanish speaking students, 
we analyze the results from the Spanish LAB, as well.  We have learned from reviewing our data that the majority of our ELL 
students have a strength in listening/ speaking skills and a weakness in reading/ writing skills. Focus is placed on reading and 
writing skills within all classrooms to concentrate on improving those skills.  Next year we will begin using DRP (degrees of 
reading power) to get a better understanding of the students' strengths and weaknesses. The use of quarterly exams , unit 
tests, and teacher created exams further guide our understanding of how our ELL's learn and allow us to determine their 
strengths and weaknesses. This data shows us that those students need to work on of literacy foundation skills, while still 
receiving extra assistance with their current class work aligned to the common core.     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ENL teacher uses the pull-out time with the students to build foundational skills the students may be lacking, especially 
with the ELL's that are in the early stages of learning the English language. The ENL teacher and the students' classroom 
teachers frequently meet to discuss any assessments and what the student seemed to have a weakness with, and also what 
noticings we have from day by day lessons and what the child strugggled with. When the ENL teacher pushes into the 
classroom and co-teaches she gets a better understanding of how the student is doing in relation to classwork. In addition to 
working with them on their assignments while in the classroom pushing in, the ENL teacher also makes note of what needs to 
be reinforced and creates additional activities based on that during pull-out time. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 When evaluating the success of the ENL program at MS 181, the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL, and ELA exam scores are analyzed for 
student growth by level and skill. Traditionally, the students do better in listening/speaking and show a weakness in 
reading/writing. Therefore, the ENL teacher knows that the returning ELL students will require further instruction to improve 
the area of reading/writing and prepares material to support those skills by levels attained (entering, emerging, transitioning, 
expanding, and commanding). The program is also evaluated on the individual success of the students in their literacy, math, 
and core subject areas. The individual report card grades and evaluation by the subject area teachers of ELL students are also 
used as an indication for the program's success. At MS 181 we conduct fall and winter periodic assessments. The use of unit 
exams and projects allow the teachers to evaluate the knowledge the students have gained from the unit and wheat they are 
still struggling with. Traditionally, the ELL population at 181 has met the promotional criteria at all grade levels.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Teachers meet during the Monday and Tuesday extended day in grade level, content area, and pod meetings to discuss the 
growth of the students and next steps. Types of supports are in place to support the needs of the students after discussion and 
analyzing of the data. We offer morning tutoring, modify tasks, discuss grouping, as well as determine what type of technology 
should be used with the students and what types of home components would help them. In the 2017-2018 school year we will 
be hiring a literacy intervention teacher to further assist the ELL's and non ELL's alike that are struggling.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 MS 181 is not a K-5 school. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
At MS 181 we run the reports that show not only overall scores on the NYSESLAT/ NYISTELL but also shows a breakdown based 
on the sub categories.  We have found that our ELL population consistently do better on the listening/ speaking section of the 
NYSITELL and NYSESLAT across proficiency levels and grades.     
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ENL teacher meets with an assistant principal to discuss the leveling and strengths and weaknesses of the students. This 
will assist with programming, when appropriate, by allowing students with the same deficiencies to be grouped together when 
available. The findings also plays a large part in what materials are ordered and used in ENL to assist the student.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

At MS 181, the organizational models we use for ENL instruction is both the pull-out and push-in models (stand alone 
and integrated ENL.) MS 181 makes every effort to program the correct number of minutes required as per the CR 
part 154.2 for ELL students based on proficiency level . All effort is made to have the teacher push in/integrated as 
much as possible, when not feasible the teacher will pull-out/use a stand alone model, to customize the lesson for the 
ELL student in a pull-out class to meet the mandated minutes. The students that are serviced via a push-in/integrated 
method, traditionally are homogeneously grouped in the same grade/ class. The students that are serviced via pull-
out/stand alone model can be homogeneously or  heterogeneously grouped. When heterogeneously grouped, 
sometimes the students may be working on different assignments. The ENL teacher works collaboratively with the 
classroom teachers to support the ELL students. Classroom teachers conference regularly with the ENL teacher to 
learn ENL strategies to assist the ELL student in their classrooms. The ENL teacher supports the ELL students with 
scaffolding and use of manipulatives, expressive language, and total body response when delivering vocabulary, 
instruction, and/or constant verbal communication to ensure full understanding and grasp of the lesson. Instruction in 
all content areas is often composed of a mini-lesson (link and modeling), active engagement, independent work, 
differentiated small groups, and a share. Students are encouraged to incorporate turn and talk, cooperative learning, 
and partner work throughout the day.  The ENL teacher at our school is dual certified in TESOL and childhood 
education.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

MS 181 currently does not a TBE program.     

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

MS 181 currently does not have a DL program.   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The only language of instruction at MS 181 is English. Our program model of ENL receives the following services: entering, and 
emerging students receive a minimum of 360 minutes of instruction per week. The transitioning, and expanding students 
receive 180 minutes of instruction per week. The students that are at the commanding level receive 90 minutes of services per 
week to ensure that their academic progress is on track. All students at MS 181 receive a minimum of 8 periods of ELA in 6th 
and 8th grade regular education classrooms , 12 periods of ELA in 7th grade classrooms, and 10 periods of ELA in special 
education classrooms.      
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All instruction in MS 181 is delivered in English. The students attend content area classes and the ENL teacher reviews what 
was taught in class by going over the material and especially addressing vocabulary needs. The ENL teacher paraphrases the 
text books for better understanding. Both English and content areas are addressed using ENL methodologies. Instruction is 
geared toward meeting the common core learning standards by taking an additive approach and building on prior knowledge 
and assessing what the students' strengths and weaknesses are. There is articulation with the content area teachers to ensure 
continuity. All four ENL modalities are fused into all lessons (listening, speaking, reading, and writing.) At MS 181 reading and 
writings skills are being addressed through the implementation of the components of a comprehensive literacy approach. The 
ENL teacher is dually certified in both TESOL and childhood education so is able to deliver content area instruction for our 
6th  graders.    

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students may take the NYS math and science exam in their native language if the translated version is available. Students also 
use bilingual glossaries when taking any exam and well as used in class. A dictionary with direct translations of the words (no 
definitions) are also used when appropriate. The quarterly exams are translated for the students that need translation by a 
bilingual paraprofessional who sits with them during the exam. Spanish LAB is initially given to students that speak Spanish 
after the NYSITELL is given.   
 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

  a.  Sife students will be evaluated initially by the NYSITELL scores, interview, student work samples, and/ or the use of LENS 
and a plan is then devised from there to assist them. Basic reading and math skills are a focus for them. If the child has no 
school experience, a beginning reading program is the starting point focusing on sight words, picture/ word correlation, and 
phonics skills. In math basic addition and subtraction skills with the use of math manipulatives are used. If the student has 
some schooling history, reading and writing skills would be addressed such as main idea, sequencing, punctuation and 
grammar. A teacher and peer buddy may be assigned to tutor and mentor that child. Computer programs, such as Rosetta 
stone, Tumblebooks, and brain pop is used to assist the student via technology. We draw on students' backgrounds, their 
experiences, cultures, and languages to create a text to self connection.b.     The ENL program starts the students reading and 
writing from the first class. Basic vocabulary is studied with the use of visual and auditory assistance. Short stories are used as 
a learning tool consisting of a few sentences are written.  As a student progresses, longer stories and writing assignments with 
increasing difficulty is added to the lessons as necessary for testing such as main idea, inferences, etc. are introduced. All our 
students are encouraged to sign up and attend after school programs for enrichment, our ELL students are part of this. We 
strive to create confident students who value school and value themselves as learners. We organize the classroom to ensure 
that conversation between peers develop academic concepts and language.c.      ELL students in the program more than three 
years will be immersed in content area subjects. Content area vocabulary will be developed. Reading and writing will 
encompass literature in the different subject areas and skills needed to understand those stories such as the use of chunking. 
The major emphasis moved from listening/ speaking skills and to reading/ writing development. In math the reading of word 
problem and development of problem solving skills are formed. Vocabulary is repeated naturally as it appears in different 
content area studies.d.     ELL students in the program six years or longer will continue with content area instruction stressing 
reading and writing skills. Tutorials will be used to review the skills taught. Test taking skills will be emphasized. The ENL 
teacher works closely with the classroom teachers to incorporate topics learned in class. Language support is provided for 
these students in the ENL classroom. We organize collaborative activities and scaffold instruction to build students academic 
English proficiency. Again, vocabulary is repeated naturally as it appears in different content area studies.e.     All former ESL 
students continue to get test modifications for two years following a score of commanding on the NYSESLAT. The ENL teacher 
will provide 90 minutes of services for the next two years in order to ensure they continue to stay on track. The ENL teacher is 
available on her professional periods to assist teachers and former ESL students when needed. The ENL teacher continues to 
work with the classroom teacher to turn key any and all information that may help with instructing the student in a way that 
makes meaning for them.    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
For ELL students with disabilities, differentiated activities are provided based on the baseline assessment, Spring NYSESLAT 
scores,periodic assessments and needs outlined in the student IEP. After reviewing test scores and IEP mandates students are 
placed in the class setting with supports outlined in their IEP's. Students are also part of the ENL pull-out/ push-in program, 
receiving services in accordance with their NYSESLAT/ NYSITELL test results and their IEPs. This approach is the most 
individualized.

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
When ever possible the ENL periods are scheduled during the students' elective/ arts periods in order to cause a minimum 
disruption to the students' academic schedule. The curriculum is adapted to the needs of the individual student. The classes 
have one or more paraprofessionals in attendance who works closely with students who are having difficulty. The school has 
elevators to transport the students from floor to floor so they can make use of all the building's facilities such as the cafeteria, 
library, and yard.      
 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All students, including ENL students who, based on their NYS Math and ELA exam scores, whom are identified as in need of 
assistance, are encouraged to attend any  after school, morning tutoring or  Saturday Academy support services when they are 
available. In addition, these students are encouraged to attend the DEFOY program, that will provide homework assistance to 
the students as well as support for all core subjects (Math, ELA, Science, and Social Studies). After school instructional 
programs are staffed by certified content area teachers. The students use the achieve 3000 and Myon program. Special after 
school and weekend programs also address the needs of our students in relation to taking the state tests. Incentive programs 
are offered by the classroom teachers and administration as a reward to encourage students to complete their homework and 
class work, as well as encourage reading. Differentiation is used in all lessons to better target the individual students' needs. 
The intervention provided to students help foster both academic and language needs.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

MS 181 recently added the "Word by Word" language program that contains a Spanish/English picture dictionary that goes 
along with workbooks in: literacy, beginning vocabulary and life-skills, in order to better increase language acquisition skills. 
This program has shown success and will be continues to be used for the following school year. Additional programs are being 
considered as well but no determination has been made as of yet.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

MS 181 has not had a bi-lingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELL's are encouraged to participate in any and all academic, athletic and social programs that are offered during and after 
the school day. They are encouraged to participate in DEFOY (an after school program that supports academic enrichment and 
supports social skills building).  The students are encouraged to participate in the culinary program that we have available as 
well.  We recently implemented various student clubs after school. Our ELL's re included in these clubs and they have the 
choice to join which ever club they have an interest in.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
 At MS 181, the ELA department used code X to support the common core curriculum but the majority of the curriculum was 
created by the department. These units support the four modalities of the NYSESLAT as well as assist with ELA development. 
The math department uses CMP3 for their program. To support the students' ELA, math, and content area skills, computer 
programs are used by the student, individually, each working at their own level. Smartboards are used in classrooms to 
support all students as a way to add visualization to their lessons and become more interactive. Class sets of laptops are 
available for use, as well as access to the technology rooms when needed. Rosetta stone has recently been added as a way to 
add technology to the ENL program.  
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

 

At MS 181 there is no TBE and Dual Language programs. For the ENL program, students buddy up to encourage and support 
others in their native language. There are many Spanish speaking paraprofessionals in the building who offer their time to aid 
students that need native language support. The use of native language glossaries are available to the students as well as 
material in the content areas.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

The required services, support, and resources are aligned to correspond to the age and grade of the student. All effort is made 
so that the students who have limited proficiency in English do not feel as if they are reading  books that’s look like it's for 
much younger children. Instead the teachers here make every effort to find material that the students can understand yet still 
is on the same topic as their peers. Sometimes it is necessary to adjust the program to a different level, such as in the case of 
the SIFEs.       
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 At MS 181 we are not a collocation school. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
 There are no formal activities during the summer for newly enrolled ELL students, however, there is a back to school night for 
each grade during the start of the school year where all students and parents are welcome, including ELL's.  All ELL students 
are encouraged to take advantage of all the activities the school has to offer, both academic, athletic, and social. ELL's have the 
choice to become involved in any and all activities offered at the school . The principal always meets with any new ELL student 
that enrolls, and with the help of a translator if needed he welcomes the student and makes it known that if he can help them 
feel more comfortable or if they need more assistance with their work to come to him and he will help them. Making this 
initial contact with the new ELL student fosters the idea that they are valued and a part of the school.The guidance counselors 
at the school are there to assist any new 6th graders when they have trouble adjusting to middle school. They also speak to 
the students about their high school choices and what to expect in high school as they get ready to transition. They conduct 
meetings with the parents to help them with the transition as well.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish is the only language elective offered to all students at our school.      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

There is currently no dual language program offered at MS 181. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
  At the professional development sessions offered by the office of ELLs and other sources, all strategies are now aligned to 
meet the challenges of the ELL student with the common core in mind. Such professional development sessions include topics 
such as the use of sheltered instruction (SIOP model), total physical response, the use of graphic organizers to assist ELL 
students, vocabulary development, re-wording instructions by breaking them down into more simple parts, the use of audio/ 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

visual aids, and dramatization/ reader's theatre. These learning opportunities will equip teachers with the tools they need to 
deliver common core aligned instruction to their students. Monthly meetings are held at the district level for teachers of ELL's 
and it is encouraged to bring a content area teacher along with the ELL teacher so they can learn to better assist the students 
together effectively. The ENL teacher also attends RBERN professional developments and turn keys when necessary.   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
The ENL teacher meets with the subject area teachers at the beginning of and throughout the school year to recommend 
strategies to use with the ELLs in the classroom environment . As the student becomes more fluent in English, the ENL and 
classroom teachers meet periodically to reassess the level of performance that the student should be able to achieve 
successfully. The ENL teacher attends professional developments with the district ELL specialists and RBERN and turn keys the 
information to all teachers of ELLs and pertinent staff members. The teachers that work with the ELL students are occasionally 
invited to attend the ENL meetings and professional developments with the ENL teacher. Such professional development 
sessions include topics such as the use of sheltered instruction (SIOP model), total physical response, the use of graphic 
organizers to assist ELL students, vocabulary development, re-wording instructions by breaking them down into more simple 
parts, the use of audio/ visual aids, and dramatization/ reader's theatre. The records of professional development are 
maintained in the ENL compliance binder, located in the ENL teacher's office. Teachers on an individual level, maintain their 
own professional record that includes any PD they have regarding ELL achievement/growth. Professional Development 
Agendas are kept in the ENL Compliance Binder. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
MS 181 provides annual individual meetings with the parents of ELLS to discuss the goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas by 
calling parents during the parent engagement time to set up a meeting time with the ENL teacher. All efforts will be made to 
accommodate the parent's schedule. Phone conferences will be given if parents are not able to come during school time. For 
the Spanish speaking parents, there are staff members available in the building to assist with translation  and interpretation as 
needed. For all other language the translation and interpretation unit hotline is available for over the phone interpretation 
through the NYCDOE will be used. In addition, parents of new ELL students will be invited to orientation with the ENL teacher 
and Parent-coordinator. All parents are invited to the four scheduled PT conferences for the school year.    
 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents of all ELL students are encouraged to join the PA which meets monthly. During the school year these parents are 
invited to join in with their children and the school community to participate and celebrate in various academic and social 
events. Such activities include literacy, math, and family nights. Parents are notified of these events through the mail or 
Internet, as well as notices sent home with the student. The parent coordinator plays an important roll to the success of the PA 
and any parental involvement within our school. She serves as the liaison between the home and school community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christopher Warnock, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Home Language Survey we receive from the child's previous school (or from our school in the case of new 
admits), serve as our starting point. We also assess home language through ATS and discussions with our 
students' parents. The teachers provide the administration with information and feedback regarding their 
students as well. Due to our school’s historically low ELL demographic, the majority of family's at our school prefer 
to receive written notices in English. If and when it is needed, correspondence via written letters and oral 
translations are done with the assistance of staff members, and parent volunteers who speak the language as well 
(mainly Spanish). If we find translation and / or interpretation of another language is needed, our school will 
utilize the interpretation hotline or interpreters will be called in on an at need basis.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

School staff will reach limited-English-proficient families in the event of an emergency via telephone call from a staff 
member that speaks their language as well as Robocall.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.

Teachers are made aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 through meetings and turn key presentations 
employees that have attended the LAC meeting. The teachers are told about the interpretation line and given a flier 
with information on how to provide interpretation services for these families when needed. 

 

 
  

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

At M.S. 181 we believe in the importance of ensuring that all Limited English Speaking parents are provided with a 
meaningful opportunity to participate in and have access to programs and services, which is critical to their child's 
education as described by the Department of Education. In this regard, the school determines the primary language 
spoken by the parent of each student enrolled in the school and whether the parent requires language assistance 
within the required time frame. As described, the school provides interpretation services for parents at group and 
one-on-one meetings such as parent conferences upon request to ensure all parents communicate effectively with 
the school regarding critical information about their child's education. The parents are given a copy of important 
documentation, such as the "parents bill of rights" in their native language when needed. Signs are posted in the main 
office regarding parents bill of rights, interpretation notice signs and plans in their native language as well. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents have a welcoming and open dialogue with the teachers, administrators, and parent coordinator and usually 
feel comfortable sharing their feedback on all things school related through PA meetings, letters, or visits/ meetings 
with the school. The can happen at any time throughout the school year as well as during scheduled meetings and 
conferences. At MS 181 the parent survey is encouraged to be filled out to inform the school of any adjustments the 
parents feel we might need to make.
