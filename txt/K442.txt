Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

“MS 442’s mission is to empower globally conscious, critical thinkers for the 21 st century.”  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

MS 442 is a unique school community committed to high expectations for the academic achievement, social 
development, and personal growth of each of our students. We believe that each child should have an individualized 
education, that challenges students to engage in problem based learning, while engaging in asynchronous learning 
opportunities. Our educational philosophy is based on our belief that: 

● The most meaningful and enduring learning occurs when students choose to apply their new knowledge and skills 
to a real-world context and creativity To fostered through access to a variety of media; 

● Student success is dependent upon the critical partnerships between home and school, where communication and 
collaboration are paramount;  

● Promoting a culture of student driven, interdisciplinary projects will be the basis for creating civic minded, socially 
responsible community leaders; 

● On-going assessment, reflection, and goal setting allow educators to tailor responsive, individualized instruction to 
meet the specific needs of a diverse student population; 

● Co-curricular and extra-curricular activities for middle school students must balance the academic and social-
emotional needs distinctive to adolescent learners; 

● A culture of respect, acceptance, and understanding celebrates differences and serves as the foundation of our 
school community; 

● Responsibility for the environment is accepted by immersing students in practical studies on conservation and 
global sustainability.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

MS 442 serves approximately 32% students with special needs and 4% ELLs. While over 85% of students make growth 
on their AYP in math and ELA according to teacher-generated learning outcomes from state and Common Core 
standards, nearly 50% of these students are still scoring a level 3 or 4 on NYS math and ELA tests. These students need 
time in their day to receive additional support on mastering learning outcomes to help them to reach grade-level 
work.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The element of the Framework for Great Schools where MS 442 made the most progress this past year was in 
Rigorous Instruction. We’ve made great progress in individualizing instruction for a variety of learners. We were 
recognized as a Showcase School for “Supporting All Students through Innovative Instruction.” We strive to 
personalize learning for students by presenting them with purposeful challenging common core aligned curriculum.  

While we feel we have made strides in all elements of the Framework for Great Schools we will continue to focus on 
Strong Family-Community Ties. We would like to increase interaction with families while providing a variety of 
opportunities to cooperate with the MS 442 faculty.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
 

 

 

School leader, in collaboration with department heads, scheduled weekly department meeting and 
planning sessions to ensure appropriate Next-Generation-aligned instruction 

  Teachers created Next-Generation aligned learning outcomes with corresponding indicators, regularly 

assist students for mastery of these learning outcome, and design rigorous learning tasks to meet the needs 
of individual students. 

  Units are grounded in project based learning opportunities that allow for collaboration over different 

subject areas.  

  Teachers make use of their professional periods to plan three formative assessments per unit, with the 

incorporation of technology in one of those assessments to enhance writing instruction.  

  One of the three formative assessments for each unit will require students verbally express their ideas in 

forms of narration, video, voiceover, screencast, or other multimedia tool  

  Based on data analysis, in conjunction with low-inference teacher intervisitation observations, we realize 
there is a need to improve student-to-student discourse across all curriculum areas with a point of contact 
in ELA to generate and push growth.  

  Based on the 2016-2017 school NYSED school report card: 

o  6th Grade: 18 students with disabilities, 10 tested at a level 1 on the 3-8 ELA state exam, 5 students 

tested at a level 2, 3 students tested at a level 3, 0 students at a level 4. 

o  7th Grade: 18 students with disabilities, 4 tested at a level 1 on the 3-8 ELA state exam, 5 students 

tested at a level 2. 6 students with disabilities tested at a level 3, and 3 students tested at a level 4.  
  Based on the 2016-2017 ELA State test results 47.5% of total students met state standards on state ELA test 

with an average score of 2.87 out of 4.5.  

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 50% of students with disabilities, 50% of ELL students, and 75% of general education students will 
demonstrate growth toward mastery in Next Generation Speaking and Listening Standards, using three summative 
assessments per unit, with one of the three summative assessments requiring a verbal expression of ideas in forms of 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          12

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will shift unit planning to incorporate three key 
summative assessments throughout the unit, two of which will 
demonstrate reading and writing growth toward mastery, one of 
which will demonstrate speaking and listening growth toward 
mastery. 

 

Students will demonstrate their mastery of reading and writing 
standards with a traditional written task in conjunction with a 
technological component that supports diverse student 
strengths, learning styles, and revision of ideas. 

Students will continue to be flexibly grouped through the ELA 
units of study, based on formative and summative reading, 
writing, speaking data from in-class assessment as well as 
summative assessment data to target specific student challenges 
and provide a safe space for students to practice their speaking 
and listening.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 

 

 
  Teachers include and incorporate parents into the writing and revision process through e-mail and google 
sharing documents. Parents and students can see, in real time, teacher feedback and comments based on 
students approaching/mastery of specific standards through the first writing assignment aligned to a unit of 
study.  

  Teachers collect and organize a parent-information line of communication through email that addresses 
student learning and focuses on specific standards being taught. One email sent at the beginning of each 
unit to inform parents of standards, text/literature, and culminating assignments/projects.  

  Parents will continue to be invited to viewing parties and celebration upon completion of summative 

speaking and listening projects.  

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
Teachers in all content areas should continue to dedicate time for summative, written assessment in conjunction 
with their PBL. This means that a speaking and listening technology project in science class should accompany a 
written product by students evaluating or explaining said project. Most importantly, this written product is utilized 
in ELA classes (grades 6-8), evaluated using the same six writing learning outcomes teachers will use to also 
evaluate the benchmark assessments.  

 

ELA teachers will decide on department-wide grading norms and utilize department time/coaching meetings to 
analyze data, normalize grading, and assess student work. Teachers should then develop an action plan to address 
student findings, highlight growth, and target deficiencies. ELA classrooms will be expected to leverage the ICT 
model to target student deficiencies and dedicate human capital small group speaking and listening support, in 
addition to the regularly-expected duties of the general education and special education teachers. 

Teacher-generated mastery banks of video/screencasts, previous student mentor products, graphic organizers, 
templates, and rubrics will be shared and adapted across content areas to allow for continuity for student 
understanding. The ELA department head at 442 MUST ensure time and space for department-wide conversations 
around the evaluation of student work, the sharing of resources, and the norming of assessment.  

Teachers will participate in intervisitation (learning walks) throughout October, November, December, February, 
March, and april with the expressed purpose of observing other core-content teaching methods and to identify 
areas of pedagogical consistency, pedagogical overlap, and opportunities for collaboration.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths  

  While PD is offered in house, staff members are encouraged to take advantage of PD offered off premises as 

well. There are shared leadership roles that facilitate regular meetings where student work is analyzed. We 
have a team of social workers who facilitate workshops where the staff is given an opportunity to reflect on 
how they relate to their students. Our principal also provides the staff with time to develop inquiry work 
allowing them to dive deeply into their pedagogical practices.  

Needs 

  There is a need to better focus all of our different professional development types into cohesive goals 

throughout the year. The administration will work along department heads, coaches, and teacher leaders to 
aligning all professional development around one problem of practice to have the greatest impact to raise 
student achievement in all subjects areas.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, professional development of the school's staff will have been tailored to the needs of staff through an 
ongoing and responsive professional development calendar, in addition to the mid-year survey, that addresses the 
adaptive challenges presented to teachers as evidence through increased in mastery data.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

  Parent coordinator, teachers and office staff ensure that there is regular weekly communication between 

school and family by phone, email or school designed online platform. 

  Online grading platform and the Hive allows families and students to gauge an understanding of strengths and 

needs as well as opportunity to communicate concerns or set next steps. 

  We work with various Extended Learning Opportunities to open the walls to the students learning experience: 

The Beam Center, Wediko Children Services, Consultant from Office of School Mental Health. 

  We have a rejuvenated parent body and do many events to bring parents into the school to participate in 

Breakfast with the Principal events, view their children’s work during Project Expo, Partner with the PBIS team 
to organize events to build community etc.  

Needs 

  While we are a mastery based grading school there is a learning curve to understanding how this is different 
from a traditional grading model and the implications for each child. According to a 2018 family survey, over 
50% of families expressed the need for more support in fulling understanding the shifts in understanding their 
student's progress as well as how to support them to take advantage of mastery-based grading. When new 
families join our school community, it is imperative that they understand how the model works and its 
benefits to have the greatest impact on the achievement of their child.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

By the end of the 2018-2019 school year, MS442 will increase family participation in various school functions by 20% 
compared to 20117- 2018 school year by prioritizing training on Mastery Based Grading Practices for families.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement.

Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Carroll Gardens School for Innovation, in compliance with the Every Student 
Succeeds Act is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection 
and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep 
parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their 
children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I 
Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

Carroll Gardens School for Innovation will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title

inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The following formative assessments are used to guide instructional planning for our ELLs: 
 
• New York State Identification Test For English Language Learners (NYSITELL) 
• SPANISH LAB (where applicable) 
• New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) 
NYC Periodic Assessments for ELLs - Fall and Spring (6-8) 
NYC ELA Periodic Assessments - Fall, mid-year and Spring (6-8) 
 
• Teacher’s College Reading and Writing Workshop Program(TCRWP) Running Records 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

• TC Reading – Pre/Post Unit Assessments 
• TC Writing on Demand 
• Teacher-created assessments (all content areas) 
Initially, we examine the NYSITELL, SPANISH LAB, and/or NYSESLAT scores and other formal New York State and New York City 
assessments, along with the Teacher's College Comprehension and Decoding Literacy Assessments, to get an early impression 
of our ELLs language skills in all areas of learning. The data indicates that most students are at an Expanding or Commanding 
progression level in the Speaking and Listening modalities, but Entering through Expanding levels for Reading and Writing in 
English. Therefore the main focus and goals of our ENL program is to foster stronger literacy skills, strategies with content area 
vocabulary development and to teach social and academic language in unison. TC reading assessments have shown that long 
multi-syllabic words are challenging for our ELLs to acquire, interfereing with full reading comprehension. Discreet teaching of 
units with a focus on prefixes and and suffixes, other vocabulary learning skills, and grammar/mechanics topics has shown to 
be beneficial with improved fluency and comprehension. 
  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The ELL Coordinator consults with school leadership, academic coach and grade team leaders to provide initial data and most 
up to date ELL student info so that proper programming/scheduling of students can be completed. All teachers work to 
support this effort continuously by setting goals and monthly targets to ensure that these formative assessments are 
integrated in planning to drive instruction for the school year. Towards the end of the school year (early June), each grade 
team collaborates and builds a framework for the pacing calendars for the upcoming school year and forms the units for the 
grade curriculum and assessments to be administered. The ENL teacher is part of every grade meeting and works 
collaboratively to plan for the upcoming academic school year. Our school also schedules weekly small group intensive 
academic support sessions for all students. When necessary, ELLs receive additional RTI/AIS support classes with literacy 
support specialists (N.Green). 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 Twice a year, in the Fall and Spring, ELL periodic assessments are used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need. The 
Fall ELL periodic assessment are used to identify baseline info as well as any progress since the Spring's NYSESLAT and 
ELA/MATH results. The Spring ELL periodic assessments are used to assess progress as well as targeted areas of need. For the 
ELL population at MS 442, there is a strong urgency to support more of the reading and writing skills of the current ELL 
population in all grades. ELLs are also administered the baseline ELA periodic assessments (fall, mid-year and spring). 
 
These are the number of last year's MS442 students receiving Commanding level (2 of 11) or Expanding level (5 of 11) scores 
on the 2017 NYSESLAT. Our explicit instruction in ENL, ELA, and other Content areas for Reading and Writing skills and other 
key strategies has helped improve ENL student performance across the grades in all areas of learning. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

MS 442 has the following structures in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered: 
• All students have "intensive" classes as part of their schedule each week to address any intervention needs. These classes are 
small group learning dynamics dependent on the needs of the students. Grouping changes throughout the year based on 
needs. 
• The school offers teacher-student mentoring programs throughout the year to address academic and social/emotional needs 
of students 
• Additional ENL sessions scheduled for ELLs (up to 6 week scheduling upon review) should there be a need for interventions 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 MS 442 uses the following outcome assessments to evaluate and inform our ELL program 
• New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) 
• ELA 
• MATH 
 
On the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT one 6th grade student, and one of the 7th grade student were proficient in all areas of the 
NYSESLAT with a Commanding level score. All of our last year's ENL students, 4 are Newcomer ELLs, 7 achieved an equivalent 
Expanding or Commanding level score for the Speaking test. About half ( 4 out of 9) of last year's students' Listening scores 
appear to be in the Expanding level range across the grades. The areas that need the most support is in reading and writing. 
Most of the ELLs tested at Emerging to Transitioning in reading and writing. 
 
For the SPANISH LAB or NYSITELL results from the past 3 years our Newcomers have reading and writing skills that are not on 
grade level in their native language. Some have some proficiency with their listening skills but no productive speaking skills 
based on the 0 score in that modality. All the other scores were zeros or close to it across the modalities except for one 
student who scored at the Emerging level. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The ELL Coordinator/ENL teacher disseminates data findings to administration, school coach, and content area teachers of all 
the identified ELLs in the building. It is a comprehensive written document that outlines, students' stats, assessment results in 
each modality, overall progression levels and brief academic history/bio. The ELL Coordinator/ENL Teacher works with 
administration on programming based on the results of the findings/assessments to ensure that the best programming is 
implemented for the ELLs at the school. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Once all identification and parent choice surveys are processed and completed, the ELLs are 
programmed/scheduledin the ENL program which is currently the only program selection at MS 442. We have a small 
population of ELLs. Forthe 2016-17 school year, there was an average of 13 ELLs (4 at a Commanding progression 
level) in grades 6 to 8.The ENL program with 100% of instruction in English in an all ICT model where each class on the 
grade (each gradehas 3 classes) has 1 certified general education teacher and 1 certified Special education teacher. 
Currently, the ELLstudents are grouped heterogeneously according to grade level and class during both stand-alone 
and/or integratedENL services depending on progression levels. During the 2017-18 school year, ELL students were 
groupedhomogeneously during stand-alone sessions for example, Entering (Newcomer) level students were grouped 
togetherduring stand-alone sessions so we the school was able provide ample opportunities to develop vocabulary 
building, automaticity, and fluency skills for social and situational speaking in a lesser affective, small group setting. As 
per CR Part 154 those students at the Entering level receive 360 minutes of ENL support (180 min stand-alone /180 
min integrated) and instruction. Those students identified at an Emerging progression level receive 360 minutes of 
ENL support (90 min stand-alone /180 min of integrated, and 90 min of stand-alone or integrated) and instruction. 
Those students with a Transitional progression level will receive 180 minutes of ENL support (90 min integrated / 90 
min of either stand-alone or integrated) and instruction. Those students with an Expanding progression level receive 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

 

180 minutes of ENL with all 180 minutes with integrated ENL instruction. Those students with a Commanding 
progression level receive 90 minutes of integrated ENL instruction per week.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

           Currently, MS 442 has a Freestanding ENL program, therefore 100% of instruction is in English. With Newcomers, many 
classroom teachers will allow some native language use as a foundational support while the ELL student is acculturating into a 
new learning environment and country but besides that, it is explicit ENL instruction in English. The ELL Coordinator/ENL 
teacher and school leadership work closely to implement the ENL program into the school's core curriculum. Also, there is 
collaborative work and consultations with the programming director (L. Genduso) to ensure mandated instructional ENL 
service minutes are met. 
 
As indicated by the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT scores our ELLs identified at the Entering and Emerging progression levels will 
receive 360 minutes per week of ENL services (180 min integrated and 180 min of standalone). The Transitioning and 
Expanding progression level students will receive 180 minutes of ENL service (integrated). The Commanding progression level 
students will be provided with 90 minutes of ENL service per week (integrated). Students demonstrating an Expanding level 
will receive 180 minutes of integrated ESL instruction. The school follows the mandated instructional ENL service requirements 
per CR Part 154 based on assessed progression levels. The ELL Coordinator programs and schedules ENL services for all of the 
identified ELLs in the building and works with the school leadership team to ensure that the mandated number of instructional 
minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in our ENL program model. 
 
All ENL newcomers have four stand-alone sessions and/or four integrated ENL periods a week with additional one-to-one 
periods in the first month to transition them into a new learning environment.  Commanding level students are the only 
ELLs who have two integrated ENL periods per week. Each current ENL student also attends six small group Intensive periods a 
week, with ENL and/or other content area teachers, to comply with CR Part 154 mandates. All ENL students receive 8 full 46 
minute periods of ELA instruction per week. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 
Core content is delivered in English only in the ENL program model at MS 442. Instruction is provided during literacy lessons 
using ENL techniques, strategies and tools using the TCRWP model - Balanced Literacy Program and aligned with the Common 
Core Standards. Math and other content areas are differentiated for ELLs using ENL strategies and methods. Scaffolding 
consists of, but is not limited to: bilingual glossaries/dictionaries, interactive word walls, charts, graphs, manipulatives, and 
picture supported materials to teach vocabulary; strategy charts related to current units of study; various textbooks and trade 
books related to the experiences and interests of middle school grade learners, and inquiry based interdisciplinary projects to 
enable students to transfer key skills and concepts. ENL instruction also targets Common Core academic vocabulary and 
concepts to help make the challenging content more comprehensible. The Math and Science curriculum includes discreet 
literacy classesfor targeted content area vocabulary development specifically with ELLs in mind. In addition , the ENL teacher, 
S. Oh, provides integrated services during Technology, ELA, Science and Social Studies classes to support the students' class 
work and assist them in meeting the academic demands adhering to the CCLS framework. The ENL teacher collaborates with 
the content area teachers in modifying the project based curriculum to contextualize the content of each unit. The texts and 
main teaching materials for the projects of each unit (mainly ELA, Science and Technology) are used during stand-alone 
sessions as a foundation to align the ENL curriculum with the school's curriculum. Each of those content area classrooms have 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

been provided with bilingual glossaries for native language support for those ELLs who need it. Also, each ELL has a laptop 
provided throughout the school day so that they can apply various English language acquisition tools to complete their 
projects and assignments. ENL instruction is provided using an eclectic mix of materials including student produced materials, 
their independent reading books in English and native language (when applicable), materials derived from the main classroom 
curricula (scaffolding concepts for ELLs and special needs students), various pedagogical resources, such as English at our 
Command, Language Power, New York ELLs, and many Internet sources, for discrete topics in grammar, vocabulary 
(social/academic language) development, Imagine Learning (literacy software program for ELLs)and the Wilson program for 
some of our ELLs with special needs 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

MS 442 has an ENL program to offer ELLs as a language support service at this time. The school uses the SPANISH LAB (for 
those ELLs who have Spanish as a home language) to evaluate home language literacy skills initially. This formal assessment of 
Spanish literacy skills is administered within the first 10 days of school entrance administered by the ENL teacher, S. Oh and 
proficient Spanish speaker (usually M. Aviles-Hodges - Bilingual Guidance Counselor or R. Daley - Spanish Teacher) who have 
been trained to administer with a proctor such assessments. Besides the SPANISH LAB, the school does not evaluate ELLs in 
their home language throughout the year. Currently we do not have a TBE or Dual Language program. 
 
Should there be a need to evaluate home language other than Spanish for an ELL, the ELL's initial evaluation of Native language 
skills is done through an formal interview by the ELL Coordinator/ENL teacher, S. Oh, with parent along with other staff 
members fluent in those languages (as available in-house) such as M. Aviles-Hodges in Spanish, support from school leadership 
and with the support of the DOE offices such as the Translation and Interpretation Services. Formal evaluation of English 
language proficiency is provided by the ENL teacher using the NYSITELL for Newcomers within the first 10 days of their 
entrance to school and the NYSESLAT for continuing ENL students. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Based on the 2017 NYSESLAT results: 
There is a total of 11 ENL students. 
The breakdown is as follows: 
0 = SIFE (technically no SIFE), 4 = Newcomers, 7 = ELLs in years 4-6, 0 Long Term ELLs. 
Out of these numbers, 4 are Special Education ELLs. 
a. SIFE STUDENTS: These students will be provided the full range of academic based intervention services once initial 
assessment levels in main content areas are reviewed. Based on their needs SIFE students would be offered the following 
outside of their ENL instructional time. Differentiated instruction and support will be implemented during Intensive-small 
group instructional time, Mentoring sessions, Lunchtime clubs, Afterschool tutoring and clubs, Saturday school sessions, and 
other small group sessions, with additional opportunities planned using the technological support of the Imagine Learning ELL 
literacy software program on the computer and Books-on-Tape or CDs for audible support for leveled books, Fountas and 
Pinnell Levelled Literacy Intervention books series for reading comprehension and academic vocabulary development, New 
York Ready books targeting 
Math and ELA vocabulary, strategies, and skills. IPads and laptops are used throughout the school day for all content area 
classes to provide access to language learning tools/materials and provide visual support . An individual needs assessment will 
be made and a creation of a targeted intervention plan will be implemented with a focus on reading, writing, math, and other 
necessary content area components. 
b. NEWCOMER STUDENTS: These students are provided extra support by scheduling additional sessions of ENL services as 
Newcomers to support their acculturation into the school learning environment once their needs are assessed. The range of 
language acquisition support is scheduled during, differentiated intensive-small group instructional time, lunchtime clubs, 
Afterschool tutoring and club sessions, Saturday school sessions and other targeted small group sessions, with additional 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

opportunities planned using the technological support of the Imagine Learning literacy software program for ELLs on the 
computer, books-on- CDs or on-line for audible support for leveled books. Ipads and laptops are used for access to language 
acquisition tools/materials and visual support. Newcomers meet in additional small groups for Intensive and Mentoring 
sessions at least 5 times a week with ENL and/or ELA and other content area teachers. Work includes vocabulary (social and 
academic language) building, automaticity, and fluency skills, along with ELL Guided Reading and sight word development 
using the "1000 Most Common Words in the English Language" list, Fountas and Pinnell Literacy Intervention books, and 
appropriate level texts to help build comprehension skills. Word-to- word glossaries are available for use in the content aea 
classrooms for added support. The students are also encouraged to participate and join all school based activities and WEDIKO 
(after school organization) to increase their opportunities for language usage and development. 
c. DEVELOPING ELLS: Once ELL student data is assessed, instruction is differentiated in various ways for developing ELLs such 
as heterogeneous/homogeneous grouping, differentiated graphic organizers (varies by project/lesson/activity), access to 
bilingual glossaries and dictionaries and collaborative peer project leads and mentoring sessions. Since they are provided with 
a combination of stand-alone and/or integrated ENL services to support their work in the content areas, the ENL teacher 
collaborates with the content area teaches to differentiate instruction such as: vocabulary associated with the Common Core 
curriculum; prefix and suffix work to help decipher longer, more complex words in their reading; idioms study for reading 
comprehension; writing persuasive passages using text evidence; writing descriptive passages; small group sessions to 
continue development of receptive and expressive oral fluency and automaticity. These ELLs are also provided a full range of 
AIS services during Lunchtime, Intensive small group, Mentoring groups, Afterschool, and Saturday school. Technology, such as 
CDs, IPADs, and laptops, are available for audio and visual supports. Intensive small group enrichment and Mentoring sessions 
5 times a week with ENL, ELA and content area teachers. 
d. LongTerm ELLs:  These students will be targeted for additional ENL and AIS services during mandated Intensive small group, 
Lunchtime, Mentoring, Afterschool, and Saturday school sessions. Currently, half of our Long term ELLs have special needs 
with scaffolding and differentiated instruction planning on-going across the content areas. This is a team effort by ENL, ELA, 
Special education teachers, and Content area teachers meeting weekly to ensure these students meet language and content 
area goals. Some may receive targeted individual reading comprehension development sessions with the Supporting 
Adolescent Literacy program specialist, Ms. N. Green, to develop the necessary strategies and skills. 
e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status: 
Those students who have achieved a Commanding score on the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT exams will continue to receive 90 
minutes of ENL supports per week for the next two years, and continue to receive ELL modifications ( time and a half, and third 
readings on listening passages) on all New York State assessments for the next two years., through the Spring of 2019. They 
continue to participate in all ELL targeted AIS and Intensive small group enrichment activities. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
MS 442 school is an ICT model school with both a content area and special education teacher in every classroom with the 
exception of Music, Art, Spanish and Gym. For ELLs with special needs we use various pedagogical resources such as English at 
our Command, Reading Rewards, Great Leaps, and other Wilson program materials, Fountas and Pinnell Levelled Literacy 
Intervention program, Books-on-CD to provide audio support, along with internet sources on IPADs and laptops to provide 
visual support, for acceleration of English language development with ELL-SWDs. Discreet strategies and skill are taught along 
with content area vocabulary to accelerate language development and are charted on Word Walls and bulletin boards in each 
of the classrooms to ensure accessibility at all times for those students who need the visual support. To provide access to 
academic content in the content area classrooms we use a combination of scaffolding, bridging, and contextualization, with 
graphic supports such as charts, graphs, pictures, and photos, using iPADS and laptops for internet sources and translation 
support into native languages for those who need it. Grade level content area classroom materials are used, with 
differentiation and scaffolding, to ensure accessibility to grade level and Common Core curriculum. They are targeted during 
Lunchtime, Intensive small group, Mentoring, After school, and for other small group enrichment with ENL, ELA, and Special 
Education teachers. Scaffolding of content area subjects is an on-going team effort of ENL, ELA, Content area, and Special 
Education teachers through grades meetings, discipline meetings, and inquiry work. Differentiated instruction of the Common 
Core Standards and Danielson Framework for ELLs with special needs will be implemented throughout the year. Related 
services providers (Speech, OT and Counseling related services) both push-in and pull-out of the content area classrooms ELL-
SWD's to provide mandated services.   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The program model used throughout MS 442 is an ICT program. Students with IEPs are placed in ICT classrooms as mandated 
by their IEPs. General Education students' families choose to send their children to our school knowing that this is an ICT model 
school. Therefore all students are placed in ICT classes. Those ELLs with disabilities are provided with non-disabled peer 
models in every class for a least restrictive environment. ENL students are provided with non-ENL peers to model grade and 
age level vocabulary to help attain academic and non-academic English proficiency. ENL is taught at MS 442 with both 
integrated and stand alone services to allow for a flexible, least restrictive environment. Some curricula and instructional 
needs require push-in, whole group-general class attendance with ENL scaffolding occurring in the class. Other topics and 
curricula needs require pull-out small group instruction, occurring in the ENL room (shared RM 245), to develop and attain 
English proficiency. 
 
All school programs, curricular and non-curriculur, are available to all our students including the ELL-SWDs, to ensure they 
achieve their IEP goals, both social and academic, in the least restrictive environments. All students at MS 442, including ELL- 
SWDs, are grouped in various whole groups for content area classes and small groups for Intensive small group, Mentoring, 
WEDIKO, and After school clubs (sports, music, science, computer, theatre, etc.) to enable diverse groupings, including ELL-
SWDs with their non-disabled peers. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Literacy is taught using ENL techniques and tools aligned with the Balanced Literacy Reader's and Writer's Workshop Program. 
Math and other content areas are scaffolded for ELLs using ENL strategies and methods. Scaffolding consists of, but is not 
limited to: bilingual dictionaries, interactive word walls, charts, graphs, and pictures to each vocabulary; strategy charts related 
to current units of study; textbooks and trade books related to the experiences and interests of adolescent learners; and 
inquiry based interdisciplinary projects to enable students to transfer key skills and concepts. Mentoring and Advisory sessions 
meet weekly. To meet the needs of our ELL and ELL special education students our ELLs subgroups worked with ENL, ELA, 
Content Area, and Special education specialists, working on vocabulary building, automaticity, and fluency skills for social and 
situational speaking (Newcomers), ELL guided Reading amd sight-word development with the Dolch "1000 Most Common 
Words in the English Language" to build comprehension skills, and strategies and skills to ELA, Math, Social Studies, and 
Science for grade specific and Common Core content. In school, After school, and Saturday school test prep for all 
NYS exams/assessments (ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies) is provided and available to all students, including ENL and former 
ELL students. 
The regular classroom texts and lab books (Math, Social Studies, Science) are used during push-in sessions for content areas. 
Each of those content area classrooms have been provided with the Spanish version of the texts ( Math, Social Studies, 
Science) along with Department of Education Word-to-Word Glossaries for content area subjects (Math, Science, Social 
Studies) in Spanish, French, and Arabic. Classroom leveled books for ELA are available and students can have access to 
computers for translated materials in Spanish, French, or Arabic for audio and visual native language supports. Translation by 
paraprofessionals and other pedagogues is available in Spanish for native language support. AIS services are also available 
during Lunchtime help and After school classes for all content areas, individually and in small group, over the course of the 
year. Other aspects of our program are designed to ensure that ELLs will meet or exceed New York City and State standards. 
These supports include teachers actively scaffolding instruction, integrating elements of Teacher's College Literacy curricula, 
the Connected Mathematics Project3 (CMP), and the Common Core Curriculum, and participating in professional development 
with considerations for ELLs. Staff Professional Development meetings are held each Monday, as per the DOE/UFT contract, 
with consultants, to assess student needs and abilites, collaboratively plan instruction, explore professional materials, and 
conduct school-wide needs assessments, including instruction for all MS 442 teachers on how to scaffold and differentiate 
instruction for ELLs. Grade meetings occur weekly to collaboratively plan and discuss individual student needs and include how 
to assist ELLs as they transition from one school level to another. We implemented a series of Inquiry Team meetings and 
workshops involving all staff members to examine and address these special needs, and to aid development of differentiated 
instruction. On-going Professional Development workshops are conducted at the BFSC and DELLs events for ENL teachers on 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

the SIOP model, NYSESLAT and CR Part 154 changes, and for the Parent Coordinator and the secretaries to address the needs 
of our ELLs and their families, including the latest changes in available services. Workshops, such as "Navigating the High 
School Application Process for ELLs", and the latest changes in services in the Translation and Interpretation Unit information 
are made available for the Guidance Counselors. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This year we have developed a new program of Intensive small groups targeting a specific subset of skills and strategies 
matched to student needs. Our ELLs meet in Intensive small group meetings 5 times each week with ENL, content area, and 
special education teachers. This year we are continuing small group Mentoring sessions weekly, and daily Lunchtime support 
to meet the needs of our ELLs. This year we are continuing our Inquiry Team meetings and workshops involving all staff 
members to examine and address these special needs, and to aid development of differentiated instruction. We are 
implementing the Common Core Standards curriculum using the Danielson Domains and examining how, when, and where 
they reflect the needs of ELLs. We are continuing to examine multiple assessment approaches for the ELLs in alignment with 
our Mastery Based grading curriculum. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have discontinued our daily Extended Day AIS classes for targeted content area vocabulary development specifically with 
ELLs in mind. Through our on-going Inquiry work we discovered that it was more effective, with better results, to teach this 
vocabulary in context, within the regular content area class. We discontinued individual mentoring sessions in favor of small 
group to afford the Newcomers and newly transferred ELLs maximum oral language development opportunities. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 
Updated with changes in September 2017: 
The ENL program provides a teaching and learning environment that promotes equitable opportunities, respecting and 
celebrating the diversity of our students, staff, and community. The program meets the academic, physical, social and 
emotional needs of our ELL students. We have WEDIKO children's services on-site to support the social emotional needs of our 
ELLs. During our school day we offer all students, including our ELLs, the following services, supports and interventions: 
Intensive small group remediation in literacy, mathematics and science; family workshops on how best to support student 
success in content areas and with homework; life skills interventions, WEDIKO Children's services (our affiliated CCO) 
Homework Help; inter-mural sports teams (soccer, basketball, track, softball, volleyball, running, flag football); the school 
musical (performance, stage crew, media); instrumental music (violins, winds, drums, guitar); Yearbook, art portfolio 
preparation group; Excelerated math - Algebra, BEAM - hands-on technology, and specialized high school test prep. This year 
additional After school clubs include Video Games Technology, Low-Tech Gaming, Yearbook, Yoga, Circus Arts, and small Press 
Club. Also available to our ELLs are supplemental services such as Lunchtime Help, Saturday classes, and other AIS type 
sessions. Written notifications are sent home, in English and home languages, informing the parents of the availability of these 
services to all students, including ELLs. 
Homeroom teachers announce all curricular and extracurricular programs to all students, including ELLs, and written 
notifications are sent home in English, Spanish, and Chinese, to all students, including ELLs, about all extracurricular activities 
that require parental consent. Curricular services occurring during the regular school day, such as Intensive small group and 
Mentoring are assigned by administration to ensure all students, including ELLs, are included. WEDIKO and other After school 
activites are specifically recommended to ENL students and their families via written notifications (in English and translation) 
to ensure their inclusion and participation in the MS 442 community. 
Currently ELLs participate in these After school activities: WEDIKO ( 6 ELL students), Accelerated Math and Science (3 ELL 
students), the SHSAT prep class (4 ELL students), Art portfolio (1 ELL), Language in Play, Circus Arts, instrumental music (4 ELLs) 
(violins, winds, drums, guitar), sports (8 ELLs)(soccer, flag football, basketball, track), and GSA group. ELLs also participated in 
Robotics and the school musical. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

ENL is taught using an eclectic mix of materials including student produced materials, their independent reading books, 
materials derived from the regular classroom curricula (scaffolded for ELLs and special needs students), various pedagogical 
resources, such as English at Our Command, Rewards - reading program, and many internet sources, for discrete topics in 
grammar, vocabulary development, and Guided reading using the Fountas and Pinnell Levelled Literacy Intervention program 
for reading comprehension and vocabulary development, and Words Their Way for some of our ELLs with special needs. 
Technological support is provided to Newcomers with iPADs and laptops using Google Translate and the Imagine Learning 
language program on computer and is available for all ELLs through the use of online Books (Imagine Learning program) to 
audibly support the independent reading books. Some grade level books are available in Spanish, French, and Arabic versions. 
Content area texts and materials are scaffolded for ELLs. In addition, there are Spanish versions of the text available in the 
classrooms with some available on-line in translation or using Google Translate. Internet sourced materials can also be used in 
translation where available. DOE Word-to-Word Glossaries are available in Spanish, Arabic, and French for the content areas. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

MS 442 recognizes the importance of native language support in developing English proficiency. We offer native language 
support, when necessary, and have continued to build a library of bilingual and native language books in Spanish, French, and 
Arabic, and access to online translated books, which are made available to ELL students and their parents. Each of the content 
area classrooms have Spanish versions of the texts and there are DOE Word-to-Word Glossaries in each of the content area 
classes in Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese. The Freestanding ENL program offers 100% of instruction in English with occasional 
modelling in native languages (with the support of a proficient educational paraprofessional or classroom teacher).  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Until Spring 2013 the Writing portion of the NYSESLAT required a different type of essay to be written according to the ages 
and grade band-widths of the students. In the 7th & 8th grade exam the essay was a compare and contrast essay requiring a 
minimum of 4 to 5 paragraphs. The 5th & 6th grade band required a different type of essay, not compare and contrast, often 
about the environment, ecology, or conservation, usually requiring a 3 paragraph essay. In 2014 the format changed to align 
with the Common Core curriculum. They included 2 writing assignments for all students grades 3-12. They were a short 
descriptive paragraph based on a photograph, and a fact-based or data-based essay based on at least 2 pieces of content area 
articles or graphs and charts, from which they need to illicit information, draw conclusions, make inferences, etc. 
In 2015 they changed the NYSESLAT formate again from the Reading portion of that day's exam. Our ENL classes will continue 
to work towards scaffolding and supporting the Common Core curriculum for all our ELLs, grades 6 through 8, with continued 
practice of data-based work. In an ICT model - the school curriculum is planned by all teachers with ELLs, Special Education 
students, and ELL-SWDs in mind. The ENL teacher plans with content area teachers to modify, scaffold and contextualize 
content area materials. Technology such as iPADS/Laptops (Imagine Learning program), translated learning materials, Google 
Translate, and other Internet sources that are used for auditory and visual support to ensure that all curriculum is made 
comprehensible based upon ELLs' ages, grade and progression levels. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
 ENL is taught using an eclectic mix of materials including student produced materials, their independent reading books, 
materials derived from the regular classroom curricula (scaffolded for ELLs and special needs students), various pedagogical 
resources, such as English at Our Command, Reading Rewards, and many internet sources, for discrete topics in grammar, 
vocabulary development, and Guided reading using the Fountas and Pinnell Levelled Literacy Intervention program for reading 
comprehension and vocabulary development, as well as Words Our Way for some of our ELLs with special needs. 
Technological support is provided to Newcomers with IPADs and laptops using Google Translate and the Imagine Learning 
language program on computer and is available for all ELLs through the use of translated on-line books to audibly support the 
independent reading books. Some grade level books are available in Spanish, French, and Arabic versions. Content area texts 
and materials are scaffolded for ELLs. In addition, there are Spanish versions of the text available in the classrooms with some 
available on-line in translation or using Google Translate. Internet sourced materials can also be used in translation where 
available. DOE Word-to-Word Glossaries are available in Spanish, Arabic, and French for the content areas. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

MS 442 schedules orientations in August for all new students and their families, including ELLs and their parents, with 
translation available in Spanish, French, Italian, and Arabic. These orientations are conducted by the Parent Coordinator, Gina 
Keller, Monserrate Aviles-Hodges, Bilingual Guidance Counselor, and the administrators (N. Mills and J.James). Students are 
encouraged to join our After school clubs and activities, school sports teams, and WEDIKO After school program, to integrate 
into the MS 442 community. All ELLs, including new ELLs, participate in Intensive small group and Mentoring groups with ENL, 
content area, and/or special education teachers. In addition, new ELLs are encouraged to join all of the school and after school 
activities that are planned at the start of the school year (sports, arts, theater, music. tech etc.). 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Currently, Spanish language classes are continuing to be offered to all our students on a twice-weekly basis. This is not an 
elective. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

Paste response to question here:  n/a  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
All pedagogical staff members work monthly with our consultant, Cornelius Minor, from Teacher's College, to ensure 
teachersreceive support in scaffolding the Literacy (TC) curriculum for our ELLs and in differentiating instruction for our ELLs 
withspecial needs. In addition teachers attend workshops at Teachers College on various topics including supporting work with 
ELLs and on ELLs meeting the Common Core Standards. Other aspects of our program are designed to ensure that ELLs will 
meet or exceed New York City and State standards. These supports include teachers actively scaffolding instruction, 
integratingelements of Teachers’ College Literacy curricula, Math support, Tech suppot and the Common Core Curriculum with 
ongoing support from the TC Literacy Coach, AIS and Curriculum (ELA, Math, Science, Social Studies) Coordinators, Allyson 
Nussar, ELA Coach, and Lisa Genduso, Math Coach, and by participating in professional development with considerations for 
ELLs. Staffplanning meetings are held each week, along with Inquiry half days each month, to assess student needs and 
abilities, collaboratively plan instruction, explore professional materials, and conduct school-wide needs assessments, 
including instruction for all MS 442 teachers on how to scaffold the Common Core curriculum and differentiate instruction for 
ELLs in all the content areas. Some of the TC workshops our teachers will attend this year include: Tool kits for Supporting 
Diverse Learners, Small Group Work that can really Move Readers, Teaching into Text Complexity, Academic Language, Learn 
from National Think Tank on Supporting ELLs, Building 6-8 grade Non-Fiction Skills with Informational Texts for ELA, Social 
Studies, and Science, and Preparing for Middle School exams for students with targeted needs. In addition, staff members 
participate in various off-site professional development sessions to support our work with ELLs. The ENL teachers attended 
workshops at: the Network for NYSESLAT and CR Part 154 changes; Using the SIOP Model with ELLs; at Teacher's College on 
supporting ELLs; and at New York University and Fordham's R-BERN division, to support our work with the ELLs. 
 
Mandated professional development requirements, according to CR Part 154.2, include 15% total hours of ELL-specific PDs 
forall teachers and 50% of total hours of ELL-specific PDs for ENL teachers. Therefore, all pedagogical staff members will work 
monthly with our consultants, Cornelius Minor, from Teacher's College, to ensure teachers receive support in scaffolding the 
Balanced Literacy curriculum for our ELLs and in differentiating instruction for our ELLs with special needs. Other aspects of our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

program are designed to ensure that ELLs will meet or exceed New York City and State standards. These supports include 
teachers actively scaffolding instruction, integrating elements of Teachers’ College Literacy curricula, the Math (Engage NY) 
and the Common Core Curriculum with ongoing support from the TC Literacy Coach, AIS and Curriculum (ELA, Math, Science, 
Social Studies) Coordinators, Allyson Nussar, ELA Coach, and Lisa Genduso, Math Coach, and by participating in professional 
development with considerations for ELLs. Staff planning meetings are held each week, along with Inquiry half days each 
month: to work with consultants, to assess student needs and abilities, collaboratively plan instruction, explore professional 
materials, and conduct school-wide needs assessments, including instruction for all MS 442 teachers on how to scaffold the 
Common Core curriculum and differentiate instruction for ELLs in all the content areas. In addition, ENL teachers have 
attended and will attend workshops at Teacher's College on various topics related to aligning instruction to the Common Core 
for ELLs specifically. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Grade meetings occur weekly to collaboratively plan and discuss individual student needs and include how to assist ELLs as 
they transition from one school level to another. Our Guidance Counselors, Monserrate Aviles-Hodges and LaShawn Ford, 
attend several High School processing workshops, including the "Navigating the High School Application for ELLs" workshop , 
each year, to learn about the new High Schools and find out about the latest changes in the application process. They attended 
a workshop on the SEMS website for the High school enrollment process. They then turn-key the information to all our 8th 
grade students and their parents at a series of four 8th grade parent meetings. These meetings are given on a Saturday 
afternoon in November, during the day, and several evenings in November, to ensure maximum student and parental 
participation. They meet individually with all 8th graders and with our ELL parents to aid them in the process and teach them 
how to navigate the website and give support during the HS application process. Ms Aviles -Hodges translates for the Spanish 
speaking parents when necessary. 
A minimum of 15% of the required professional development hours for all teachers will be dedicated to language acquisition 
including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction for ELLs. ENL 
teacher will dedicate 50% or more of required professional development hours to language acquisition in alignment with core 
content area instruction including a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content 
instruction for ELLs. 
Staff members participate in various off-site professional development sessions to support our work with ELLs. For our NEST 
Program, which includes ELLs, currently 2/3 of all staff members including administration, coaches, guidance, teachers 
including Speech & ENL, Occupational, counselors and paraprofessionals, have attended ASD workshops at New York 
University and Hunter College to better support these students. On-going professional development for this program includes 
additional workshops off-site and on-site with visiting consultants including specific workshops on ELLs in the NEST and weekly 
Case Conferencing. 
As per the DOE/UFT contract each Monday full-staff Professional Development sessions include how to scaffold the Common 
Core curriculum and differentiate instruction for ELLs in all content areas. Work with consultants to assess student needs and 
abilities, collaboratively plan instruction, and explore professional materials with ELLs in mind. In addition ENL teachers have 
attended workshops at the Network including a series of workshops on Using the SIOP model with ELLs, NYSESLAT format and 
scoring changes, and CR - Part 154 changes. ENL and other teachers also attend off-site workshops at Teachers College for 
developing academic and Common Core language, strategies, and skills with middle school students including ELLs. 
On-going Professional Development workshops are conducted at the Region for the Parent Coordinator, the paraprofessionals, 
and the secretaries to address the needs of our ELLs and their families, including the latest changes in available services. They 
attend various workshops where, among other things, the use of Translation and Interpretation Services Unit information is 
explained. Secretaries participate in PDs and workshops at the Region and Central that include ATS training for: pupil 
accounting for admitting, discharging, and transferring students, including ELLs; admission routines pertaining to ELLs such as 
HLIS, medical, busing, and residency requirements, and accessing the DOE Translation and Interpretation services. Records of 
staff attended PDs and other workshops, including those pertaining to ELLs, are maintained by school administration. The 
administration will maintain an "ELL Folder of Critical Documents " for all ELL related documents including a list of PDs

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 
As per the DOE/UFT contract, Tuesday afternoons are set aside for Parental Involvement. Parent meetings are made on an 
individual basis with Content area, Special Education, and ENL teachers, for all students, including ELL students, as need arises, 
to discuss individual student goals, student progress in language development, language proficiency assessment results, and 
language development needs in all content areas. Translation and Interpretation Services are available for assistance with 
translation in Spanish and Arabic. Spanish translation is provided by pedagogical staff members.  There is at least one ELL 
parent engagement meeting scheduled each year which is outside of the mandated parent-teacher conferences. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
MS 442 schedules orientations in September for all new parents, including ELL parents, conducted by the Parent Coordinator, 
Gina Keller. These sessions include equal access to our ELL parents with native language translation materials and staff 
interpreters, currently available in Spanish and French. For other languages, the school uses the DOE Translation and 
Interpretation Services will be contacted if other languages are needed. We (ENL teacher, Guidance Councelors, Parent 
Coordinator) also schedule orientations in the Fall for the families of new ELLs, with translation available in Spanish, French, 
and Arabic., and during the school year, when necessary to familiarize them with the New York State standards, various New 
York State assessments, including the ELA, Math, Science, NYSESLAT and New York State Regents exams, school expectations, 
and general program requirements for our ELLs. Translation is made available by staff in Spanish, French, and Italian based on 
parental needs assessment surveys completed by ELLs families at the start of the school year. DOE Translation and 
Interpretation Services are contacted for assistance with other languages.  The ENL teacher and Parent Coordinator also 
participate in the School Curriculum Night and Parent-Teacher Conference Days and Nights for the purpose of school - family 
collaboration. We offer bi-monthly "Breakfast with the Principal" events for parents to come in to receive info on school on-
goings and pertinent middle school news. 
 
In addition, families of ELL students are invited by written notifications in English, Spanish, and Arabic, and welcome to attend 
all Parent-Teacher Association meetings throughout the year. Translation is available upon request and based on needs 
assessment surveys. On-going parent workshops are held to address various issues and concerns as they arise. The following 
sessions are scheduled annually to assist parents with supporting their children: September:General Orientation and 
Parent/Student Handbook Overview; November: Assessments, Standards, and Report Cards; January: Supporting Students at 
Home; March: Monitoring Student Progress; and May: Promotional Criteria.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Noreen Mills, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At the beginning of each academic year any new student entering the New York City school system for the first 
time completes the HLIS form as part of the Registration packet. On part 3 of the HLIS the parents indicate their 
preferred language(s) for oral and written communications with the school and teachers. Also a Parent Needs 
Assessment Survey and the DOE Blues Cards are distributed to every student's home inquiring about preferred 
oral and written communications. ATS reports (REXH, RLAT, RLER) are also examined to determine which students 
are ELLs or former ELLs and which language(s) are listed as their home language(s). Once the Parent Surveys and 
Blue cards are returned to the school the information is turn-keyed to the SLT, who compile a Needs Assessment 
for the school. Then the information is disseminated to the entire staff so all pedagogues, service providers, 
paraprofessionals, office personnel, and administrative personnel are aware of the parental needs of their 
student's families for translation.
