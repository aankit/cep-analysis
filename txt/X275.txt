Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

With a belief that all children can learn, the mission of the High School of Computers and Technology will be to create 
an environment where students can prepare for a career in the computer industry while earning a Regents Diploma 
and building a foundation to further their education in college or post secondary technical school. Mutual respect, 
understanding, value for community, and a quest for knowledge will serve as guiding principles for our students and 
staff. All instruction will be interdisciplinary and hands on through project-based education. All members of the school

community will be able to clearly articulate the aspirations of our school and its mission and be equally responsible 
for the development of our culture and the achievement of our goals.  

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The High School of Computers and Technology is a small school of approximately 650 students,including 8% ELL and 
28% students with disabilities. We are located in the Evander Campus along with five other small schools. Our 
dedication to our students and commitment to providing excellent education has produced a great deal of success, 
which we feel can be attributed to three characteristics which collectively set us apart from any other school in the 
city;  

We were the first new Career and Technical Education (CTE) school to be opened in the city in over 20 years. 
Primarily, this means that we provide our students with the skills and knowledge in computer repair and technology 
that will make them competitive in the workforce. More than this, however, technology pervades everything we do in 
our school; every classroom is equipped with SMART boards and multi-media devices; laptop carts are available for 
daily use; we provide Quizdom and Senteo remotes and purchase on-line resources to enhance learning in the 
classrooms. The workshop model that makes CTE classes so engaging for students is infused into every classroom so 
that even academic classes are student-led and project-based. The CTE model flavors our entire school and ensures 
not only that our students learn competitive skills in computer repair but receive the education necessary to succeed 
in college, a primary concern of our academic program and heavily encouraged by the school as a whole. 

Our status as a small school ensures that students receive the individual attention they require to be successful in 
high school. Teachers know the names of our students and meet with parents regularly. After-school clubs and 
tutoring keep many of our students in school hours after the last class has ended. Every staff member – from our 
teachers to our administrators to our secretaries to our school aides – connects with our students and encourages 
them to do their best. Our size is the best asset we have to be sure that our students do not fall through the cracks. 

Our school culture is collaborative and empowering, not only for our staff but for our students as well. Grade teams 
meet on a daily basis to discuss curriculum, assessment and student issues. Teachers are given a great deal of 
autonomy and are creative with their instruction. Students have many opportunities for leadership as well, from our 
very active student government to our clubs and sports teams. Our atmosphere encourages self-exploration and 
allows anyone who wants to, to stand out and be counted. 

We have several programs and partnerships that influence our culture and academic environment greatly, none 
perhaps more significant than our involvement with SkillsUSA. SkillsUSA is a partnership of students, teachers and 
industry working together to ensure America has a skilled workforce. SkillsUSA helps each student excel. SkillsUSA’s 
mission is to empower its members to become world-class workers, leaders and responsible American citizens. 
SkillsUSA improves the quality of America’s skilled workforce through a structured program of citizenship, leadership, 
employability, and technical and professional skills training. SkillsUSA enhances the lives and careers of students, 
instructors and industry representatives as they strive to be champions at work. At HSCT, students are encouraged to 
compete in a wide range of competitions. For example, in the Computer Maintenance Technology competition, 
students are required to identify and correct end-user computing issues including configuration problems, operating 
system failures, boot issues, basic client side network problems and install common software components. Other 
competitions like Job Demonstration A, requires contestants to demonstrate an entry-level skill used in the 
occupational area for which they are training. Mobile Robotics is one such competition where students utilize their 
design and engineering skills to build and program a robot based on the theme of the year. As a SkillsUSA school 
chapter, we encourage students to take up leadership roles where they conduct meetings to improve our local 
communities. Students work in their competitions year around after school and compete in a citywide and statewide 
competition. Students that place first in their competition move on to compete at the national level against fifty four 
teams and more than 6,000 outstanding career and technical education students –– all state contest winners –– that

compete hands-on in 100 different trade, technical andleadership fields. HSCT is currently preparing to go to the 
state competitions where, if they win like they did last year, they will continue to compete at the national 
competitions. 

 

In addition, another program that enhances and informs our academic culture is our Robotics club. The High School 
of Computers and Technology is an active member of FIRST Robotics. Our team, 743, helps build science and 
technology skills and interests in addition to building self-confidence, leadership, and life skills amongst its students.  

The FIRST Robotics Competition challenges teams of students and their mentors to solve a common problem in a six-
week timeframe using a standard "kit of parts" and a common set of rules. Our team builds a robot from the parts 
and enters it in a series of competitions that involve not only the operation of other robots, but also presentation of 
a variety of other associated team activities, including computer animations, activities to increase the appreciation of 
science and technology throughout the school and community, and involvement in community service activities. The 
goals of the program include an increased awareness and interest in science and technology, increased college going 
and potentially a focus on science and engineering careers, and the development of a set of attitudes and skills 
described by the program as “gracious professionalism” – the ability to work together within a team and to work 
cooperatively with those on other teams, including potential competitors.  

 

 

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The High School of Computers and Technology serves 28% students with IEPs and 8% English Language Learners, 
including students with dyslexia, cognitive delays, reading levels far below grade level, physical and emotional 
impairments, as well as language acquisition challenges. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

According to the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot, The High School of Computers and Technology was rated

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the 2016-17 School Quality Snapshot, students entering 9th grade at a level 3 or 4 graduated at a rate of 
87%, while their Level 1 peers graduated at a rate of 57%. The priority need is to increase reading levels among 
students entering high school at a Level 1, so as to provide them better access to rigorous work in all content areas. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students in the Literacy RTI tier II target group will increase reading levels by one grade level, according to 
the San Diego Quick Assessment and the QRI6.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. According to STARS, the school-wide scholarship rate (passing rates for courses) for 2017-18 Term 2 was 62%, but 
there was wide variance across disciplines (e.g. 55% in science vs. 87% in Career Development).  

2. According to HSCT's 2017-18 Quality Review, the Area of Focus is 2.2: Assessment. According to the reviewer, 
"Assessment data doesn't drive adjustments. Teachers aren't tracking data in groups to make adjustments to the 
curriculum." Further, on the Student Perception Survey 61% of students responded favorably that "the teacher gives 
me feedback that helps me learn." 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, end-of-year school-wide scholarship rates (passing rates for courses according to STARS) will increase 2% 
from 62% to 64%.

According to the NYC DOE Office of Post-Secondary Readiness, “at least 1.7 million students do not file a FAFSA 
because they believe themselves to be ineligible. It has been estimated that $50 million in Pell Grant Awards are 
untapped by New York City students that would have been eligible had they filled out a FAFSA.” Additionally, due to 
recent federal changes to the FAFSA completion timeline, it is imperative that parents and students are aware of the 
changes.

qualified. In 2017-18, the School Quality Guide indicated a teacher attendance rate of 97%. With low teacher 
turnover, the school has been doing an excellent job of both attracting and retaining highly qualified teachers and 
continuously strives to do so. HSCT is committed to continued support and development of our highly qualified 
teachers as well. We work over 60 hours of professional development into our normal school year designed towards 
keeping teachers updated on current pedagogy and citywide initiatives. In addition, teachers are encouraged and 
supported in seeking professional development sponsored outside of the school by such entities as colleges and 
universities, school networks, private education companies and DOE-sponsored events. The school also supports new 
teachers through a mentorship program that pairs new teachers with experienced coaches, relationships that often 
extend beyond the initial mentorship year . 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
At HSCT, the cabinet (Principal, 3 APs) actively monitors data for trends in teacher and student performance 
(scholarship reports, Advance observation data, OORS report data, etc). These trends are discussed, along with 
teacher concerns, during Extended Cabinet bi-weekly meetings which consist of administrators, a guidance counselor, 
social worker, team leaders, and discipline leaders. This Extended Cabinet then works to create meaningful PD guided 
by teachers and teams.

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teacher teams with designated leaders review educational research to determine appropriate assessment measures 
for each content area, as well as the Common Core Learning Standards. Rubrics from CCLS-rich sites such as Engage 
NY are adapted and utilized to meet the needs of all students, including those with IEPs and ENL students. Formative 
assessment measures are reviewed, adapted, and tested in the classrooms and teacher teams analyze the outcomes 
for their next steps. Professional development is an outgrowth of the teacher surveys, observations based on the 
Danielson Framework for Teacher Effectiveness and identified student needs. Instruction and assessment go hand-in-
hand and we spend considerable time on our professional development to ensure that our assessments are 
measuring what we are teaching in the classrooms, content, skills, and process. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The High School of Computers and Technology, in compliance with the Section 
1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-
making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School 
Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of 
the school community. 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

 

The High School of Computers and Technology will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology;

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

The High School of Computers and Technology, iin compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of 
student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and

Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

HSCT’s ENL supplemental program is twofold, on one end supporting a morning language 
intensive ENL program that provides targeted small group instruction to ELLs to help them meet 
proficiency in English, while the afternoon program is organized to target ENL students 
struggling with Global, Algebra, and Living Environment Exams.  
Analysis of student performance indicated that more than 65% of our current ELLs scored at the 
Expanding proficiency level in the Spring 2017 NYSESLAT.  In order to sustain such success, 
HSCT plans on offering a before-school Title III program that will target the 32% of ELLs that 
scored between the Entering and Transitioning levels.  This program will start in October and 
continue through until March, for fifty sessions, five days a week, from 7:25 AM to 8:20 
AM.  One certified ENL teacher will provide instruction to approximately 15 students.  The 
program is an English Immersion course which emphasizes contextual clues and grammar and 
vocabulary adjusted to proficiency levels.  Students receive comprehensible input with regard to 
grammar, vocabulary, discourse skills, and native language support.   
During this course, the ENL instructor aims to develop reading, writing, and language 
acquisition skills of struggling ELL students in preparation for the NYSESLAT through the 
following modality-intensive methods: 
a. Guided Reading Groups - In cohorts based on reading levels, students take turns reading texts 
and discuss comprehension and grammatical and structural aspects of the passages.  Reading and 
writing progress is recorded and data analysis is utilized to inform instruction. (ie., round-robin, 
running record) 
b. Cooperative/collaborative groups - Students are also arranged in mixed groups to encourage 
positive interdependence and collaboration.   
c. Oral/Speaking Exercises - Students practice conversational skills by discussing comprehension 
of texts as well as targeted oral practice through specific prompts and direct instruction of 
idiomatic and everyday American Standard English.       
d.Essay/Academic Writing - Students practice persuasive and argumentative writing through 
scaffolded prompts and activities.  
e. Standards-based assessments - The ENL instructor plans for this program utilizing both CCLS 
and NYS ESL standards.  
Thorough analysis of ELL regents performance using the EDAT indicates that our ELLs have 
the most difficulty passing the Global, Living Environment, and Algebra regents exams.  As 
such, HSCT will target these students (16 ELLs for Global, 13 ELLs for Algebra, and 12 ELLs 
for Living Environment) by implementing an after-school program on Wednesdays to Fridays, 
starting from October and ending in March, for 50 sessions.  The program will operate from 3:00 
PM to 4:00 PM and will be serviced by one certified ENL teacher and three content-area teachers 
(1 per subject).  On Wednesdays the ENL teacher will co-teach with a Global teacher; on 
Thursdays the ENL teacher will team-teach with an Algebra teacher, and Friday’s integrated 
instruction will be provided with a Living Environment certified teacher.  The ENL teacher will 
co-plan with core-curriculum instructors in order to provide content-based ENL instruction that 
assists ELLs with regents specific tasks.  Furthermore, co-teachers will collaborate to make 
content-specific vocabulary and texts accessible to students through scaffolded

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
instruction.  Integrated instruction will also be strongly supplemented through utilization of 
ELLs’ native language support, by using word-to-word bilingual dictionaries and glossaries.  
Parents will be notified of students’ attendance through letters and calls home, with our school 
staff available for translation during home-calls as well as for translating notifications; the NYC 
DOE Translation & Interpretation Unit will furthermore be contacted in the event that the 
necessary translators are unavailable; all records of attendance and notifications will be kept in a 
file in the ENL teacher’s classroom. 
Assessments will include regents tasks (multiple choice and short answer response questions) 
and in-class formal observations recorded by the ENL teacher.  This information and students’ 
progress in the course, along with other relevant data will be shared with students’ corresponding 
regents teachers to inform their instruction. 
For the before-school program, Title III funds will additionally be used in our supplemental 
program to purchase academic writing textbooks and basil readers, as well as some new high 
interest low level novels.  Materials utilized for the after-school program will consist of text-
book materials, test-prep materials, glossaries and dictionaries, and multi-media, at no cost to 
Title III funds.

Begin description here:            
On-going professional development for Title III instructors and for ENL related topics as they 
pertain to staff services in 2018-2019 serves to (a) enhance Title III Global, Algebra, and Science 
after-school instructors’ knowledge of TESOL strategies, (b) to keep the Title III ENL teachers 
aware of new techniques, teaching strategies, and resources which will then be disseminated to 
relevant staff, (c) to increase advocacy for ENL students through enhanced awareness and 
training of staff members, and (d) to increase ENL students’ language proficiency and attainment 
of regents’ diplomas.  
Of the teachers in the Title III program, the ENL teacher and Science, Math, and Global teachers 
will attend monthly PDs provided by the Bronx Borough Field Service Center (BFS), the 
Division of English Language Learners and Student Support (DELLSS), and the UFT’s English 
as a Second Language/Bilingual Committee (ESLBC).  Selection of topics and PD sessions will 
be made available as these groups post dates in their email lists. 
At no cost to the Title III funds, our ENL teachers will provide 8 PD sessions in the 2018-2019 
school year, both individually and in collaboration with the Title III global and science teachers 
for different sessions.  The goal of these sessions will be to assist mainstream teachers in 
delivering instruction to ELLs by providing them with techniques, resources, and best practices, 
as well as making them readily aware of updated information regarding who students are and 
their background (native language and country, English proficiency level, learner preferences), 
and what available translation services there are for expanding their own parent outreach 
strategies.  
Additionally, as major exams arise (Regents and NYSESLAT) making teachers aware of 
logistics and student accommodations should enable teachers to adjust instruction for ENL 
students accordingly. Training staff in TESOL strategies will positively impact ELLs as it will

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
The ENL instructor, along with corresponding translators from our staff and the Translation & 
Interpretation Unit will engage parents by hosting a total of four hour long mini-seminars on 
select Saturdays (that are based around parent available determined by surveys), where they learn 
about how to support their children to improve reading, writing, and English acquisition skills.  
Bilingual interpreters (obtained through our school staff and the Translation & Interpretation 
Unit) are used to assist the ENL instructor during these seminars and with notifying parents of 
these events via phone and letter. In addition to notifications sent home, parents are notified of 
these mini-seminars through routine phone calls, during progress report calls, during parent-
teacher conferences, and through phone calls made by the ENL teacher/staff and auxiliary 
translators prior to the seminars. 
Via flyers and phone calls, parents are also informed of teacher/school expectations, curriculum 
standards and benchmarks, and their rights regarding access to interpreters and translated 
materials from HSCT, free lunch programs, the school’s ENL curriculum, supplementary school 
services available to their children and more.  During these sessions, parents of Title III students 
and ENL students will be provided with a presentation as well as hand-outs in their native 
languages that pertain to the information disseminated during that particular day (with topics 
elaborated upon below).  Also, after the first session parents will be provided with survey 
documents allowing them to request information they need and explain how proceeding sessions

can more adequately assist them.  Other staff utilized for the below-mentioned sessions are Ms. 
Jessica Torres, our school’s College Adviser who is fluent in Spanish, our school’s Parent 
Coordinator and Language Access Coordinator Ms. Heather Francis, and the Title III Global and 
Science teachers, who will attend the session that introduces parents to the after-school program. 
Some of the best practices shared with parents during these conferences include the following: 
oral storytelling in the native language to develop vocabulary and oral language skills, discussing 
stories with their children through wordless picture books, checking their children’s homework, 
increasing communication with teachers and school staff, making frequent trips to the public 
library, engaging their children in meaningful conversations when possible, watching educational 
children’s television programs together, reading bilingual books (including where to find them), 
and encouraging their children to find tutors.

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Formative assessments include students' teachers report cards, informal assessments throughout the year, and assessments 
conducted by our ENL teachers at periodic points during the year. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Structures in place include our staff responsible for administering and analyzing all above-mentioned assessments, though a 
great portion of this is conducted by our ENL teachers.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use results from the NYSESLAT, a QRI (Quality Reading Inventory) reading assessment, writing assessments created and 
implemented by our ENL instructors, regents scores, ELA and Math state assessments from middle school, ongoing informal 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

assessments conducted by our ENL instructors, PSAT score performance, and a reading inventory from our Read 180 program 
that determines students' lexile levels.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

For our incoming freshman enrolled in the Read 180 program, the ENL instructor and ELA teacher/literacy coach running the 
class will regularly update student specific data as it pertains to the reading intervention. Students will be moved in and out of 
this class as needed throughout the year. Furthermore, the afterschool program taught by our ENL teachers and math and 
science teachers is programmed and designed around such summative data.     
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Not applicable. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our ELL program is informed by results from the NYSESLAT and regents performance. Relevant data guiding the creation of an 
afterschool math and science regents ENL class includes that 17 of our ELLs failed Algebra Common Core and 13 of our ELLs 
failed Living Environment this year. Proficiency levels as per the NYSESLAT, as well as core area and ENL teacher informal 
assessments are used to guide decisions about curriculum design and strategies used within both ENL classes and our 
afterschool ELL class.      
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

These findings are disseminated via the ENL instructors during professional development meetings with the entire staff and 
team/grade wide meetings that occur during our schools lunch period at least three times a week. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Will be addressed when programming is completed. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

NA. Currently we do not have a TBE program. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

NA. Currently we do not have a DL program. 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Will be addressed when programing is completed. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

       Core content is delivered in English with native language support. Our ENL teachers collaborate with content area teachers 
to monitor ELLs' progress and to share effective ENL strategies. The strategies employed by all teachers at HSCT include: 
differentiated instruction based on approaches used to make the content more comprehensible are chunking, cooperative 
learning, and reading and writing workshops. The read aloud modeling has proved effective; as have student pairing and group 
work using the Point of Entry Model. English is used for instruction in all classes along with native language support. Student 
progress will be assessed each making period in order to evaluate and revise interventions as appropriate. Students work in 
small homogeneous groups for teachers to ensure that students grasp concepts; and in heterogeneous groups to encourage 
participation in discussions with peers in order to support their comprehension of a given topic or assignment. The ENL 
teachers and teachers across all content areas use research-based instructional strategies that include: activating prior 
knowledge; providing a print rich environment; engaging students in hands on activities; using realia, props, model activities; 
activating higher order thinking skills through sorting, categorizing, charting, mapping, diagramming; explicitly teaching 
vocabulary. Native language support is provided in all classes throughout the school day. Technology is used to enhance 
instruction and amplify content across subject areas. Our beginner ELLs travel with iPads which they use for translation and 
other linguistic purposes. 
         Our ENL teachers collaborate with content teachers across all grade levels and our grade team/discipline leaders to 
ensure that ELL students are engaged in high quality, rigorous instruction using curricula and instructional materials aligned to 
the six ELA instructional shifts of the Common Core Learning Standards. Our ENL teachers will engage ELL students in reading 
more complex texts and nonfictional sources to prepare them for the demands that both colleges and careers require.  Our 
ENL  teachers will develop the writing of their students so that it is detailed and emphasizes the use of evidence to inform or 
make an argument which is a shift from narrative writing. Our science, math, history, and technology teachers will assist ENL 
teachers in ensuring that all students including ELL’s will engage in focused instruction focused that develops the conceptual 
understanding required for them to apply their logical thinking within a context and/or a applied approach using authentic 
based performance tasks.  ELL students will build the necessary procedural skills and fluency in order to work through more 
complex problem solving leading to advance course work in mathematics.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

ELLs are assessed through the Spanish Lab as appropriate. In addition, the state-provided Regents exams are provided in 
English as well as their native language. Finally, students are given the option to respond using English or their native language 
on Regents exams as well as in some classroom-generated assessments. Whenever there is a question of a students' first-
language proficiency, our ENL teachers created native language diagnostics of the four modalities which are approved by a 
native speaker on staff (we have Spanish, Arabic, and Albanian translators, while our Bengali and French students' diagnostics 
are accounted for via Translation Interpretation Unit.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

          SIFE – Students with Interrupted Formal Education are grouped based on their skills to receive intervention during the 
school day as well as for additional instruction during our afterschool program. SIFE students are supported through the push-
in model in their content area classes. Teachers across all subject areas ensure that the four modalities, listening speaking, 
reading, writing are addressed in their lessons. They consistently utilize exemplary works, differentiated instruction, small 
group work, graphic organizers, authentic materials and technology to support the SIFEs . In addition, students are invited to 
attend after school tutoring or during their free periods during the school day to further strengthen their academic areas of 
need. We increase our social and emotional support for these ELLs through our guidance department. Our ENL and content 
area teachers also increase their communications with the parents of the identified students. Furthermore, we provide SIFE 
students with explicit instruction in basic academic skills, such as understanding the structure of textbooks and school 
materials, how to use a calculator, how to read programs, how to take notes, how to record homework assignments, etc. 
 
6b. Newcomers –  Currently students are programmed for Freestanding ESL classes, push-in services and after school and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

tutoring services to assist them in their language development and cultural awareness as this will change as per the CR Part 
154. Newcomers are provided instruction with the goal of simplifying language and amplifying content. Strategies include 
hands-on demonstrations, opportunities for role play, journal writing using native language or pictures. Students are taught 
basic vocabulary and are provided print rich materials to support their oral language development. They are also provided with 
iPads to use during their classes. Furthermore, all our newcomer ELLs are admitted into our Read 180 literacy program, 
wherein students receive targeted literacy instruction at their lexile/language proficiency levels.  
 
6c. ELLs receiving service 4-6 years – These students benefit from freestanding ENL classes, push-in services and after school 
and tutoring services to strengthen their language acquisition skills. Instruction focuses on explicit vocabulary building and 
intensive academic literacy skills building. Teachers across content areas incorporate building skills for reading and analyzing 
informational texts, as well as writing opinions and arguments in response, in their instruction. 
 
6d. Long Term ELLs (7+ years) – Our Long Term English Language Learners (LTEs) typically have near-native levels of speech 
when they come to us and are concurrently special education students. To address any language and learning deficiencies of 
our LTE population, instruction includes the following: expanding on figurative languages study, build academic language skills, 
focus on reading and analyzing non-fictional texts and writing opinions/arguments in response, and strengthen note taking 
skills working with extended literacy skills building.  Also, our ENL and Special Education instructors use differentiated 
instruction within the Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classes where Special Ed. LTEs are programmed.  Counselors and school 
support staff offer intensive social-emotional support to LTEs. Our LTE population benefits from both after school and tutoring 
services to strengthen their language acquisition.  Our  Saturday school is used as an immersion program to prepare our LTE 
population for State Regents exams. 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
SWD-ELLs are appropriately served as per each students' IEP. ENL, SpEd, NLA teachers collaborate to align curriculums with a 
focus on improving academic literacy skills. Teachers across all subject areas ensure that the four modalities: listening, 
speaking, reading, writing, are addressed in daily lessons. Teachers provide intensive vocabulary instruction on academic 
language, use of graphic organizers, and increase audio visual support to enhance access to academic content. Our ENL 
teachers and increase their communications with the parents of the SWD-ELLs. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ENL, special education, and content area teachers collaborate in weekly grade meetings to discuss and share students' 
progress in order to ensure that each SpEd ELL is afforded instruction appropriate to his/her language and learning needs. Our 
ICT classes contain 60% general education students. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The school offers a range of intervention services for ELLs which include: 
           • PD on ELL strategies for content area teachers facilitated by ENL and trained pedagogues 
           • Inquiry teams examining the progress of ELLs 
           • After school tutoring in core content areas such as math, social studies, science and technology along with NL support 
           • Integrating technology with instruction 
Targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, Math, Global Studies, Science include literacy development across the content 
areas. All teachers focus on reading and analyzing informational texts and writing arguments(claim/counterclaim) in response. 
Other literacy strategies used across the curriculum is Peer-Assisted Learning (PALS) and vocabulary word walls. Other targeted 
interventions across the curriculum include components of the workshop model in all core subject classes and after-school 
tutoring for ELLs in all subject areas. All interventions are offered in English with strong native language support. Native 
language support is offered to ELLs in all subgroups and in all content area classes such as social studies, science, math and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

computers (i.e. Bilingual glossaries, computer language programs). English is used for instruction in all classes. Scaffolding of 
instruction content area classes is a strategy employed to facilitate academic language development. To accommodate the 
needs of Limited English Proficient students in need of Special Education services, a bilingual certified Special Education 
teacher articulates with the ENL teacher in planning appropriate instruction. Each year all ELL students are administered the 
New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test (NYSESLAT) by Paul Romano, the ESL certified teacher. The 
results of this testing determine the placement of ELL students for the coming year. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Based on the data mentioned above (17 ELLs having failed Algebra and 13 ELLs having failed Living Environment) our school 
will implement an afterschool ENL regents targeted program that combines on math or science teacher with one ENL 
instructor in order to combine core content and TESOL strategies in an effort to better assist our ELLs in passing the exams. 
Additionally, we have two parent outreach meetings per year (where all content area teachers and ENL teachers of a given 
student, including that student and parent/guardian meet) will be conducted to ensure that action plans are created for 
students who have failed regents and are failing classes. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

X 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
Our ENL instructors go to great lengths to meet with leaders and coordinators of school programs (including Skills USA, the 
Bridge Program, SoBRO outreach, Robotics and Bicycle Clubs, and sports teams, and more) in order to advocate for our 
students and ensure their access to such programs. Furthermore, translators are used to inform students of these programs 
and suggest opportunities for them. Our College Adviser, who is a fluent Spanish speaker, also works in conjunction with our 
ENL instructors for recommendations about ELLs who should be included in supplementary college access courses offered at 
Lehman College, as well as an advanced literacy building program offered in the Evander Child's Campus.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
To help ELL students in all classes Promethean technology, the Quizdom hand-held survey system, visual hallway notification 
systems, bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, iPads for entering and transitioning students, and the Read 180 program are 
employed.  Students will also have access to mobile laptop carts to complete assignments, for both assessment as well as for 
instructional purposes. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is provided across all content area classes. Resources used include: bilingual glossaries, bilingual 
textbooks as available, translated texts, bilingual libraries, peer translators, bilingual audio/visual materials. Students are 
permitted to respond in their native language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All support and services are adjusted to be age and grade appropriate. Support services are aligned to appropriate age and 
grade level through grade-team meetings in order to ensure curriculum alignment and age appropriateness. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
ENL teachers at Evander Child's, as typically prompted by and organized by our school's ELL Coordinator, meet at select times 
during the year and communicate through email in order to disseminate information and share best practices. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

 

All new students to the school can attend a Summer Bridge Program. Dual language letters are sent to students' homes inviting 
them to the event. In addition, freshmen are invited to take an overnight team-building trip to Club Getaway in CT in the 
beginning of the year. Both activities are designed to aid in socialization and orientation and are supported with dual language 
letter invitations and NL support 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

As a CTE school, all ESL students are offered Spanish as a foreign language as well as the opportunity to take the NYC LOTE 
exams for their native language. Japanese classes are also offered as an alternative to Spanish. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

At this time we currently do not have a Dual Language program. 
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 Four hours each month and two full days per year of Professional Development is provided to all staff who are involved with 
ELLs and include APs, subject area teachers, special education teachers, guidance counselors, psychologists, secretaries, 
speech therapists, physical therapists, the parent coordinator, and office personnel.  A minimum of 7.5 hours of these PDs are 
devoted to ELL identification and instruction. The ENL teacher and content area teachers are encouraged to attend training 
provided by NYCDOE, BETAC, and QTEL Institutes. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Our ENL teachers will provide professional development four times a year for all staff in the following areas: Language 
Acquisition, Best practices for the Co-Teaching Model when working with students whose English Proficiency Level are either 
Entering, Emerging or Transitioning, with a focus on strategies and integrating language and content instruction for English 
Language learners. Our ENL teachers will be required to attend the same Professional development are maintained by the 
school secretary and records of attendance are maintained by the assistant principal.        
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
We conduct two parent outreach meetings per year (where all content area teachers and ENL teachers of a given student, 
including that student and parent/guardian meet) will be conducted to ensure that action plans are created for students who 
have failed regents and are failing classes. We are able to obtain Albanian, Arabic, and Spanish translators for non-English 
speaking parents. For Bengali and French speaking parents, we will typically use the Translation Interpretation Services Unit.     

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents are encouraged to participate in programs, such as parent orientation, parent meetings, School Leadership Team, 
small group workshops and to be members of the Parent’s Association. All communications are provided in English and native 
languages. Translated materials are distributed at each meeting. Topics include, but are not limited to: NYS Standards,

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Bruce Abramowitz, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Using the biography file, emergency contact cards, ATS reports (including the RCPL), Home Language 
Identification Surveys, teacher observations and notes updated in our school’s Skedula database, we evaluate our 
parents’ needs in order to ensure communication in parents’ preferred languages. These documents are accessed 
regularly to keep up with changing preferences and to determine whether to utilize an in-house staff translator 
for Spanish or Arabic or to call through the Translation and Interpretations Unit for other low incidence languages.

In the event of a school emergency our school (a) sends a letter home in English and the preferred language of 
parents/guardians as well as (b) calls the parents houses and leaves a voicemail if necessary. For low incidence 
languages our secretaries use the Translation and Interpretations Unit Service to communicate with parents.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

At both the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year in September and midway through in January, teachers and staff 
attend a professional development session where our Language Access Coordinators distribute Chancellor’s 
Regulation A-663 and show staff how to utilize the Translation and Interpretation Services Unit as well as key staff 
translators for creating translated documents within the building. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The aforementioned documents are provided to parents through the translated forms available. These documents are 
sent out at the beginning of the year by the Parent Coordinator, ENL Teacher, and ELL Coordinator. Parents sign a 
form in their home language confirming that they have reviewed the documents and are aware of how to receive 
translated services.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Parents' feedback on quality and availability of services is evaluated via parent surveys in native languages, and 
through oral interviews during scheduled meetings, phone calls made home, and mandated parent-ENL teacher 
meetings held on Saturdays with available translators.
