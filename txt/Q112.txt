Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of P.S. 112Q is to provide our children with a comprehensive education in a safe and nurturing 
environment that will enable them to become successful citizens of the 21st century. We believe that all children can 
learn. We have high expectations of all our students. We will strive to meet the needs of all students and help them 
meet high standards. High expectations and coherency are important factors in the motivation for student success—
both academically and social-emotionally. We recognize and celebrate the diversity of the P.S. 112Q community. As 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

partners, our students, parents, staff and community will work together to achieve our shared mission of making P.S. 
112Q a place of learning, and a model of educational excellence. 

As a school community, we reflect to see how shifts in our instruction, planning, communication, and interactions 
with students can push them to succeed, even with difficult tasks. We also expect every member of the school 
community to maintain professionalism, and for students, the PBIS Matrix and Behavioral Expectations. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Dutch Kills School, P.S. 112Q, is located in Long Island City, Queens, as a part of Community District 30. We have 
approximately 487 students from kindergarten through grade 5, and four PRE-K classes. The school population 
comprises 23% Black, 35% Hispanic, 8% White, and 31% Asian students. The student body includes 14% English 
Language Learners and 10% special education students. Boys account for 50% of the students enrolled and girls 
account for 50%. The average attendance rate for the school year 2017-2018 was 91%. Our diverse community 
ensures that we communicate with families in a variety of mediums and multiple languages.  

 

Rigorous Instruction always remains a top priority for our school as we want to see our students achieve at high levels 
in order to be productive members of society. We have set standards for instruction, which serve as the guidelines for 
the expectations of what should be evident across classrooms. These can be found in the Instructional Handbook, 
which is developed collaboratively by administration and lead teachers. Some initiatives we have implemented 
include: revisiting independent reading and targeted small group work, sprints for math fluency, math centers, and 
close reading protocols of complex texts. Exemplars for mathematical problem solving, and iReady assessments are 
used to determine student areas of need, as well as have them practice online testing. We will continue to implement 
programs this year that include a new second grade Spanish Dual Language program, extending from grades K and 1. 
Sanford Harmony will continue to provide social-emotional growth and self-regulation strategies for our students in 
conjunction with our PBIS school matrix. We are entering our third year with Teacher's College Reading and Writing 
Project to help our students grow academically.  

At P.S. 112Q, we have a shared commitment for all students to become agents of their own learning by understanding 
expectations, having choice, and receiving feedback to monitor their progress. Students have choice in the 
development of their ideas, materials, and strategies; experience authentic opportunities for independent 
application; and practice peer and self-assessment. The structures for student independence, choice, and feedback 
will increase engagement. 

 

In reading, students will read ‘just right’ books independently, while applying reading strategies to prepare them for 
rigorous texts. In writing, students will be able to choose their topics and support them with strong evidence through 
the progression of the writing process. Progress will be measured by utilizing running records, conference notes, 
rubrics, and adaptive assessments. 

 

In math, students will tackle multi-step problems by choosing a strategy, representing their math knowledge, and 
providing reasoning for their process. Structures for math centers and mathematical fluency are embedded across all 
classrooms. Progress will be monitored by Exemplar problems and adaptive assessments. 

 

P.S. 112Q exhibits a culture of coherent learning and feedback. With students, this is evident through their 
discussions, learning, and work products; for teachers, within their planning, practice, and professional learning. To 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

deepen our focus on instruction, we address the Collaborative Teachers aspect of the Framework by providing 
common preps for teachers to plan, grade level and ELL inquiry teams, PLCs based on teacher needs and wishes, and 
vertical Math and Literacy Teams to align instruction vertically. 

We understand that a key component to student achievement is parental involvement, which is built through Strong 
Family and Community Ties. We engage parents in a variety of ways, including workshops, programs, family events, 
and celebrations of student achievements on an ongoing basis. Some examples of our ongoing events include: The 
Daddy and Me Program, Family Night, assemblies to celebrate diversity and student achievement through our PBIS 
program, and Open House Writing Celebrations. We have partnerships with the NYU Parent Corps, City Year, NYC Kids 
Rise SAVE, and the Food Bank's CookShop Program to engage families in the development of the whole child.2 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

We have a range of students who come from many countries, and whose home language is other than English. 
Students are on a variety of levels in their commandment of both their native language, as well as English. This 
impacts our instructional methods and how we communicate with their families. To facilitate a more diverse 
community, we incorporated a Spanish Dual Language program in the beginning of the 2015-16 school year, which is 
now in its 3rd year. 

We also aim to meet the needs of our Students with Disabilities. We have Integrated Co-Teaching classes, one self 
contained class, a comprehensive SETSS program, and a variety of services to meet all of our students' needs. We also 
work to provide flexible programming, so that each child learns, within a subject area, in a classroom that best 
supports their achievement and growth, while allowing them to be in appropriate classroom settings.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our biggest gain within the Framework for Great Schools this past year was within the Rigorous Instruction element. 
In classrooms, there was an increase in engagement, with students developing ideas across content areas, and were 
able to support them with evidence and reasons. There was an increase in students' volume of writing, independent 
reading time, classroom discussion, and perseverance in solving mathematical problems. There was evidence of this in 
student work products, feedback in classroom observations, and assessment data. 

Also, within the Collaborative Teachers element, we showed we had strengthened our professional development 
plan, and saw the results within the classroom environment, in teacher planning, and in the culture of the school. We 
have a partnership with the Teacher's College Reading and Writing Project, in which staff developers worked with 
grade level teams 10 times throughout the year, and the school had an additional 25 workshops to attend at TC. The 
administrative and instructional teams were keys to fostering the development and consistent implementation of this 
work. We also participated in the district-wide Math Solutions professional development series, in which an upper 
and lower grade teacher learned new strategies to promote higher order thinking and discussion in math. Math 
Solutions provided professional development to our team of teachers: K-2 - Number Sense and Grade 3-5: Fraction. 
The AP and Peer Collaborative Teacher attended a series on Advanced Literacy, to help focus our needs in literacy 
instruction. There was consistency in turn-keying information to teachers, including allowing them time to adapt their 
instruction to push these initiatives forward. Teachers also were open to inter-classroom visitations, to see this work 
in action. Our goal is to continue this work and these practices, to continue to improve in rigorous instruction for 
increased student achievement. 

Our focus for 2018-2019 will be on strong family-community ties based on our decreased data of 3.83 (2016-2017) to 
3.59 (2017-2018).

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
According to the most recent results in the School Quality Guide, PS 112 scored a 3.63 for Rigorous Instruction. More 
specifically, the school was above the District and City averages in the following areas: Common Core Shifts in 
Literacy, Common Core Shifts in Math, and Quality of Student Discussion.  

 

To address the area of Rigorous Instruction, we have noticed a need for the development of our students’ reading 
comprehension strategies. In previous years, we have approximately 70% of students leaving the first grade reading 
on or above grade level benchmarks. Students tend to struggle as they shift from 'learning to read' and foundational 
skills to 'reading to learn' and comprehension skills. These are the necessary skills assessed on the NYS ELA Exam for 
students in grades 3-5 each spring. Below you will find the our most recent results for the Fountas and Pinnell Reading 
Level Benchmarks:

In prior years, students end up having an average of 9 minutes of independent reading time. This hinders their ability 
to build stamina, develop good reading habits, and practice reading skills at their independent level. It became a goal 
of ours to increase independent reading time to 20-35 minutes per day across grade levels. Also, teachers were not 
finding the time to pull guided reading and strategy groups that would allow them to address student needs at the 
instructional level. In order for students to be able to read rigorous texts, they must develop skills at their 
instructional level. This will then have an impact on the NYS ELA Exam scores. These data sources, as well as the 
Fountas and Pinnell levels of every student, serve as our needs assessment. Our review of the NYS ELA Exam also 
shows that our subgroup populations, including ENL, SWD, and Black students need to be addressed to improve their 
academic achievement.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, there will be an increase of at least 5% of students in Tier I as measured by the i-Ready school summary 
report. The increase in the number of students on or above level based on the i-Ready data will lead to student 
progress in school based assessments and NYS examinations, resulting in meeting Annual Yearly Progress targets.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and 
strategies your school will implement to achieve the 
identified goal for this Framework for Great Schools 
element, including: 

Target Group(s) 
Who will be 
targeted? 

Timeline 
What is the 
start and 
end date? 

Key Personnel 
Who is responsible 
for implementing 
and overseeing the 
activity/strategy? 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, 

 

professional development, and/or systems and 
structures needed to impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other 
high-need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-
credited, SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will have ongoing purposeful professional 
development focusing on literacy. This includes, but is not 
limited to: small group/guided reading instruction; the 
modeling of reading within a workshop, the writing process, 
and the use of rubrics for students to peer and self-assess. 
We will also study the progressions of reading and writing 
across grade levels. The structure of our professional 
learning will be a strategy and then work time for 
application. Our partnership with Teacher's College Reading 
and Writing Project Consultants, as well as opportunities 
outside the building, will support this work. TCRWP 
Consultants will visit the school on a monthly basis for grade 
bands K-2 and 3-5. Classroom teachers will receive two 
periods of coverage in order to attend the PD and 
implement strategies in a labsite setting. Teachers will also 
be sent out of the building to PDs at TC on a rotating basis. 

The focus of Monday professional development will be on 
small group instruction: learning progressions, looking at 
student work, creating toolkits to support small group work, 
and how read aloud supplements literacy instruction. We 
will determine how to best utilize iReady assessment data, 
reading and writing progressions, rubrics, and components 
of the Units of Study to guide small group work and strategy 
lessons. All instruction will be aligned to the curriculum and 
student needs/goals. They also have continued professional 
learning from turnkeyed sessions at TC and other areas of 
literacy during PL Mondays.  

The development of an Advanced Literacy team within the 
building (which is comprised of members from varying grade 
levels) is based on the work that began in 2017-2018. This 
will build teacher knowledge in assessment of their literacy 
components within the classroom as well as embedding the 
NGSS (Next Generation Standards) as per the Instructional 
Shifts.  

Teachers will have at least one observation in the area of 
literacy in the first rounds of observations in order to check-
in on instructional practices, as well as provide an

opportunity for feedback, questions, and concerns for 
further individual development.  

Teachers have common planning time during 3 common 
preps in which they may develop coherent instruction, align 
materials, and plan for differentiation strategies based on 
assessment data to meet their individual student needs. 

Teachers will collaborate as grade level based Professional 
Learning Communities, facilitated by the APs. Teachers will 
analyze Fountas and Pinnell data, share their 
conference/guided reading notes, and plan for guided 
reading/strategy groups by utilizing the The Continuum for 
Literacy Learning and the Teacher's College Reading and 
Writing Progressions. This resource and planning time will 
support teachers by having them plan skills and strategies 
based on where students are in order to move student 
reading levels. It will also serve as a way to monitor small 
group work, differentiation, and support continuous data 
analysis by the Instructional Cabinet.  

All teachers will be supported with guiding practices for 
inquiry and looking at student work within literacy 
instruction. All teachers will analyze Fountas and Pinnell and 
iReady data, while teachers in grades 2-5 will include an 
additional layer of analysis of the NYS ELA Assessment. The 
targeted instruction will focus the 3-5 students with the 
most needs that overlap with our priority subgroup areas. 
Teachers will meet and debrief on their instructional 
practices and reflect on effective strategies. Each team will 
have a culminating presentation to share best practices and 
new findings within the inquiry process. Endline results will 
include the impact on Fountas and Pinnell data. The APs will 
facilitate this process, with additional support from Cabinet 
Members.  

In June 2018, a list of at-risk students was generated for 
targeted instruction beginning in September of the 
upcoming school year. Flexible programming of out of 
classroom personnel will address areas of need with 
students in the area of reading comprehension with small 
group instruction as part of an RTI program. They will also 
support teachers with strategies to address ENL students 
and SWDs with professional development sessions focused 
on differentiation strategies. In addition, there will be a 
program for students who are new to the English language. 
This list is updated in between the scheduled Fountas and 
Pinnell and iReady assessments, to best monitor progress 
and next steps.  

To engage families, workshops will be conducted to help 
parents understand the Reading Benchmarks (reading 
levels), NYS Next Generation Learning Standards, Workshop 
Model, the Writing Process, NYS Assessments, and how to 
help their child at home. The outcomes of student work,

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Our school will engage families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and the Common Core 
Learning Standards by having focused parent meetings to demonstrate components of our Flow of the Day and how it 
addresses these initiatives in the classroom. Parents will be welcomed into classrooms to see student work and 
learning in action on an ongoing basis, specifically at the end of each unit of study (every 6 weeks). Results of 
assessments and feedback to students will be shared with parents, as well as the expectation criteria, such as reading 
progressions, rubrics, and the skills expected of students across their particular reading level. Communication to 
families will be ongoing, and formally at the end of each unit of study. A learning celebration will also commemorate 
the end of that unit of study. All classroom teachers will be involved, as well as our Instructional Cabinet and Parent 
Coordinator, who will host parent workshops and address parent concerns.  

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 

Part  4a.  Indicate  resources  you will  leverage  to  achieve  this  annual  goal  and  implement this  action  plan,  including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
To fully implement this action plan, we will fully utilize our resources. The APs will serve as instructional leaders by 
facilitating the professional development of teachers, as well as reviewing data and working alongside teachers 
during common preps, PLC Mondays, and Inquiry Team Tuesdays. The ENL Coordinator, and Math Coach will also 
work with teachers to develop strategic small group work lesson plans to target the specific needs of students. The 
ICT teacher will be used to develop differentiation strategies for classroom instruction. We will utilize the Fountas and 
Pinnell Reading Benchmark Assessments, as well as their resources that correlate to the reading levels. Schedule 
adjustments include: common preps, cycles for data assessment and planning on Monday's PLC time and Tuesday's 
Inquiry time, after school Literacy Team (vertical), and additional school days for teachers to attend applicable 
professional development opportunities.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In doing a comprehensive assessment of our school climate by using the PBIS Benchmarks of Quality Assessment, we 
have found that our strengths lie in the PBIS transparency of the Expectations Developed, Lesson Plans, and the 
Discipline Procedures that have been set forth in our school. This is evident through protocols and processes for 
discipline and necessary follow-through, communication of clear expectations, the implementation of a school-wide 
plan, PBIS Team, and classroom lesson plans and events that support the implementation of PBIS. In the Supportive 
Environment section of the School Survey, we had 91% positive responses in the area of Safety and 85% positive 
responses in the area of Social-Emotional.  

However, there are some areas that we feel can be improved within the Benchmarks of Quality Assessment, which 
will improve our results in areas of the School Survey and student achievement. Our areas of need include: Faculty 
Commitment, Data Entry & Analysis Plan Established, and the Implementation Plan. Within these areas, the more 
specific components that need to be further developed include: faculty feedback, faculty awareness, data systems 
(collection, analysis, sharing), orientation for new staff, students, and families, and teaching staff how to teach into 
expectations. 

We want this to have a more positive impact on classroom behavior, which was rated as 79% on the School Survey. 
We have determined that we need to develop our entire staff’s participation in creating a positive school climate, 
including buy-in for consistency. We have also found a need for the frequent sharing of data to celebrate successes 
and improvements, as well as target areas of need to create action plans. Also, we have found the need for teachers 
to respond to misbehavior as a segue to teach into social-emotional learning, all which will support their College and 
Career Readiness.  

As a result, we need more consistent implementation of PBIS, the ongoing sharing of data as a frequent check-in, as 
well as a common language for teaching character development and social-emotional health. The PBIS Team will 
analyze data for areas of celebration and growth, determines the best practices to ensure a positive school climate, 
and provides incentives for teachers who consistently participate in the PBIS systems. We will continue to utilize a 
social-emotional program to build classroom culture and provide a norm across behavioral expectations, a common 
language, and spiraling strategies that all students can incorporate into their interactions.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, we will increase fidelity towards our positive school climate by applying the PBIS methods to provide 
behavior support and interventions for individual student needs, including targeted student groups, as evidenced

by a decrease of 5% in SWIS form intake from the previous school year. The improvements in targeted areas will 
further contribute to our high expectations for learning and academic achievement.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

In September, PBIS assemblies lay the groundwork for school-
wide Behavioral Expectations for students, staff members, and 
parents. This also includes the behavioral systems, 
consequences, and rewards of the school.  

The PBIS team will meet on a monthly basis, as facilitated by the 
Guidance Counselor and Principal. The purpose of this team is to 
increase fidelity by assessing and monitoring the school wide 
practices of PBIS. These include: consistent use of “gotcha 
tickets”, class incentive charts, Think Sheets, SWIS forms, 
analysis of monthly SWIS data, PBIS week initiatives, anti-
bullying initiatives, and holding students accountable to the 
behavioral matrix. Details will be reviewed and revised as 
necessary, as well as adding additional positive incentives based 
on student voice.  

P.S. 112 has adopted the Sanford Harmony curriculum from 
grades K-5 beginning in the 2016-2017 school year. We plan to 
continue implementing it for the 2018-2019 school year. The 
Sanford Harmony curriculum is designed to teach students 
strategies to deal with social situations, including: self-
regulation, conflict resolution, communication, and 
collaboration. By facilitating the growth of positive relationships 
within the classroom, students will have better strategies to 
prevent and deal with conflict and better understand the 
differences among all children. The ultimate goal is to improve 
student cooperation, empathy and mutual respect, which in 
turn, with have a positive effect on student behavior. We will 
also implement a Quote of the Week, in which student behavior 
within that mantra will be celebrated. 

For the 2018-2019 school year, there will be a reorganization of 
the structure for PBIS support and discipline follow up. Each 
grade will have a staff member as their point person, who will 
check in 2-3 times per week, as well serve as the discipline follow 
up. All point personnel will be organized by the Guidance 
Counselor. This will result in consistency in: PBIS 
implementation, having a staff member (beyond the classroom) 
as a point for each student, disciplinary actions, and

communication with parents. Point personnel will come together 
during PBIS meetings.  

Our school has a partnership with a CBO, City Year. Their role in 
the school is to provide support to those subgroups that have a 
difficult time adjusting to their various responsibilities 
throughout the school day, as well as their interpersonal 
relationships with their peers. Subgroups may involve students 
who need individual Tier III one-to-one interventions. Members 
of City Year meet with students through social clubs and after-
school programs to help build self-esteem and teach problem 
solving skills for social-emotional growth, as well as increase 
their positive attitudes about school.  

Some of the activities that build trust through PBIS include: 
monthly assemblies that celebrate cultural diversity 
(accompanied by a poster contest), monthly open house Writing 
Celebrations for parents to appreciate student work, Chess and 
Basketball Mentoring Program, Urban Voices/Metropolitan 
Opera Guild, Activity Works, Asphalt Green, and the Microsoft 
Xbox Program. These programs expand students’ exposure and 
interest in content areas, the arts, technology, and physical 
activity. Students also gain self esteem by developing their 
interests and leadership skills.  

To further develop trust amongst parents, we will host monthly 
family nights, monthly Daddy and Me events, and additional 
parent workshops based on parent need.  

We celebrate student successes, such as: perfect/improved 
attendance, Student of the Month, PBIS Class Chart completion 
and award assemblies. The Student Government has input in 
these rewards to include student choice in maintaining a positive 
school culture. 

After analyzing attendance data, the Attendance Team will 
target students in grades 3, 4, and 5 who had more than 12% 
absences in the previous school year. When analyzing the data, 
and thinking about the students, there was a correlation 
between their attendance and their attitudes towards school. 
Therefore, in order to improve their attendance, the students 
from each grade level will be part of a mentoring group. These 
groups will meet to encourage students to take some ownership 
in their attendance, check in on their social-emotional health, 
discuss strategies to stay organized and be prepared for school, 
and feel part of a community that they want to be a part of.

This goal encompasses the plan for parental engagement for the 2018-2019 school year. Parents will be invited into 
the school to attend Cultural Assemblies, PBIS Assemblies, participate in Parent Corps. Guidance Counselor and 
Parent Coordinator will provide parental engagement workshops for families to discuss social/emotional programs 
and supports for students. 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment 
Part 4a. Indicate resources you will leverage to achieve this annual goal and implement this action plan, including 
human resources, instructional resources, schedule adjustments, etc. 
In order to reach this goal, we will utilize human resources to motivate and guide the entire school community's 
participation. This includes the PBIS Team: Guidance Counselor, School Psychologist, School Social Worker, IEP 
Coordinator, Parent Coordinator, APs, and Principal. We will utilize: the SWIS system to record and analyze data, 
Positive Behavior Matrices, the Sanford Harmony curriculum, PBIS lesson plans, and other resource to promote a 
positive school culture. Scheduling will include meeting times for the PBIS Team, mentoring sessions for targeted 
students, the scheduling of monthly assemblies and family events, both in the evening and during the school day.

In February 2019, the PBIS Team will determine the rate at which SWIS forms have been submitted on a monthly 
basis in accordance with the the PBIS Benchmarks of Quality Assessment to assess progress, as well as areas of 
celebration and need to adjust the yearly action plan as needed. The goal for the midpoint benchmark is a decrease 
of 2% of SWIS forms from the previous school year. 

 
Part 5b. Indicate the specific instrument of measure that is used to assess progress. 
The instrument of measure to determine progress is the PBIS Benchmarks of Quality Assessment and collection of 
SWIS forms. These will be compared to the collection of SWIS forms from the previous school year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the 2017-18 School Quality Snapshot, we scored 92% in the area of School Commitment and 92% in Innovation 
within the Collaborative Teachers section. On our 2014-2015 Quality Review, we were rated as Well Developed within 
4.2 on the rubric. We want to continue this success and supporting teacher collaboration. However, when observing 
classrooms, there have been trends within instruction and planning that need to be addressed. Utilizing our strong 
collaborative systems among teacher teams is a method to bridge these gaps for improved instruction and student 
achievement.  

During classroom observations, administration noticed needs for improvement in areas of instruction, including 
student discussion and use of academic language and vocabulary development, which would have a greater impact on 
student learning. Most of the low-inference observation notes indicated that although teachers were asking higher-
order questions aligned to their learning objective, students were not given the time to discuss and use a variety of 
academic and content language, while lacking some tools to engage in rich discussions. While we had a 15% increase 
in component 3b, we remained stagnant in 1e. We want to continue to strengthen the Instructional Core, in which the 
impact will be seen in the areas of Domain 1 and 3. The following percentages show teachers' Effective ratings:  

  1e Designing Coherent Instruction - 55% 
  3b Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques - 45% 
  3d Using Assessment in Instruction - 81% 
  Overall Domain 3 Instruction - 79% 

When learning more about Advanced Literacies through a District 30 initiative, the Instructional Cabinet found that 
structures and systems for vocabulary continued to be a gap in our curriculum. We will work to address this gap in 
order to improve student discussion and articulation of their ideas across content areas, and relate the development 
in this area to 1e Designing Coherent Instruction.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a decrease of at least 5% of students in Tier 3 as measured by i-Ready Needs Analysis Report. 
An increase in collaboration amongst teacher practice will lead to a decrease in the number of students below-grade 
level based on i-Ready data. This will further promote teacher learning and by extension, teacher quality. On-going turn-
key practices within vertical grades will continue to impact teacher collaboration as well best practices.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Teachers will receive actionable feedback as per the Danielson 
rubric after every observation as per coaching conversations and 
written reports. The focus of these conversations will be 
centered around promoting student discuss and use of 
vocabulary--across content areas. We will continue to stress the 
importance of aligning the components and questions of the 
lesson during planning.  

APs will conduct professional development in how to analyze low 
inference observation notes and how to plan to increase student 
discussion based on interactions in the classroom. Teachers will 
come away with planning strategies to decrease the amount of 
teacher talk, while increasing student discussion and 
engagement.  

During Initial Planning Conferences, teachers will set 2 goals, 
with at least one goal within component 3b from the Danielson 
rubric. Post-observations conferences will be utilized as the 
check-in points to reflect on strategies and assess growth, as well 
as mid-year and end-of-year conversations.  

Teachers and staff members will participate in Professional 
Learning centered around strategies to build on student 
discussion across content areas. These groups are facilitated by 
those staff members taking on a leadership role within the 
school. Outcomes from these sessions will include: common 
vocabulary protocols/instruction, vocabulary words aligned to 
units (including content and academic language), and ways to 
teach into student self-assessment for use language and 
discussion in the classroom. APs will also participate and conduct 
workshops, and delineate follow-ups and next steps for continual 
improvement. 

Teachers will have ongoing professional development focusing 
on: guided reading instruction, the modeling of reading within a 
workshop, the writing process, conferring, and small group 
instruction. This will be in conjunction with a Teacher's College 
Reading and Writing Project Consultant. All TC calendar days will 
be followed up with a turnkey session lead by the attending 
teacher. These are included in our comprehensive PD plan for 
the year.

Teachers will have at least one observation in each content area 
across the school year in order to check-in on instructional 
practices for student discussion, as well as provide an 
opportunity for feedback, questions, and concerns for further 
individual development.  

A vocabulary component has been incorporated into the Flow of 
the Day, in which teachers will put robust vocabulary instruction 
into practice. This will be supported by inquiry and professional 
learning around strategies for vocabulary instruction as part of 
our Advanced Literacy Mission. 

Teachers will be a part of grade level Professional Learning 
Communities, facilitated by the APs and supported by the

Progress will be monitored by analyzing Advance reports in December and March to check in on teacher's progress 
and areas of need within the Danielson Framework. This data will be monitored after each observation to determine 
the additional support to be provided to the teacher by support staff and additional resources.  

 

As of February 2018, the following percentages of teachers' Effective ratings:  

  1e Designing Coherent Instruction - % (+2%) 
  3b Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques - % (+5%) 
  3d Using Assessment in Instruction - % (+16%) 
  Overall Domain 3 Instruction - % (+8%) 

We have shifted our work on Monday and Tuesday time to support structures for teacher to improve planning 
practices. This has included reviewing standards, backwards design based on student work products, and pulling out 
skills and strategies from curricular calendars. This work is supporting transferable planning tactics for teachers, and 
lead by APs, the Peer Collaborative Teacher, and Math Coach.

limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. When reviewing the results of the Effective School Leadership section of the School Survey, we scored 3.91, which 
was higher than both the District and City. The areas of Inclusive Leadership and Instructional Leadership are at 91% 
or higher. We increased 8% in the area of Program Coherence from the previous year (our goal). 

2. At this time, our lowest score, at 77%, falls in the area of Teacher Influence. When considering this area and going 
back to the School Survey, 49% of teachers believed they had a great deal of influence in selecting instructional 
materials, and 74% of teachers felt they had influence in the development of instructional materials. In order to 
bridge that gap, the administration will ensure that various stakeholders are included in program decision making, as 
well as clearly understand the Instructional Focus and our actions to make it live.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be an increase of 5% in the area of Teacher Influence, as measured by results in the School 
Survey. This will result in teacher fidelity and positive impacts in student outcomes on school-based and NYS 
Assessments.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

The Instructional cabinet will analyze school data, including 
areas of success and need, to develop an instructional focus that 
encompasses our priorities for student achievement for this 
school year. The cabinet will utilize protocols to develop the 
focus, use it as a guide for all instructional decisions, and 
communicate it to the school community. 

The Math coach, ENL Coordinator and APs will serve as a 
additional supports to teacher planning and instruction, in order 
to support the follow through and consistency of new 
instructional programs, as well as the maintenance of previous 
initiatives. Teachers will meet with the aforementioned to 
continue literacy work, including deciding upon vocabulary 
instructional methods, using tools to support small group work, 
and making decisions on materials being used in the Unit of 
Study, including text, student work samples (for formative and 
summative assessments), and rubrics/checklists. There will also 
be a teacher resource room, in which teachers will have access 
to supportive materials to plan instruction.  

Each grade level will have a teacher serve as an 'expert' in the 
areas of reading, writing, and math. Within that area, the 
teacher will serve as the classroom labsite, attend targeted 
professional development, turnkey information, and serve on a 
vertical team, which will meet during Mondays Professional 
Learning time.  

Assistant principals will facilitate professional development 
sessions to build on new instructional initiatives, while 
prompting teachers for feedback in areas of success and concern 
in order to make school wide decisions.  

The Instructional Focus and Advanced Literacy Mission will be 
communicated to the school community consistently, and all 
new initiatives will be linked to is content. Vehicles to support 
this message include: SLT meetings, PTA meetings, Team 
Meetings (Literacy, Math, Instructional Cabinet), and PLCs.

In February 2019, progress will be monitored mid-year by conducting a survey that mimics the NYC School Survey for 
parents and teachers to see if they fully understand the Instructional Focus, as well as see an alignment between 
programs to reach that vision, as evidenced by an 80% positive response rate. This will provide a vehicle for feedback 
on the effectiveness and commitment to instructional programs and the coherence to our goals and focus, and guide 
revisions to our action plan.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

According to the most recent results in the School Quality Guide, PS 112 scored a 3.59 for Strong Family-Community 
Ties. The school also scored Well-Developed on the most recent Quality Review in the area of "How effectively does 
the school partner with families to support student success?" 

Parental involvement is a vital component for the success of our students; during the 2017-18 school year, we 
averaged 27 parents per workshop which illustrated a slight decrease in parental engagement compared to 2016-
2017 school year that we averaged 33 parents per workshop. The School hosted a number informative parent 
workshops with topics including: Getting Ready for Parent Teacher Conferences, Strategies to Develop Your Reader, 
Monthly family night, Pre-K Program as well as a number of student celebrations and school-wide assembly 
performances. School staff collaborated to look closely at the data from the workshops, and the teacher hosted 
weekly parent workshops aiming to promote dialogue among parents and empowers parents to understand and use 
data to advocate and support their children. By soliciting both formal and informal feedback from parents and 
teachers as well as using the School Survey Report, which reflected 87% of Parental Involvement, we determined that 
our parents are more interested in educational and Informative workshops - specifically parental skills and 
informative workshops that guide and help them understand what the learning standards and what it mean for their 
children.   

The objective or goal for the 2018-2019 school year will include a continued partnership among parents and the 
community members, to work on developing workshops, family programs as well as volunteer opportunities in our 
school and community to support parents in their efforts to become active participants in their child’s education. The 
school staff will continue designing workshops and programs to provide the school’s families with tools they to 
support their child socially, emotional and academically.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, there will be an increase of parent involvement by 5% on the Parental Involvement component of the 
School Survey, as per an increase of opportunities as facilitated by the parent coordinator and parent engagement 
team in order to support the college and career readiness of all students.

a monthly calendar in addition to regularly updating our 
school webpage, Class Dojo, and Twitter.  

  The school is hosting a monthly book club in order to 

engage parents (including the English language learners) 
and provide them with the knowledge and skills to 
ensure their children’s academic and personal growth. 

  A school District-wide health fair is an annual initiative to 
provide parents and families with health awareness and 
disease prevention educational information. 

We will continue implementing our Father’s Initiative program 
that consists of a monthly father’s workshop that allows dads to 
be more active in the academic growth of their child.  

In order to provide the service to our parents we have created a 
Parent Engagement Team. The Parent Engagement Team 
consists of the Parent Coordinator, the School Culture 
Coordinator, the ELL Coordinator, the PTA, and the SLT, as well 
several teachers and members of the school administration.  

Parents want to be informed as to what their child is learning in 
school, as well as understand the school's methodologies and 
core beliefs in educating their child. To facilitate this connection 
for parents, a series of workshops will be organized by the Parent 
Coordinator. These topics include, but will are not limited to: 
Common Core Learning Standards, Behavior Management, 
Reading Level Benchmarks, NYS Assessments, The Middle School 
Process, Successful Parent Teacher Conferences, Problem Solving 
in Math, Science Inquiry, and many others topics that parents 
express interest in. Classroom teachers will also conduct parent

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
In order to recruit teachers, we have developed partnerships with local colleges, including Hunter College and 
Columbia University, to be able to attend their talent recruitment fairs. We also host student teachers from LaGuardia 
Community College. To retain teachers, school leaders create a supportive environment, that includes clear 
expectations, distributive leadership, structures for collaboration, and opportunities for teacher voice. This is evident 
through our teams and committees, including: Literacy Team, Math Team, PBIS Team, Instructional Cabinet, MoSL 
Committee, among others. These teams also provide professional development and work toward determining the 
areas of need for professional development. The Assistant Principals also participate in professional development 
through ELI and APLI to further their instructional leadership skills.  

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
We have a variety of professional development activities that are developed through the lens of the Common Core 
Standards, our Instructional Focus and Expectations, The Danielson Framework, and curriculum. This includes looking 
at NYS Assessment data, classroom observations, teacher need assessment, teacher surveys, and other data sources 
to develop our plan. Teachers and paraprofessionals complete feedback surveys at the end of each session or cycle. 
The PD Team and Instructional Cabinet meet to make adjustments in the Professional Development calendar and 
topics.

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
In order to help assist preschool children into the elementary school program, we offer a variety of programs and 
opportunities to parents and early childhood programs. We conduct an Open House with parents of potential 
students in the spring. Once students apply, we have an P.S. 112 Orientation session, in which parents and students 
can tour the school, meet staff, and receive resources to support their child's transition. Once school begins, we have 
support staff welcome and assist students as they adjust to their new school day. We also conduct outreach efforts to 
external preschool programs, so that their students and families can be invited to these events and know what P.S. 
112 offers as well. Our school currently serves 5 pre-K classrooms within our building. We ensure that parents are 
included in the school wide events so that they become familiar with the structures, personnel, resources, and events 
that will continue to be accessible to their child as they become kindergarten students.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers are included in the use and selection of assessments to determine the best ways gather information on 
student learning within a variety of forums. The MoSL Team, which consists of representatives from both upper and 
lower grades, meet with the administration to make decisions as to the assessments that will be utilized to measure 
teacher effectiveness. The Instructional Cabinet meets to determine which assessments will provide teachers with the 
best information to target student instruction, as well as develop the Assessment Calendar and systems for progress 
monitoring. The Literacy and Math Teams, which are vertical teacher teams, meet monthly to discuss instruction, as 
well as choose assessments that reflect curriculum and analyze data to guide instruction. During grade level meetings, 
administration checks in with teacher teams to elicit feedback on assessments, including administration, data, and 
alignment to curriculum.  

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS 112, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every 
Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen 
the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is 
designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the 
education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.  

 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input.  

 

P.S. 112 will support parents and families of Title I students by:

● Our goal is to give parents the tools needed to work with their children to improve their achievement level in 
academic areas. A parent resource room, located in the Parent Coordinator’s office, will offer educational materials 
for parents. Conducting parent workshops in literacy in areas such as close reading, raising a reader, and specific 
reading skills. We will also introduce them to Fountas and Pinnell so they can have a better understanding of reading 
levels, benchmarks, and assessment. Our math coach will provide workshops for parents so that they may better 
support their children in problem solving and fluency. The technology specialist will work with the Parent Coordinator 
to assist parents in being able to utilize technology resources at home, as well as how to access student data and 
reports for progress online.  

● We will provide parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children. This includes but is not limited to: ELL services, special 
education options, variety of Response to Intervention supports, as well as after-school programs. 

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 
To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          47 

 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated

1. 

 

2. 

3. 

The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 
academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.

2. 
3. 
4. 
High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 
the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  
1. 

Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 
workshops and conferences.  

Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 
community needs.

Begin description here:            
Rationale:Current analysis of the Spring 2018 N.Y.S.E.S.L.A.T. data reveals that there is a 
subgroup of ENL students, across the grades, who consistently perform at the Entering, 
Emerging, and/or Transitioning levels in the writing and listening modalities.  The greatest 
growth in progress is evident among our early childhood ENL students, proficiency levels - 
Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning.  As a result, we will continue to target ELL students in 
Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning levels of grades  K, 1, and 2.  Our focus is to develop 
English language acquisition skills  across all four of the language modalities through small 
group instruction. The E.L.L. students will be specifically targeted using the strategies within the 
Hallmarks of Advance Literacy. The embedded skills and competencies in Advance 
Literacy will promote critical thinking, comprehension, and vocabulary needed for student 
learning. This instructional model of learning will help students to deeply comprehend, retain 
language skills, and concepts of the content being taught. 
Our Title III program will start on January 9, 2019 and will end on March 30, 2019.  The 
targeted subgroups will consist of our E.N.L. students in grades K -5.  The schedule days will be 
Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 2:45 - 4:15 p.m.  The language of instruction will be 
English.  The curriculum materials that our 3 E.S.L. certified teachers will use are the "Getting 
Ready for the N.Y.S.E..S.L.A.T." books, a variety of texts in fiction and non-fiction, and explicit 
instruction for word-learning strategies to unlock language.  The curriculum materials we plan to 
use are solely for the Title III program. 
All pertinent documents will be placed in a binder in the office of the Assistant Principal.

Rationale: It is through collaboration that teachers will work together, to analyze, to share ideas, 
and make an impact on student learning.  Professional Development for all Title III Program 
teachers will take place before and during the duration of the program.  We will conduct some 
targeted professional development during school-wide Professional development meeting on 
Mondays from 2:45 - 4:00pm.  In addition, there will be meetings held during common preps to 
prepare and assess and plan for strategies aligned to the Hallmarks in Advance Literacy that will 
meet the needs of our ENL students in the Title III program.  Professional development will be 
provided by the Assistant Principal, Math Coach, ENL Coordinator, and other staff members

Begin description here:            
Rationale: P.S. 112 respects and values the participation of parents in all facets of the educational 
process of our students. We make sure that our ELL parents and Title III  parents are well-
informed of the educational process, needs and services for their children.  Our parent 
coordinator, which is also our Language Access Coordinator, will assess the language needs of 
all our students which will enable us to reach out to a broader community of parents. In this way, 
we attempt to communicate with all constituents in their preferred languages.  Specifically, an 
evaluation of our students' families' preferred languages on our ATS Home Language report, will 
provide us with exact information needed to notify parents in their preferred language.  We have 
a few of our staff members that are fluent in Spanish, Bengali, Arabic, and Chinese.  In addition, 
all Parental Engagement Activities will be conducted in English, with interpreters for  Spanish, 
Bengali, and Arabic translations when needed.  All 65 ELL parents and Title III parents will 
receive notices about the program and Parental Engagement Activities in their preferred 
language via letter and/or email. The Parent Workshops will be conducted bi-monthly beginning 
December 2018, for one hour during both the morning and afternoon time .  The parent 
workshops will occur during the school day, after school, and in the evenings, approximately for 
one hour, to reach a wider range of parent groups.  Workshops will be conducted by the

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
It is imperative that we assess the early literacy skills of our ELLs.   P.S. 112 uses the New York City Performance Assessment 
(MoSL) for grades K - 2, and we assess reading levels through the use of the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment 
System for students in grades K - 5.  In addition, teachers use End-of-Unit assessments for content areas and we also use 
language aquistition checklists to monitor and address language specific needs of our students.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ELL students who are below grade level reading benchmarks receive targeted instruction through small-group strategy 
instruction and guided reading.  This is aligned with our school’s instructional plan in that we need to address the specific areas 
of need for individual students.  School staff is intent on developing instructional goals, methods, materials, and assessments 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

that work for each student; not a single, one-size-fits-all solution, rather flexible approaches that can be customized and 
adjusted for individual needs.   
The school uses a vertical data team as well as grade level data teams to examine and analyze current data on student 
progress.  As a result of this examination, practical "Next Steps" are planned out for the student, grade, and school. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our programs through a breakdown of our subgroups on our Progress Report.  An evaluation of our 
students' NYSESLAT scores show significant gains from year to year.  Data teams look at the subgroup of ELLs to examine 
progress in school-wide assessments.  In regards to State ELA, Math, and Science data, we have seen that the ELL subgroups 
have made the most progress out of all the subroups in the school.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

ELL students who are below grade level reading benchmarks receive targeted instruction through small-group strategy 
instruction and guided reading.  This is aligned with our school’s instructional plan in that we need to address the specific areas 
of need for individual students.  School staff is intent on developing instructional goals, methods, materials, and assessments 
that work for each student; not a single, one-size-fits-all solution, rather flexible approaches that can be customized and 
adjusted for individual needs.   
The school uses a vertical data team as well as grade level data teams to examine and analyze current data on student 
progress.  As a result of this examination, practical "Next Steps" are planned out for the student, grade, and school. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 112 uses data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention framework.   
  
To provide ELLs with rigorous, culturally responsive instruction, a strong Response to Intervention (RtI) model is in place. The 
interventions used support ELLs under the RTI structure, are designed based on research based instruction that is linguistically 
and culturally appropriate for ELLs, and use assessments to guide daily instruction (Tier1), as well as instructional routines and 
interventions in Tiers 2 and 3.  
  
RtI is an instructional model that aims at prevention and early intervention through a tiered system of instructional support—
one that adds layers of instructional support to the standard core curriculum delivered in a school, based on the demonstrated 
and changing needs of the student learners. This includes levels of intervention and instruction that increase in duration and 
intensity over time; as students improve, measured by reliable and valid assessments, the extra supports are removed.  
  
Tier 1 is the instructional core that is intended to incorporate high quality evidence-based instruction for all students. This 
includes instruction that has been shown to be effective for ELLs, and differentiation to meet students’ diverse needs. 
Instruction for ELLs in English language development is provided at the Tier 1 instructional level.  
  
Students move into Tier 2 and Tier 3 if they demonstrate a need for more targeted and intensive academic support. This extra 
support can occur in the classroom, but also in separate settings with instruction focused on specific learning targets. Tier 2 
and Tier 3 instruction is tailored to meet ELLs’ language needs and is incorporated into research-based intervention strategies. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
Data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT reveal pertinent data that tailors programming and 
delivery of instruction.    
  
Our largest proficiency level from grades K - 5 are our Advanced students.  They make up more than half of our ELL population. 
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

 

The largest group of Beginners is in our kindergarten. 
  
There are close to twice the number of ELLs in grades K - 2 as there are in grades 3 - 5. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Students in the upper grades are receiving additional support in Reading and Writing, since it is within those modalities that 
they need the most language development.  Overall, examination of data patterns enables teachers and support staff to target 
specific areas of need.  Specifically, students in grades K - 2 are receiving more targeted instruction to address Listening and 
Speaking skills while students in grades 3 - 5 are receiving more targeted instruction to address Reading and Writing. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

All our English Language Learners (ELLs) receive language instruction though Freestanding English as a New Language 
(ENL) program models. Freestanding ENL programs provide instruction in English, emphasizing English language 
acquisition.  Students in the ENL program come from many different native language backgrounds, and English is the 
common language among students.  In grades K-5  ELLs are grouped together in one class for the entire school day 
and for all content instruction.  The ENL program in the classes are implemented as 360 total ENL minutes for 
students in Entering and Emerging Levels and 180 total ENL minutes for students in Transitioning and Expanding 
Levels and 90 total ENL minutes for students in Commanding levels. These students receive instruction to develop 
English Language Skills delivered by a dually certified ENL teacher, in addition to instruction to build English language 
skills through content area curriculum. delivered by a dually certified teacher.        
 
The program models used at P.S. 112 is Heterogeneous.  Students are grouped in mixed proficiency levels. 
    

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

We currently  have Dual Language in K-2, one class per grade. The classroom teacher is ENL certified to service 
students within the classroom. In our Kindergarten classroom, the ENL coordinator services the DL classrooms. The 
ENL program in the classes are implemented as 360 total ENL minutes for students in Entering and Emerging Levels 
and 180 total ENL minutes for students in Transitioning and Expanding Levels and 90 total ENL minutes for students in 
Commanding levels. These students receive instruction to develop English Language Skills delivered by a dually 
certified ENL teacher, in addition to instruction to build English language skills through content area curriculum. 
delivered by a dually certified teacher.        

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Organization of school staff ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency 
levels in our  ENL program model.  ELLs in the ENL program  receive all instruction in English. In accordance with the individual 
student’s results of the NYSITELL and New York State English as a Second Language Achievement Test, students receive the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

mandated minutes of Stand-alone ENL instruction and Integrated ENL instruction. Entering and Emerging students receive 360 
minutes a week of the designated Stand-Alone/Intergrated ENL instruction.  Transitioning and Expanding students receive 180 
minutes a week of integrated ENL/ELA  instruction.  
  
ESL students in grades K-5 are placed in self-contained ENL classes whereby instruction is delivered by teachers who possess a 
Common Branch license as well as certification in ESL.  ELL students are provided with ENL instruction by a Push-in, fully 
certified ESL teacher. These highly qualified, dual certified teachers  along with the ELL Coordinator ensure that P.S. 112 meets 
the mandated hours of ESL services for all ELLs.  
  
In order to maximize English acquisition for ELLs, the ENL classroom teachers together with the ELL Coordinator will devote 
adequate time for collaborative planning. The teachers will have one articulation period per week with each of the classroom 
teachers to discuss individual needs of ESL students and plan lessons/curriculum together using Best Practices and Strategies 
of ELL methods.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
 Content area instruction is a critical component of language acquisition.  Research shows that language proficiencies are 
closely related to academic language.  Much of the academic language, or Tier 2 and Tier 3 words are low-frequency words 
that are found mostly in content area lessons. Students in all grade levels have bilingual dictionaries available in the 
classroom.  It is an easy reference and clarification tool. When reading texts on their own, students can look up unknown 
words and ensure their own comprehension.  The lessons for ELLs are scaffolded as individual students' language levels are 
taken into consideration.  Instruction is delivered in English with multiple means of entry points for varied language levels of 
students.  Teachers make use of visuals and increase student engagement through partner and group work.  All lessons are 
centered around the Common Core Learning Standards 
    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

English Language Learners need to be appropriately evaluated in their native language.  Students who are proficient in their 
native language oftentimes develop proficient levels of English as well. There are a few tools the school uses in order to 
determine a student’s native language proficiency.  A student whose home language is Spanish is given the Spanish LAB when 
they first enter a New York City public school.  The score of the Spanish LAB paints a clearer picture of language 
dominance.  Students who speak a home language other than Spanish are interviewed by bilingual staff members to 
determine speaking abilities.  Students who speak Bengali or Arabic, for example, are interviewed by teachers and staff who 
are proficient in those languages.  Those students’ verbal responses alongside the parent responses on the HLIS regarding 
previous schooling provide pertinent information regarding native language proficiencies. 
  
English Language Arts will be taught explicitly in our ESL classes through Word Study, Shared Reading and Writing, Reader’s & 
Writer’s Workshop, and in the Science and Social Studies content areas through carefully planned lessons using various ESL 
strategies. ESL teachers and classroom teachers will work together to scaffold the lessons to meet the language needs of our 
ESL students. P.S. 112 follows the workshop model to allow for the gradual release of responsibility within student 
learning.  This model of teaching and learning takes place during Reader's and Writer's workshop as well as within the Go Math 
lessons. 
    
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Differentiated instruction is a critical component of ELL instruction.  Students arrive at our school with diverse 
backgrounds and experiences.  It is necessary to effectively assess students’ prior knowledge in order to move forward in an 
appropriate level and manner to make language and academic progress.   
  
   a.  Students with Interrupted Formal Education are students in grade 3 or higher who are at least two grade levels behind 
their age appropriate grade.  These students need scaffolded instruction in order to help them bridge the academic gap 
between themselves and their peers. In order to best support the special needs of these students (in addition to the mandated 
360 minutes of ENL), fully certified ELL teachers will provide intensive small group intervention 3 periods a week using Imagine 
Learning English. ELL -AIS providers will support SIFE through an accelerated and explicit teaching of academic language. They 
will use the Word Study Methodologies to support them in small group settings with individualized attention to meet their 
special needs.  Title III ELL Academy After School for SIFE and Saturday Academy. During the day and in Title III After School 
programs, SIFE students receive supplemental services to target specific language and literacy needs. There will be on-going 
assessments being administered to SIFE by all service providers so that targeted educational plan can be continuously 
modified to fit the students’ special needs. The AIS team will have monthly meetings to discuss the needs of these students. 
The Parent Coordinator, as a member of the AIS team, will collaborate with the team members to reach out to parents of our 
SIFE. 
  
   b.  ELLs in US schools for less than three years (Newcomers) are still navigating their way through a new environment and 
culture.  Whenever possible, these students should be paired with school staff and resource people who know something 
about the students' languages, cultures, and school systems in the various countries of origin. An invitation to open discussions 
with the newcomer allows for focus on appropriate instructional approaches to be used with students or how to interpret 
student behaviors or customs that are unfamiliar to the teacher.  A support network for newcomer students is complete when 
all students are included and allowed to help in some way. Teachers should initially establish buddy systems in their own 
classrooms, but school-wide groups can also help. A "buddy system" pairs new students with students not new to the system. 
Where possible, newcomer ELLs will be paired with responsible students who speak their native language or with native 
English-speaking peers. These "buddy teams" go through the school day together so that the newcomers may learn school 
routines from experienced peers who have gone through the adjustment period themselves.  In this way, ELL students begin to 
learn survival English at the same time that they are getting to know other students in the school. As tutors, student buddies 
may help newcomers with academic work, especially in classes where extra teacher help is not consistently available.  In order 
to facilitate academic development, newcomer ELLs will be offered Title III After School classes. Highly qualified ESL teachers 
will provide an accelerated and explicit teaching of academic language in all content areas during after school and Saturday 
Academy. Newcomers who are on levels 1&2 will also be eligible for ENL AIS.  
              
   c.  ELLs receiving service for 4 to 6 years need additional academic support.  These 7 students require individualized 
academic interventions.   The Developing ELLs will be monitored closely by the AIS Team to ensure academic progress. 
NYSESLAT, along with other formal assessments such as the, ELA, Math, and Science will be analyzed by the team to formulate 
an appropriate educational plan for long-term ELLs. The data from these assessments will drive instruction in class, AIS group, 
and After-school. Informal assessments such as teacher observations and writing samples will also be utilized for continuous 
evaluation. A fully dual certified ELL teacher will support the long-term ELLs in the content areas.   
  
d.  We currently do not have any ELL Long-term students.    
  
e.  Our former ELLs continue to receive support services for two years after attaing English language proficiency.  Data shows 
that there is a population of Former ELLs who are identified as being part of the bottom one-third of our tested students.  As a 
result, we are providing small-group instruction for those students to target specific literacy and math skills 
    
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

  
Teachers of ELL Students with Disabilities (SWDs) need to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English 
language development.  Teachers of ELL-SWDs use grade-level Go Math, FOSS Science, and Harcourt Social Studies 
materials.  Lessons are scaffolded and differentiated to address specific needs of students.  Instruction is further driven by IEPs 
that mandate ENL instruction.  ENL is often delivered through content area instruction.  Students are given precise scaffolds to 
enrich their understanding of content while developing language acquisition skills.  ELL-SWDs whose IEP mandadtes bilingual 
instruction receive bilingual support services through contracted providers.  Daily classroom instruction is aided by a bilingual 
para.  It is imperative that ENL teachers maintain on-going dialogue and articulation with Special Education teachers. The 
students’ IEPs will be reviewed carefully by the ELL teacher,  ELL Coordinator, IEP teacher, and the Academic Intervention 
Services (AIS) team in order to best meet the educational goals stated on the IEP. Formal and informal assessments will also be 
reviewed and analyzed by the AIS team. The AIS team, along with the classroom Special Ed. teacher will identify the stumbling 
blocks of progress: disability verses challenge caused by linguistic needs. When appropriate, teachers will provide the support 
of native language as well.  Students will have accessible to them books in their native language, content-area specific bilingual 
glossaries, and electronic translators.  ENL teachers will work hand in hand with the IEP teacher to bridge resources between 
the two areas. Such teachers will attend professional development to learn best co-teaching methods. ELL-SWDs will be 
eligible for all academic intervention opportunities.    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
P.S. 112 Q The Dutch Kills School, is committed to meeting the needs of all our students, including our ELL-SWDs.  The focus for 
these students is to access curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility in order to meet needs within the least restrictive 
environment.  As a result, services are provided by fully certified teachers, both ENL and Special Education, within the 
classroom environment.  Through professional collaboration between service providers, ELL-SWDs receive the benefit of 
focused instruction that is tailored to indivual students' academic, emotional, social, and language needs.  ELL-SWDs who 
demonstrate progress and strength in a particular content area are mainstreamed into Generel Education classess for given 
periods of instruction.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeting intervention programs for ELLs is necessary to meet the specific needs of this population of students.  Upon 
examination of standardized testing data, P.S. 112 is intent on providing abundant academic supports to our ELLs in all content 
areas.  In ELA, classroom teachers and service providers are using Focus Reading and Guided Reading for ELLs.  School staff is 
closely looking at the Common Core Learning Standards, with special attention given to College and Career Readiness anchor 
standards.  With a clear framework of what our students need to be able to be part of our productive future, we are able to 
take a closer look at grade-level goals with an overarching goal in mind.  Here, we can pay close attention to Reading, Writing, 
Speaking and Listening, and Language standard.  This is done with a language specific goal imbedded within Language Arts and 
ESL lessons.  In Math, there is a separate ESL component that provides language-rich scaffolds with  math lessons as part of the 
Go Math program.  Special attention is given to content specific vocabulary and Tier II language that data reveals our students 
are lacking.  We have targeted small-group instruction for Intermediate and Advanced ELLs in grades 3 - 5 to specificially 
address language demands of the ELA.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

For the upcoming school year, supplemental services will be offered to Former ELLs.  We will have targeted instruction through 
small groups for High Achieving ELLs. Within the RtI Framework, we will have ESL certified teachers designated to support our 
struggling ELLs in need of Tier 2 and Tier 3 Interventions. 
 
We will continue to enhancing instruction through technology specifically for ELLs to develop langauge, literacy, and math. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it?

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are afforded equal access to all school programs.  Invitations for Extended Day, After School, Enrichment programs, etc., 
are distributed to all students, regardless of ELL status.  If there is a limit on the number of spaces available, students are 
selected on a first come, first served basis.  As a result, many of our ELLs are involved in Extended Day, Basketball, Chess Club, 
City Year After-School, Metropolitan Opera Guild, and Story Studio.    
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELL students need various instructional materials to reach the wide range of learners.  One of the more widely used tools is the 
Smart Board.  This interactive tool enables teachers to not only model, but allows students to have integral participation within 
the lesson.  Smart-boards are used across content area instruction.  In addition, teachers use laptops, visuals, listening centers, 
and print rich environments to enhance language learning for all subgroups.  ELL students have access to content specific 
bilingual glossaries.  They also have access to electronic translators to assist with Tier II and Tier III vocabulary.  Classrooms are 
also supplied with baskets of books written in languages other than English to support literacy skills, transferring from 
students’ NL to EL.   Our school community is committed to developing all our students literacy skills, including our 
ELLs.  Teachers are equipped with knowledge of the Common Core Learning Standards and the overarching  College and Career 
Readiness anchor standards provide a framework for driving grade appropriate lessons.  Literacy instruction is closely aligned 
with New York’s Common Core State Standards.  In math, the Go Math program differentiates within each lesson for English 
Language Learners.  The FOSS Science program allows for language scaffolds as the science inquiry process is woven 
throughout content instruction, experience, and language development.  Our Social Studies curriculum pays close attention to 
necessary grade appropriate content and also allows for rich multicultural lesson that celebrate the diversity of our school 
community.  Overall, our school community believes that we can not deliver instruction through a “cookie cutter” 
model.  Rather, specific needs of individual students are carefully examined in order to ensure access to quality education for 
all students. 
  
    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support is delivered by certified teachers and school staff who can communicate in a language other than 
English.  Instruction is delivered through the ENL model.  Students are also given training and opportunities to use bilingual 
resources to aid in their acquisition of content and language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All required services support and correspond to each of our English Language Learner’s age and grade level.  Teachers use 
developmentally appropriate materials and content to deliver instruction.  ELLs' ages and grade levels are considered as 
teachers use materials that may be of lower level, yet of high interest, depending on the grade level. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
ELL students need various instructional materials to reach the wide range of learners.  One of the more widely used tools is the 
Smart Board.  This interactive tool enables teachers to not only model, but allows students to have integral participation within 
the lesson.  Smart-boards are used across content area instruction.  In addition, teachers use laptops, visuals, listening centers, 
and print rich environments to enhance language learning for all subgroups.  ELL students have access to content specific 
bilingual glossaries.  They also have access to electronic translators to assist with Tier II and Tier III vocabulary.  Classrooms are 
also supplied with baskets of books written in languages other than English to support literacy skills, transferring from 
students’ NL to EL.   Our school community is committed to developing all our students literacy skills, including our 
ELLs.  Teachers are equipped with knowledge of the Next Generation Standards and the overarching  College and Career 
Readiness anchor standards provide a framework for driving grade appropriate lessons.  Literacy instruction is closely aligned 
with Next Generation Standards.  In math, the Go Math program differentiates within each lesson for English Language 
Learners.  The Amplify Science program allows for language scaffolds as the science inquiry process is woven throughout

necessary grade appropriate content and also allows for rich multicultural lesson that celebrate the diversity of our school 
community.  Overall, our school community believes that we can not deliver instruction through a “cookie cutter” 
model.  Rather, specific needs of individual students are carefully examined in order to ensure access to quality education for 
all students. 
    
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Before the beginning of the school year, newly enrolled ELL students are invited to a school tour.  In an effort to have 
newcomers feel more comfortable, they and their families are invited to a Newcomer Walk-Through.  Here they will visit 
different locations within the school such as the lunchroom, gymnasium, restrooms, classrooms, and offices.  Being able to 
physically navigate your way through a building is an essential component of a student’s learning. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Professional development is critical for our community of educators.  We believe it is necessary to stay in touch with the most 
up-to-date research as well as learning about best practices.  Assistant principals, common branch teachers, paraprofessionals, 
ESL teachers, guidance counselors, special education teachers, psychologists, occupational/physical therapists, speech 
therapists, secretaries, and parent coordinators all contribute to the education of the whole child.  As a result, we have a firm 
belief that we must be equipped with the current necessary tools to achieve that goal.  To achieve that goal, P.S. 112 is 
committed to attending and providing professional development for our community of educators.  School staff will attend 
related and relevant professional development sessions throughout the city.  Within our school environment, there will be a 
minimum of  5 staff development workshops provided for the whole school staff during Professional Development, grade 
conferences, bimonthly ESL Vertical Team meetings and Lunch & Learn.  Sessions will be provided by the ESL Coordinator, ESL 
teachers, Math Coach, and the Assistant Principal.

Teachers of ELLs are offered year-round professional development in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Next Generation 
Standards:  
Professional Development Topics include: 
*  Creating CCLS Aligned Reading Workshop Lessons using Ready Gen 
*  Subitizing for Mathematical Fluency 
*  Analysis of Fountas and Pinnel Reading Assessments 
*  Creating CCLS ALigned Writing Workshop Lessons using Traits Writing 
*  Creating CCLS ALigned Math Workshop Lessons using Go Math 
*  Aligning CCLS Listening, Speaking, and Language Standards with current Units of Study 
    
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Transitioning from Elementary school to Middle or Intermediate School can be challenging and intimidating, especially for 
ELLs.  As a result, we will provide workshops where both students and parents are acquainted with the options available for 
middle school.  We will have assemblies with presentations from the middle school about what they offer. 
    
It is necessary for all staff (including non-ELL teachers) to receive a minimum of 15% of the required professional development 
hours for all teachers hours of ELL training.  This will be done in the form of two sessions that will be led by the ELL 
Coordinator. There will be a sign-in sheet as well as a completion certificate after the completion of the closely monitored 7.5 
hours of ELL training.  A copy of the ELL certificate will be placed in each of the participating staff member’s file.  
  
    
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S.112 has a strong belief in parents as partners.  We believe that there must be open communication between student, 
school, and parent and a student’s success is facilitated by the combined efforts of all three parties.  As a result, we strongly 
encourage parents to be involved in their child’s education.  Starting in September with Parent Orientations, Meet the 
Teacher, and Meet the Administrators, parents are encouraged to ask questions, explore, and immerse themselves in the 
various aspects of their child’s academic development. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents needs are evaluated though open communication.  There are forums to address questions and concerns during the 
Parent Teacher Association meetings.  Further, there are parent workshops where parents provide feedback on the usefulness 
of the material covered.  The most beneficial tool are the parent surveys that allow for anonymity and honesty.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dov Witkes, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

P.S. 112 both respects and values the involvement of parents in all facets of the educational process. We 
therefore make sure that our parents are well informed of the educational needs and services for their children. 
All parents or guardians of newly enrolled students are required to complete a Home Language Identification 
Survey (HLIS) during registration. In Part 3, the Parent Information section of the survey, there are two questions 
that specifically ask parents about their preferred language for written information as well as oral communication. 
An evaluation of these responses enable us to reach out to a broader community of parents by making an attempt 
to communicate with them in their preferred language. Specifically, an evaluation of our student's families' 
preferred languages revealed that Spanish and Bengali were most common. As a result, written notices are 
translated into Spanish and Bengali. Further more, we gather information about language preferences during our 
ELL Orientation Meeting when parents complete the Parent survey & Selection Form. We utilize the Department 
of Education Translation Unit and in-house school staff to have documents translated in the preferred languages 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

so our parents are able to read and understand the information being sent home. In addition, we make an 
attempt to provide interpretation services for parents who need assistance communicating with school staff. We 
have designated interpreters who are fluent in Spanish, Bengali, Arabic, Cantonese, and Chinese.  

We want all our parents to be provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in our school community and 
have access to programs and services critical to their child's education. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

interpretation service(s)?  

P.S. 112Q is well equipped to provide 
interpretation services during a face-
to-face meeting with parents. We 
have staff members and an array of 
parents that are proficient in the 
preferred languages.  

Parents are notified by letter in their 
preferred language. Teachers, 
administration, and parents work 
together to set-up translators on each 
floor in the preferred languages. 

Teachers set-up meetings with 
parents by letter, email, or phone call. 
Communication is conducted in the 
preferred language with the help of 
other staff members as needed. 

Letters and/or flyers are created on 
month in advance, allowing sufficient 
amount of time for translation via 
email.  

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of

In compliance with Section VII of Chancellor's Regulations A-663, P.S. 112Q will  

* Provide each parent whose primary language is a language other than English with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights 
and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. They will receive this 
information in their home language where available. 

* Post a sign indicating the availability of interpretation services in each of the covered languages in a conspicuous 
location near the main entrance. 

* Include in the school's safety plan procedures for ensuring that parents in need of language access services are not 
prevented from reaching the school's administrative offices solely due to language barriers. 

* Ensure that if there are parents of more than 10% of children who speak a primary language that is neither English 
nor a covered language, we shall obtain from the Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation into such language 
of the signage and forms required pursuant to this section and shall post and provide such forms in accordance with 
this section. 

* Inform parents of the Department's website that provides information in each of the covered languages concerning 
the rights of parents to translation and interpretation services and how to access such services 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Ensuring the quality of our language services is critical to communicating effectively with our parents. Therefore, all 
teachers, staff members, and parent volunteers work in collaboration to rollout the evaluation mechanisms to ensure 
the successful implementation of the language access initiatives made possible by the Translation & Interpretation 
Unit. The following surveys are used to gather feedback from parents … 

• Principal Satisfaction Survey – Survey distributed to all school principals to assess the central supports provided to 
schools, including the provision of language services by the T & I Unit and external language service providers.

• T & I Customer Satisfaction Survey – Survey distributed to all T & I customers to assess provision of language 
services by the T & I Unit. 

• School Survey for Parents – Survey made available to all school-aged parents to assess their child’s school, including 
whether or not the school is communicating with the parent in their native language. 

• Monitoring of Multilingual Welcome Poster – Constant monitoring of parents' usage of the multilingual welcome 
poster visibly posted at the entrance of the facility to gain access of information.  

In addition, the Parent Coordinator maintains records of all service requests received for written translation services, 
on-site interpretation services, and over-the-phone interpretation services from all parents.
