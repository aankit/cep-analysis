Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

The Manhattan Beach school strives to achieve the following mission: In partnership with our school and the home, all 
students will learn to become better thinkers. Our goal is to help them to be responsible, productive, caring members 
of our culturally diverse community as they acquire a lifelong love for learning.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The interdisciplinary curriculum, built around the New York State Social Studies Standards, allows students to extend 
and apply knowledge as they make real-life connections. The school actively works to contribute to the development 
of the whole child through student government, the Hero Program , and the Ambassador program. These programs 
support students as they develop the social skills, leadership skills, and empathy needed to make significant 
contributions to the school community. 

 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

English Language Learners comprise approximately 11% of our school population, with the largest number of ELLs in 
kindergarten and first grade. These students require additional support as they develop not only the social language 
skills needed to engage in our school community, but also the academic vocabulary needed to master their grade-
level content. Students with Special Needs comprise approximately 8% of our school population. The majority of 
these students receive additional support in achieving the ELA and math standards through a combination of push-in 
and pull-out SETSS. We have two self-contained bridge classes; one class services kindergarten through second grade 
and the other services students in grades three to five.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Over the past year, our school made progress in several elements of the Framework for Great Schools. In order to 
continually improve our Supportive Environment, we expanded our existing opportunities for school service to 
include the P.S. 195 Green Team. Students were able to develop leadership and problem-solving skills as they 
engaged in a variety of projects in order to help our school improve our sustainability. Last year our teachers focused 
on building a growth mindset in students. This year, our STEM initiatives allowed students to put this mindset to good 
use. They actively engaged in challenging tasks which often pushed them to take intellectual risks. Through a variety 
of engineering activities, they learned that failure is a critical part of the design process. Those who were able to learn 
from failure, revise plans, and try again were rewarded with success. As a school community, we believe that these 
experiences help students build the habits of mind necessary to persevere through challenges. They are taught that 
with time and effort everyone can achieve at high levels. This has made a substantial impact on their perspective as 
learners. Students share their thinking, develop self-confidence and increase their motivation to persevere through 
challenging content.  

We made tremendous progress in Rigorous Instruction this year. At the conclusion of the 2016-2017 school year, the 
majority of staff members indicated a desire to improve their professional knowledge in the area of guided reading. 
As a result, we dedicated a tremendous amount of time and resources throughout the 2017-2018 school year to 
developing and maintaining a consistent approach to small-group, student-driven literacy instruction. An expert in the 
field of literacy worked with our staff to understand how to plan effective guided reading lessons; select and 
introduce texts; use student reading behaviors to develop teaching points; and provide ample opportunities for 
students to engage in discussions around text. As a result of these efforts, teachers worked together to support one 
another in the implementation of guided reading. They participated in intervisitations with their colleagues to observe 
one another and provide feedback. They collaboratively planned and reflected on the success of their lessons. A 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

review of formal and informal observations of guided reading lessons revealed a significant improvement in the 
quality of instruction in meeting the needs of individuals and groups of learners.  

We are also proud of our continued collaboration with parents and the Parent Association in support of improved 
outcomes for our students. This year we hosted many exciting events which provided parents with the opportunity to 
engage in fun activities along side their children. Breakfast with Dad, parent/child dances, art exhibitions, dance 
performances and the science expo are a few examples of these exciting events. Additionally, we had a number of 
opportunities for parents to visit their children's classes for celebrations of learning. As a result of these efforts, our 
overall score in the area of Outreach to Parents increased by 1.4 points on the 2017-2018 school year.  

During school year 2018-2019, we will, we will focus on excellence in the elements of Collaborative Teachers and 
Instructional Leadership. We have a strong instructional foundation upon which to build. The upcoming year will focus 
on making expectations for meeting instructional goals clear to staff and the utilization of teacher teams as the 
vehicle by which we will improve the use of formative assessments to tailor instruction to better understand the 
needs of all learners. Administration will play an important role in the work of teacher teams during the professional 
development cycle. This will help teachers feel supported as they analyze student work and plan instructional next 
steps.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. On the most recent NYC School Survey (2017-2018), 100% of teachers indicated that they teach critical thinking 
skills to students. They also indicated that 95% of teachers talk with one another about instruction and design 
instructional programs together. 

2. During summative conferences, 50% of teachers indicated that they would like more support in expanding their 
knowledge of instructional techniques for engaging students in high-level thinking and discussions. Additionally, the 
2017-2018 NYC School Survey indicated that only 63% of students respond to challenging questions in class. Analysis 
of Advance data reveals that the average end-of-year rating for Danielson component 3b (Questioning and 
Discussion) is 2.98/4. Therefore, this will be a prioritized need for the 2018-2019 school year.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
Rigorous Instruction: 

By June 2019, 25% of teachers will improve their questioning and discussion techniques as evidenced by an increase 
0.25 increase in the average MOTP rating for Danielson component 3b.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. Teacher responses on the NYC School Survey indicate that 84% of teachers say that their professional 
development experiences this year have included enough time to think carefully about, try, and evaluate new 
ideas. 95% of teachers indicated that the principal has high expectations for student achievement. 95% of 
teachers say that the principal encourages feedback through regular meetings with parent and teacher 
leaders. 

 

2. Teacher responses on the 2017-2018 NYC School Survey indicated that 32% of teachers require clearer 
expectations for meeting instructional goals. Only 58% of teachers indicated that the principal participates in 
instructional planning with teams of teachers. Only 58% of teachers felt that they had influence over the 
development of instructional materials. Therefore, we will prioritize a systematic approach for administrative 
support in professional learning, instructional planning, and assessment of student work. This will take place 
during weeks two and three of the professional learning cycle and half-days dedicated to instructional 
planning. 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, administrators will support the instructional growth of teachers by engaging in collaborative planning 
with 100% of grade level teams each professional learning cycle as evidenced by refinements to instructional units, 
tasks, and rubrics.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          32 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. P.S 195 Manhattan Beach, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A 
of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community.

Rationale: The goal of our ENL After-School Program is to provide our ELLs&nbsp;with 

Begin description here:            
· 
additional English Language Instruction through a variety of fun activities. The program will 
help ELLs&nbsp;improve his/her English skills across all areas: vocabulary development and 
speaking, listening, reading, and writing. We will incorporate&nbsp;language learning activities 
in the gym, where children can learn new words and use them in sentences in a fun and 
interactive way, through play. Our ELLs enjoyed these classes&nbsp;this year and we intend on 
continuing this very effective practice next year. 
· 
Based on trends from prior years, we project that we will serve 15-20 kindergarten students, 8-10 
first grade students, 5-10 second grade students, and 5-10 students in grades 3-5.  Students will 
be grouped based on reading level, language proficiency level and areas of need of improvement. 
The ENL teacher provides instruction to students in each group as follows: Group 1 
(kindergarten and first grade) on Wednesdays for 45 minutes, Group 2 (kindergarten and first 
grade) on Wednesdays for 45 minutes, Group 3 (first and second grade) on Thursdays for 45 
minutes; and Group 4 (third-fifth grade) on Thursdays for 45 minutes. Three groups in the Title 
III Program for English Language Learners will address the needs of students in kindergarten 
through second grade who are at the beginner, intermediate and advanced levels (Entering, 
Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding) of English language proficiency as per their 
NYSITELL and/or NYSESLAT scores. For these students, the Title III Program focuses on 
increasing their oral language skills and literacy skills, with a focus on foundational skills 
(phonics, grammar) and building academic language through direct instruction in ELA utilizing 
various materials. 
· 
Children will attend this optional after school program for 10 weeks, for  1.5 hours per session, 
twice weekly Wednesdays and Thursdays), for a total of 20 sessions.  The start date is 
November  2017 and the program will run until January 2018. An administrator will supervise 
the program, paid per session from Title III funds for the portion of the program occurring after 
the end of the other after-school program taking place at the school (2:30 - 4:15). The remaining 
cost for supervisor per session will be paid from other school funds.  The ENL teacher and 4 
classroom teachers will be paid per session from Title III funds.  The total allocation for per 
session funds for the after school program is $7,419.  
· 
teacher is also fluent in Russian, the language spoken by the majority of our ELLs. She will 
provide native language support to the students as needed. &nbsp; 
· 
There is one certified ENL teacher co-teaching with four content teachers (certified Early 
Childhood and Common Branch) in order to help students acquire English academic language 
through content using ENL best practices.  The ENL teacher is responsible for coordinating the 
program, co-teaching with ELA content teachers in order to implement ENL best practices, and 
providing ELA content teachers with professional development that will support them in 
utilizing instructional strategies that help ELLs to build academic vocabulary.  The ENL teacher 
will order and distribute materials, write and send letters home and maintain all record-keeping

The "LitCamp" program from Scholastic, is designed to address speaking and listening, reading 
fluency, reading comprehension, and  writing.  The program also provides opportunities for 
community-building exercises in which students participate in discussions and games designed 
to enhance communication skills and build a sense of belonging.  The lessons address the social-
emotional needs of the students through a focus on  developing key strengths (hope, kindness, 
belonging, courage, curiosity, friendship, and confidence) to help students meet the challenges 
they face in their educational lives and communities.  The LitCamp program contains specific 
modifications to meet the needs of English language learners. 
 For lower grades the school will utilize “Trait Crait Plus” program by Ruth Culham. This 
program develops students’ writing skills with emphasis on different modes of writing: narrative, 
informational, and opinion. It contains a variety of materials and access to online resources to 
help enhance reading/writing instruction in the classroom. To develop and strengthen students’ 
academic language in upper grades, we will use  “Academic Vocabulary Toolkit” by Kate 
Kinsella. Additionally, we will continue purchasing and distributing "The Oxford New Russian 
Dictionary" and Russian-English Bilingual dictionaries to our content area teachers to help them 
enhance their instruction with the use of the students' native language supports. "New York 
ELLs" preparation materials for NYSESLAT from "Finishline" were purchased this year for 
grades K-5 in order to help students become more familiar with the test, expose them to the test 
formality, and to apply language strategies that were taught in stand-alone as well as integrated 
ENL periods. We find this practice very effective and intend on purchasing these preparation 
materials next year as well. To further ensure that the needs of these ELLs are being 
met technology will be implemented as a resource for instruction will be implemented.  Students 
can engage in individualized instruction to meet their specific needs.  Newcomers utilize a 
computer-based program that provides them with instruction in letter-sound 
correspondence.  Emerging and transitioning students utilize a computer-based reading program 
that is self-paced. It allows students to build upon their knowledge of letter-sound 
correspondence to begin to read words, sentences, and eventually stories. 
During whole class instruction, SMART-boards are utilized to provide students with visual 
references to support their comprehension, complete grammar-related activities, and expand 
academic and social vocabularies.  Our teachers will use the materials described above, in 
combination with guided reading, to improve ELLs' listening, speaking, reading, and writing 
skills. $2,473 of the Title III budget is dedicated to purchasing these  materials with 
the remaining cost to be paid from the other school funds. Also, this year our school  purchased 
new desks and chairs for our ESL classroom from other than Title III school funds. However, the 
number of ELLs in our Stand-Alone ENL classroom increased which is why we need to buy 
additional desks and chairs for the upcoming year.

Part C: Professional Development  
The Title III Professional Development Series will be attended by those teachers who will teach 
in the Title III After School Program. The licensed ENL teacher will conduct a full day of 
professional development for the Title III staff during November 2018. One-third of the day will 
be dedicated to providing the common branch and early childhood teachers with specific 
strategies for supporting language acquisition and information about assessing English language 
learners.  One-third of the time will be spent identifying the strengths and areas in need of 
support for each group of students.  The ENL teacher will support the classroom teachers in 
interpreting data about the students they will serve.  The remaining third of the day will focus on 
familiarizing Title III staff with the materials/programs.  Based on what they learned about the 
students they will serve, teachers will plan specific instructional supports to meet the needs of the 
learners in their groups.  Our teachers will spend a portion of the time dedicated to professional 
development to engage in collaborative planning with the certified ENL teacher who will serve 
as a resource to the teachers, providing input about appropriate ENL methodologies. They will 
review the program materials and the most recent data for each of their students. Based on this 
information, they will decide when additional modifications/materials are needed to best meet 
the needs of their students.   This early intervention will help to minimize the number of At-Risk 
and Special Education ELLs in the future.   
  
Additionally, the ENL teacher will attend professional development (PD) opportunities and share 
the information with the rest of the teachers in the school.  General education teachers also have 
the opportunity to attend PDs offered by the Department of English Language Learners and 
Student Support.  Teachers who attend PDs will turnkey the information pertaining to ELL 
instruction to their colleagues throughout the year. For instance,  this year our classroom teachers 
attended PDs such as "ELLs and Technology", and "Reading with fluency." Our ENL teachers 
collaborated with the content area teachers delivering PDs on an on-going basis throughout the 
2017-2018 school year. Some of the topics covered  included the "SIOP" method as well as 
"Writing language objectives," and "Thinking routines."  Next year our teachers will 
continue  attending conferences and learning opportunities, sharing, and implementing best ENL 
practices. The topics to be covered will include "Teaching grammar through content," "Teaching 
Academic Vocabulary to strengthen students' writing," and other topics depending on the needs 
of our ELLS upon analyzing the 2018 NYSESLAT data.

Research has shown that when parents are active participants in their children’s academic lives, 
the achievement of English Language Learners improves. Based on the feedback received from 
parent surveys and our past experience with offering parent workshops, we have decided to offer 
parent workshops focused on ELA and language acquisition and mathematics.  The ENL teacher 
will organize a literacy event for parents and students, in which books and resources are given to 
the parents and explanations for home use are provided. We would also like to show parents how 
to use "Myon" and "Reading A to Z" at home in order to increase fluency and

comprehension. The ENL teacher will engage parents in supporting their child's literacy 
development through activities which demonstrate successful reading strategies.  These 
workshops will take place after school beginning in February.  One workshop will focus on 
grades K & 1, one workshop will focus on grades 2 & 3, and one workshop will focus on grades 
4 & 5.  Each workshop will be one hour in length.  Parents of ELLs and former ELLs will be 
invited to participate.  Per session funding will be utilized to pay the ENL teacher to facilitate the 
workshop.  The ENL teacher is fluent in Russian, the home language of the vast majority of our 
ELLs.  Therefore, translation services may not be needed for all of the workshops.  If parents are 
in need of a different language, we will utilize funding to ensure we have a translator.  A similar 
series of workshops will be planned to address the content area of mathematics.  We will host 
three workshops geared toward the grade bands described above.  Per session funding will be 
utilized in order to pay the ENL teacher and a teacher familiar with mathematics content across 
all grade levels to facilitate the workshops during the month of March.  Based on parent 
responses, additional funding may be used for translators for languages other than Russian.  $825 
will be utilized for teacher per session, supervisor per session, and translators.  The remaining 
$411 will be utilized to purchase books that students will take home following the literacy event.  
This year we invited parents in for a NYSESLAT informational session, in which we explained 
the testing process and gave out sample questions for parents to view and become familiar with 
all grade level bands. We are planning on organizing this session again next year. Our of our 
ENL teachers, who is also fluent in Russian, will provide native language support to Russian 
speaking parents. Parents will receive notices in their native language and every effort will be 
made to have translators available at all workshops.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
There are several assessment tools used at the school to assess the early literacy skills of the students. The NYSITELL for 
newcomers and the NYSESLAT are the first exams to measure the English language proficiency level of the child. MOSL 
(Measures of Student Learning) and Fountas and Pinnell are also used to assess the early, as well as, advanced literacy skills of 
our ELLs.  Teacher made exams align with curriculum and predictive exams are aligned with and mirror the state ELA 
exam.  SuperKids phonics program is also used to assess literacy skills of our Kindergarten ELLs.  Data reports and assessment 
reports, provided by Fountas and Pinnell, are generated by class four times a year.  Item skill analysis reports for class and 
individual students are also available. ELA results are analyzed in grades 3-5 to help guide instruction that identifies CCLS skills 
that are in need of further support. Student success is evaluated by analyzing running records, observing student achievement

and student progress.  TCRWP and running record results will guide teachers to group for instruction. The ELL Data Analysis 
Tool (EDAT) is another great resource, that is used to create  a report  that contains quantitative data, such as  the ELLs'  state 
exam scores, including the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT broken down by the four language modalities, and helps us guide our 
ENL instruction. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The school staff is devoted to our ELLs' success through providing teachers with varied structures to support them in their 
instructional planning and lesson delivery for ELLs. In addition to ongoing professional development meetings, general 
education teachers meet twice a week, on Mondays and Tuesdays, with our ENL teachers for Integrated ENL co-planning 
sessions. During this time they collaborate to improve our ELLs' language skills across all four modalities, with emphasis on 
academic language development and successful implementation of integrated ENL services utilizing varied co-teaching models. 
Specifically, teachers analyze assessment data, students' most recent work samples, and discuss content and language 
demands of the upcoming lessons to tailor their instructional approaches to meet individualized needs of our ELLs and ensure 
the content is accessible to them. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the ENL Program is evaluated based on the upward movement within proficiency levels and modalities on the 
NYSESLAT. We incorporate varied forms of assessment to monitor ELLs' progress, including the annual NYSITELL and NYSESLAT, 
"Student Oral Language Observation Matrix," writing assignments, running records, and teacher observations. The AMAO Tool 
can be used to evaluate the success of our ENL program for ELLs once the NYSESLAT scores are available to us. Fountas and 
Pinnell grade level assessments are ongoing to ensure progress is being made by ELLs. These assessments help our teachers 
gather data to differentiate their instructional strategies according to the students' needs, their learning styles, and ensure the 
students' engagement regardless the level of their English language proficiency. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Differentiated instruction helps not only address the needs of our ELLs but also keeps the number  of interventions  at a 
minimum. Our school primarily uses Tier 1 supports with the first line of defense taking place within the classroom. 
Additionally, we have Tier 2 intervention for small groups, with 3-5 students  in each. ELLs who need extra support in 
developing their reading skills participate in the reading recovery program for 30 minutes daily within a small group outside 
classroom instruction. This program with its individualized approach to each student helps them quickly improve their reading 
skills and increase their vocabulary. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our school uses data to guide instruction for ELLs with the RTI framework.  We have universal screening using the Fountas and 
Pinnell Assessments to ensure students are on grade level and to identify areas that need improvement to get to grade 
level.  In Tier I, instruction is differentiated for students based on their language proficiency (data from the NYSITELL and 
NYSESLAT) and ability.  The ENL teacher collaborates with the classroom teachers regarding ELL academic and overall 
success.  There is strong core instruction that is delivered to ELLs and the entire class, taught by the classroom teacher and the 
ENL teacher.  Language and literacy through reading, writing, listening and speaking is taught across the curriculum.  The ENL 
teacher and classroom teacher use students' background knowledge to make lessons meaningful.  Teachers teach complex 
thinking while providing students with instructional supports to achieve success. Teachers teach through conversation, 
building students' abilities to form, express, and exchange ideas through dialogue, questioning and sharing ideas and 
knowledge.  Teachers carefully listen, make inferences about intended meaning and adjusts responses to assist students' 
efforts.  There is intensive, tailored instruction for ELLs when the ENL teacher is teaching intergrated and stand alone ENL. 
Native language support is provided by one of our ENL teachers, who speaks Russian, the language spoken by the majority of 
our ELLs.  Students work in pairs and are able to communicate in their native language.  Translation is used whenever possible 
(with another student or teacher who speaks the native language and by using Smart Board technology).  We have on going 
progress monitoring to ensure students are making progress.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          46 

 

 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
During the month of May, each ELL is administered the NYSESLAT to determine their English language proficiency. Based on 
the students' performance on the 2017 NYSESLAT, the proficiency level of the total number of students is as follows:  1 is 
Entering, 3 are Emerging,  6 are Transitioning , and 42 are Expanding. On the 2016-17 NYSESLAT, 15 ELLs reached the 
Commanding level of English language proficiency. More specifically, the 2016 NYSESLAT reveals the following:   
-In 1st Grade, 1 is Entering, 0 Emerging, 0 Transitioning, 12 Expanding and 11 Commanding. 2 children have IEPs. 
-In 2nd Grade, there is 1 entering, 2 Emerging,  4 Transitioning,  16 Expanding, 2 Commanding, 5 children have an IEP. 
-In 3rd Grade, there are 1 Transitioning, 7  Expanding and 2 Commanding. No student scored at the Entering or Emerging  on 
the NYSESLAT, 2 children have an IEP.  
-In 4th Grade, there is 1 Transitioning. 
-In 5th Grade, there is 1 Entering, 3 Expanding and 1 Commanding, 1 child has an IEP.  
  
Data patterns across proficiency levels on the NYSITELL are as follows: 
-In Kindergarten, there are 4 Entering and 5 Emerging. 4 out of 4 students who scored Entering received a 0 in the speaking 
modality and a low to medial score in the Listening modality. The other 5 students received showed a pattern that all of the 
students need more support in speaking. Their listening scores were also low, but were a little stronger than their speaking 
skills. 
  -There are 8 Transitioning who also show a pattern in having a low speaking score, as well as scoring medial to low in the 
listening section 
  -There are 8 Expanding, who also show a pattern in having a lower speaking score, as well as scoring a medial to high score in 
the listening section 
  
-In 2nd Grade, there is 1 Entering, she was unable to answer any in the speaking and writing  components. questions. 
  
    
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, instruction is tailored to meet the individual needs of each student. In our 
school we use “Gradual release of responsibilities” approach: “I do”- “We do”- “You do.” At the “I do” level this approach 
involves explicit teacher modeling and think-aloud strategies. At the “We do” level, we use assessment data to form 
groupings  which help not only differentiate instruction to meet various academic, language and social needs, but also help 
students practice new skills with their partners before they move do perform a task on their own. Finally, at the “You do” level, 
students are ready to work independently. This approach helps our ELLs lower their anxiety and feel successful completing 
tasks. "The Bilingual Common Core Progressions" is another great resource that we use in our school to help us differentiate 
instruction and assessment for all ELP levels based on linguistic, content, and grade demands. These practices along with 
multiple collaborative opportunities result in creating rigorous instruction that is accessible to all students.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).

school population. The students are heterogeneously mixed in their classes and instruction is provided by two fully 
certified ENL instructors, one of whom speaks the native language of the majority of the students. 
 The program for the 2017-2018 school year consists of 84 ELLs.  There are 27 children in kindergarten who receive 
ENL services and almost all of them speak Russian. There are 15 children serviced in grade 1 and they speak Russian 
with one student who speaks Hungarian and one who speaks Turkish. There are 10 FELLs in 1st Grade. There are 23 
students in grade 2. There are 9 FELLs in 2nd Grade. There are 3 ELLs (1 who speaks Mondalvian, 2 who speak 
Ukrainian and the rest of the ELLs speak Russian) There are 11 ELLs in  3rd Grade and  4 FELLs. There is one FELL who 
speaks Polish. There are 3 ELLs and 3 FELLs in 4th grade (one who speaks Uzbek) and 5 ELLs and 1 FELL in 5th grade, all 
of whom speak Russian.  There are no SIFE students.  Approximately 23% of the ELL students are at the Entering and 
Emerging levels of English language proficiency leaving the remaining  at the Expanding and Transitioning level of 
language proficiency. Our ENL program requires to be aligned with mandated ENL, ELA and content area learning 
standards and the core curriculum.Stand alone ENL instruction focuses on explicit academic vocabulary instruction 
within ELA and Social Studies Curriculum and implicit grammar instruction that is embedded in the content being 
taught. All four language modalities are incorporated within each lesson.   Teachers are fully licensed and professional 
development is on-going. Our school follows the CR-Part-154-2 (K-8) English as a New Language Units of Study and 
Staffing Requirements.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            All services are given by two K-12 Certified TESOL teachers. Teachers work together to create a schedule that 
accommodates the needs of ELLs as well as SWDs. The ELL Data Update Report  (EDUR) from  the Division of ELL and Student 
Support provides critical data points that allow us to make important decisions regarding ENL programming and services and 
helps ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to the students' ELP levels.   
It is understood that: 
Students with an Entering Language proficiency level will have 360 minutes a week of instructional ENL time.  That 
instructional time will be separated by 180 minutes on Stand-Alone ENL instruction and 180 minutes of integrated ENL study in 
ENL/ELA. Students who are at an Emerging language proficiency level will receive 360 minutes a week of instructional ENL. 
Their instructional time will be 90 minutes of study of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of integrated minutes of study in 
ENL/ELA. Students who are at a Transitioning language proficiency level will receive 180 minutes a week of instructional ENL. 
Their instructional time will be 90 minutes of study of Stand-Alone ENL(or integrated) and 90 minutes of integrated minutes of 
study in ENL/ELA. Students who are at an Expanding language proficiency level will receive 180 minutes a week of instructional 
ENL. Their instructional time will be 180 minutes of integrated minutes of study in ENL/ELA or other content area.  All Former 
ELLs will continue to receive services for an additional two years of 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL in ELA or content area 
subjects.  
 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Content area instruction is all in English in the classrooms with native language support.  Classrooms have libraries with 
Russian books, English to Russian dictionaries and glossaries to help support students during content area instruction.  The 
students who speak other languages are supported through peer translation during accountable “turn and talk” time and 
whenever needed. Smart board, Google translation technology are also extra support in native language support.  The ENL 
program focuses on reading, writing, listening and speaking in English with content area subjects integrated as well.  If an ELL is 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

having specific trouble with a topic, the ENL teacher is available to help.  Teachers instruct using ENL strategies such as 
differentiated instruction, scaffolding for all students, TPR (Total Physical Response) for newcomers, using visuals, graphic 
organizers and some teachers have Smart Boards in their classroom to help with translation when needed through Google 
translation and using visuals for support.  Teachers are explicit in their instruction to help all students.  They don’t assume their 
students know the material, instead they are always questioning and assessing to make sure the content is comprehensible 
and the ELLs are developing their English language skills. Language development is a part of every lesson with the 
classroom/cluster/ and ENL teachers.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Students, who are entitled to ENL services and are dominate in their native language, are evaluated in their native 
language.  For instance, when these children take the Math State test, a glossary and/or test is given to them in their native 
language and/or a translator is hired to translate the test for them. Additionally, one of our ENL teachers provides Russian 
translation when necessary. Communication between the parent, teacher and ENL teacher is conducted to determine which 
language is dominant for assessing the child.     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction is differentiated based on the students’ individual needs and the data from the RLAT. There are several assessment 
tools used at the school to assess the early literacy skills of the students. The NYSITELL is used for newcomers and 
the NYSESLAT scores are first examined to see their English language proficiency level and analyze their progress. A review of 
the NYSITELL kindergarten scores indicates that they need to develop their speaking skills. A review of the NYSESLAT scores in 
upper grades indicates that most students scored low on the writing modality. These students' needs will be addressed and 
additional instruction will be provided in order to help them develop these language skills.  
 Informal classroom assessments are administered to kindergarten children as well as the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark 
Reading assessment,  TCRWP, and on going running record results to help teachers group for instruction.   
  a.)  There are no SIFE students at P.S. 195 but if there were, these students would be invited to attend the ENL after school 
program and would receive small group instruction from the classroom and ENL teacher.  They would be supported to help 
them catch up to their grade level peers. 
  
b.)  ELLs in Schools Less Than 3 Years 
 For those children that are in US schools for less than 3 years there is strong emphasis on oral language development and 
vocabulary building. Entering and Emerging students in grades K-2 develop their oral language skills practicing with peers 
during accountable turn and talk. Classroom teachers help ELLs develop their oral language proficiency by working on subject 
specific vocabulary, using songs, engaging students in role plays and read-alouds. Teachers incorporate cooperative learning 
strategies into their lessons. Students work on various projects collaboratively. For instance, they create highly engaging 
collaborative posters. This helps create a low stress environment for newcomers and develop their conversational as well as 
social skills. In collaboration with general education teachers, our ENL teachers within the Stand-Alone ENL classroom prepare 
students for the high academic language demands of various content areas by providing more targeted instruction on 
academic vocabulary and language structures necessary for them to be active participants of the upcoming lessons. 
Additionally, students work on their writing and speaking skills by discussing their own writing with others within a small 
group. Newcomers  are allowed to write in their native language. Then they translate it to English with the help of their peers 
who speak the same language, their ENL teacher (one of whom speaks the language spoken by the majority), or using google 
translate services. After practicing within a small group, they share their writing in English with the class. Slowly 
translanguaging develops, which helps ELLs gradually transition to English. As they start using English more, their home 
language support decreases. Mondo’s, Let’s Talk About It! is another oral language based program we use which develops 
vocabulary using stimulating photos.  Mondo’s oral language assessments are given to students in order to place them 
appropriately. This structure is also used for any photograph teachers use in the classroom.  Children are reassessed 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

periodically.  Newly enrolled ELLs who are entering the school system in grade 3 or above, are introduced to the book, 
Newcomer Phonics by Longman.  It provides children with a basic foundation in the English language as quickly as possible. 
These children are also engaged in an interactive theme-based CD – ROM series by Evan Moor - Look, Listen and Speak. These 
CDs provide basic theme-based vocabulary lessons.  Stories on tape are also used with children on all grade levels in order to 
develop and improve listening skills. 
     The ENL teacher teaches with the general classroom teacher in kindergarten and first grade classrooms. Curriculum 
mapping is designed by the teachers who align their lessons with the Common Core Learning Statndards and the Social Studies 
Scope and Sequence.  Instruction is rigorous and there is 50% use of fiction books and 50% use of nonfiction books.  At this 
time writing is being taught, simultaneously and tailored to the CCLS  using Lucy Calkin’s Primary Units of Study, A Yearlong 
Curriculum.  Children tell their personal stories by using the language of storytelling then illustrating them and finally writing 
the words. Other genres of writing are introduced during the year which allows ELLs to gain experience with literary art 
formats.  The teacher works with the ESL children in small groups differentiating instruction to tailor the needs of the children.  
  
c.)  ELLs Receiving Services 4-6 Years  
Currently, there are two students who have been in the ESL Program for more than three years. These students are invited to 
attend the morning academic intervention program, the ESL after school program, and  receive small group instruction from 
the classroom and ESL teachers.  They are supported to help them catch up to their grade level peers. 
d.)  There are no long term ELLs at the school, but if there were their learning needs would be met by assessing the reason why 
these students are not passing the NYSESLAT and tailoring instruction for each student individually based on their needs. 
  
There is also a Title III After School Program for ELLs and former ELLs.  ELLs attend the program on Tuesdays and Wednesdays 
for 1 1/2 hours per session for a total of 3 hours weekly for approximately 15 weeks.  The Program addresses the needs of ELLs 
and Special Education ELLs in grades K-5.  The goal of this program is to improve the language proficiency level of these 
children by stimulating language production, building vocabulary, modeling appropriate speech, teaching the skills necessary 
for reading and writing and expanding listening comprehension.  In grades kindergarten through grade 2 the research- based 
materials used, Language First! Program and Leveled Reading Series by Leapfrog Schoolhouse address the needs of the 
beginner, intermediate and advanced student. Children also use the Options Best Practices in Reading series which builds 
comprehension skills and strategies.   ELLs in the testing grades 3-5 will focus on test taking skills.  They will use both ELA 
practice materials and NYSESLAT practice materials.  For most of the children in this group, they are first time New York state 
test takers.   
  
e) All of the ELLs at P.S. 195, current and former are invited to participate in all of the activities during the school day and after 
school.  After school activities include Test Taking Strategies for ELA, math and science.  The school psychologist and social 
worker also make themselves available to ELLs.     
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
  
Teachers of ELL-SWDs use explicit instructional strategies that both access to academic content areas and accelerate English 
language development by separating tasks into smaller components.  Separating tasks, helps students achieve the goal and 
complete the task.  Teachers use strategies to fit the needs of their students to provide access to academic content areas and 
to accelerate English language development.  Teachers assess their students’ multiple intelligences to see what kind of learner 
they are and then teach using strategies to accommodate their students’ learning styles.  If a child is a visual learner, the 
teacher will use visuals and graphic organizers to help them understand the content and build English language 
development.  If, a child is a kinesthetic learner, the teacher will use manipulatives for a math lesson to accommodate the 
child’s need for physical learning. Etc.  If a child needs help understanding and answering inferential questions, the teachers 
will practice skills on vocabulary and context so students can better understand and cope with the demands of deep inferential 
comprehension.  Teachers teach their students to make a connection between the text and the outside world, to use prior 
knowledge to make a connection with the text and their own lives.  Teachers will introduce and provide practice with the 
different genre features so students will be able to identify the conventions that specific genres follow. This will help ELL-SWDs 
better understand what is being asked of them.  For example, to look for the main idea in a nonfiction book, they could look at 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

the titles and subtitles.  Grade level materials are used with teacher support and students build their knowledge until they can 
use grade level and above materials on their own.      
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our school uses curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWDs within the least 
restrictive environment by using a push in model.  Students work with the ELL teacher within the classroom to support and 
refine student understanding with interdisciplinary content. The goal is to keep students in their general education classroom 
as much as possible and to target  instruction to build upon student strengths.   Some students receive service in an  ESL 
classroom that provides intensive support with content they are struggling with.    The teachers address the students’ 
weaknesses by tailoring instruction.   Instruction is targetted to build upon strengths and address areas in need of 
improvement.  The students are supported to meet their individual needs .  Teachers also schedule to push in to see their 
students when they are the most productive and when the general education teacher is teaching the subject that the student 
has the most difficulty with.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Using results from current running records has identified strategies in need of greater support and are addressed during small 
group instruction.  Using results from the recent MOSL, writing strategies in need of further support are conducted during the 
guided reading period with the support of the ENL teacher.  Lessons, using additional visual resources, are tailored to meet the 
needs of ELL learners daily with for ELA assistance scaffolded support from both the ENL teacher and the classroom 
teacher.  There is after-school program that is used for an extra intervention for an hour a day, twice a week over the course of 
ten weeks.  For the targeted intervention in Math, student work and unit assessments are used inform lessons are conducted 
during the push in program.  Lessons utilize manipulatives from the Go Math program and modified lessons from the Pearson 
program, are tailored to meet the needs of ELL students with tailored instruction. There is a planned for an after-school 
intervention program for an hour a day, twice a week over the course of ten weeks beginning in January.  The ENL teacher 
works with ELL students during a Math period while the classroom teacher works with the remaining students.  Conferencing 
notes are used to guide future planning based on students’ needs based one each students’ areas of weakness. 
  
The success of the ENL program is due to the collaborative efforts of the ENL and the classroom teachers with the goal of 
helping each ELL meet or exceed New York State and City learning standards.   Teachers come together to plan during their 
common preparation periods.  Teachers work together to deliver a balanced approach to literacy as well as to tailor content 
area instruction, with the appropriate language support, to meet the needs of ELLs.  Instruction is designed to differentiate 
learning since most classrooms are composed of students with different levels of English language proficiency and subject area 
knowledge. Classroom teachers and the ESL teacher meet to articulate the instructional plan for the week to ensure curricular 
alignment incorporating the necessary methodology and instructional strategies to present those lessons to the 
ELLs.  Classroom teachers are supportive of and respectful of the cultural differences of their students.  They create an 
environment which values each student’s background.  Formal and informal assessments are on-going and include portfolios 
and projects to determine growth towards meeting the standards.     
ENL instruction is current with trends and theories and has attended numerous off-site conferences and seminars given by 
experts in the field such as Krashen, Cummins and Chamot.  Targeted interventions for Social Studies are addressed in the 
Social Studies Units of Study.  It is tailored to meet success for all students.  Teachers are using culminating tasks to understand 
the CCLS in Reading and Writing. Targeted intervention for Science is addressed in the Science curriculum and is connected to 
the Social Studies Units of Study. Teachers also use the Holt Science Program where lessons are scaffolded to meet the needs 
of struggling students. Native Language support is used when needed through Language dictionaries, Google translate, peer 
translating and sometimes translating through para professionals.  Teachers respect the culture and language of our ELLs and 
allow students to turn and talk in their native language to help their understanding.  The data that is used is student work, 
summative and formative assessments and teacher observations.  This data is gathered and analyzed to support ELL learners. 
Fiction and nonfiction texts are in content areas to help motivate and inform students.  
The computer program MyOn Reader provides thousands of digital books from home and school, public libraries and other 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

locations.  MyON Reader is available all day, every day so students can continue to choose high interest books and self-manage 
their own reading growth whenever they are self-motivated to do so. Students, educators and administrators have access to 
reports that summarize reading growth. Reports are available to illustrate initial reading level, how much time students have 
spent reading, quiz and comprehension results, and benchmark scores. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our professional development model identifies one session per month that includes strategies that can be used with all 
learners.  This model will continue for this school year    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
  
  
P.S. 195 is equally committed to ensuring the academic success of our ELLs. This target group consists of kindergarteners and 
first graders who are at the entering and emerging levels of English language proficiency as per their NYSITELL and or 
NYSESLAT scores.  They will attend an Early Childhood ENL After-School Program designed to increase their oral language skills 
as well as their literacy skills. This is because the majority of our ELLs are in grades K-2, our Title III After School Program 
reflects that population.  Differentiated instruction will be practiced to meet the needs of individual students using ENL 
methodology.  This early intervention will help to minimize the number of At-Risk and Special Education ELLs in the future. This 
year Options Publishing series Best Practices in Reading will be purchased and used with both kindergarten and first 
grade.  This research based series teaches comprehension and vocabulary skills and is organized thematically.  This series 
complements the school’s literacy plan by pairing fiction with non-fiction.  NYSESLAT test prep materials will also be purchased 
for these two target groups to familiarize them with the NYSESLAT format which is given in early May. The teachers are all 
early childhood certified.   
This is a Title III After School Program for ELLs and former ELLs.  ELLs attend the program on Wednesdays and Thursdays 
beginning November for 1 1/2 hours per session for a total of 3 hours weekly for approximately 15 weeks.  The Program 
addresses the needs of ELLs and Special Education ELLs in grades K-5.  The goal of this program is to improve the language 
proficiency level of these children by stimulating language production, building vocabulary, modeling appropriate speech, 
teaching the skills necessary for reading and writing and expanding listening comprehension.  In grades kindergarten through 
grade 2 the research- based materials used, Language First! Program and Leveled Reading Series by Leapfrog Schoolhouse 
address the needs of the beginner, intermediate and advanced student. Children also use the Options Best Practices in Reading 
series which builds comprehension skills and strategies.   ELLs in the testing grades 3-5 will focus on test taking skills.  They will 
use both ELA practice materials and NYSESLAT practice materials.  For most of the children in this group, they are first time 
New York state test takers.    
The ENL teacher coordinates the Program.  She also pushes-in to the classes and provides additional support where 
needed.  The ESL teacher orders and distributes materials, writes and sends letters home and maintains all record-keeping for 
the Title III Program.  In order for the Program to begin in November, coordinating will begin in October and will be on going, 
as needed. This year our school successfully implemented readers theater into the ENL after-school program. This allowed 
students to develop their language skills in the most interactive and engaging way. We plan to continue this practice in 2017-
2018. 
All of the ELLs at P.S. 195, current and former are invited to participate in all of the activities during the school day and after 
school.  After school activities include Test Taking Strategies for ELA ,math and science, Friday Homework Helper, and 
dance.  The school psychologist and social worker also make themselves available to ELLs.

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
    Smart Boards are used every day in instruction especially for the benefit of ELLs.  Smart Boards allow teachers to 
demonstrate the topic they are teaching about through visuals, videos, and Google translate.  The computer teacher also helps 
other teachers locate various websites for ELLs to help them with specific topics and areas they individually need help within 
vocabulary expansion, phonics, grammar, sentence structure, etc. 
    To further ensure that the needs of these ELLs are being met the role of technology as a resource for instruction is 
implemented.  Students engage in individualized instruction to meet their specific needs.  Research in second language 
acquisition (Krashen, 1989) has clearly suggested the need of comprehensible input in order for second language learning to 
take place. Computers utilize a multi-sensory collection of text, sound, pictures, video and animation to provide meaningful 
contexts to facilitate comprehension. Technology also provides students with language experiences as they move through the 
various stages of language acquisition.  Beginning with the use of multimedia to provide comprehensible input in the pre-
production or silent period, students progress to programs that require limited responses, and in the more advanced stages 
use their second language as they manipulate technology to complete a task. The school’s technology teacher conducts these 
classes.   
      Newcomers get extra instructional practices through various tools to help their transition to an English only school faster 
and easier.  They are given computer programs to help their phonics and reading skills through Raz-kids and Headsprout. 
The LeapFrog SchoolHouse Program, Language First! which was purchased for the program 6 years ago, will be used with 
newcomers.  The program uses the interactive LeapPad personal learning tool for Newcomers and 36 theme based books to 
develop oral language and essential vocabulary skills for students at all levels of English language proficiency.  Ready, Set,Leap! 
, another LeapFrog Schoolhouse Program which was purchased 7 years ago and will be used with the children in 
kindergarten.  This is a research based multi-sensory program and it includes both a theme-based and literature-based 
teaching approach.  It also meets the special needs of ELLs.  
       NYC Department of Education Social Studies Units of Study offer a wide array of activities,  suggestions on what 
instructional materials can be used, and sample lesson plans aligned with CCSS, and are available for teachers' use. ENL 
teachers adapt these materials for ELLs. These units are a great resource and a great collaborative planning tool which helps 
guide Integrated and Stand-Alone  ENL instruction. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

The students are provided with instruction in their home language to support them academically when necessary.  There are 
multiple staff members who substitute as translators in the child's native language, including one of our ENL teachers. The 
students have access to glossaries and dictionaries in both languages.  Students also utilize peer translation and they "turn and 
talk" in their home language if need be.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

Required services and supports correspond to ELLs' ages and grade levels by differentiation and instructing ELLs with texts one 
reading level above their independent reading levels to promote growth and progress.  Texts are discussed with ELLs to 
promote their listening and speaking proficiency and they answer written questions to promote their reading and writing 
abilities. Resources correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels by instructing not only on grade level, but also on English 
proficiency level to help students reach the proficient level in their English language development.  Materials and activities in 
guided reading support this goal to help students in reading, writing, listening and speaking.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
    N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
     The ENL teacher meets with general education teachers, who have ELL students in their class rooms, during professional 
development time twice a week to discuss ways to support ELLs in the general classrooms. Topics for the school year include 
but are not limited to: Comparing ELA and ENL Standards, Using Sheltered English Instruction in the Content Areas, Social and 
Academic Language, Understanding Levels of Language Proficiency, Academic Rigor for ELLs, Differentiated Instruction, 
Cultural Awareness, the ELA for ELLs. Classroom teachers apply this knowledge when planning their instruction in order to 
meet the needs of ELLs in their classes. Special education teachers and para professionals are given opportunities to attend 
Professional Development on ELLs and they attend when possible.  The ENL teacher attends ongoing PDs regarding helping 
ELLs achieve and plans workshops for teachers to implement ELL strategies to assist ELLs with the Common Core Learning 
standards.  Teachers will implement the new strategies discussed at the workshop and report back to discuss if they were 
beneficial. 
P.S. 195 follows a calendar and cycle of PD opportunities that always includes ELL strategies and ways to support ELL students. 
The workshops for staff in content areas consist of learning or turn keying a strategy the first Monday of the month.  Practicing 
it and then analyzing student work as data to see how it affected students’ learning. Sharing what teachers noticed is on the 
third Monday of the month, and then celebrating and tailoring the strategy to see how it could have been done differently and 
more effectively.  
  
The ENL Teacher attends Professional development in supporting ELLs as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards 
provided by the Board of Education whenever possible. This information is shared during common preparation periods or 
during a turn-key. The ENL teacher attends on-going PD and plans workshops throughout the year for teachers to implement 
ELL strategies to assist ELLs with the Common Core Learning standards.  Teachers will implement the new strategies discussed 
at the workshop and report back to discuss if they were beneficial.  These PDs support teachers in delivering CCLs aligned 
instruction, such as: 
-Creating supportive/ respectful environments to help ELL use of language 
-RTI for ELLs 
-Utilizing Common Core Unit Plans 
-Effective Planning 
-Using Formative Assessment to Drive Instruction 
-Supporting ELLs Across Content Areas 
-Effective Questioning 
-Instruction to Meet All Student Needs

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
TESOL training is provided with on-going professional development that equals over 7.5 hours during faculty conferences to all 
staff members as per CR Part 154.  The ENL teacher meets with general education teachers, who have ELL students in their 
class rooms, during professional development time once a week, on (day and time TBD) to discuss ways to support ELLs in the 
general classrooms. Records are maintained by either the ENL teacher taking notes, or emailing the content discussed to our 
principal. Those PD hours for teachers of SWDs are recorded as well (10 hours).   
The ENL teacher provides support to the staff who assists ELLs as they transition from one school level to another by supplying 
all information that is given from the school regarding middle school (such as open houses dates and general information 
about the middle schools) in the parents native language as well as notices in English.  The ENL teacher is available to discuss 
how to research middle schools based on the school's ENL programs to benefit the ELL students with their parents and a 
translator is also available if need be.  The ENL teacher can also contact the ENL teacher from the middle school the child will 
be attending to discuss the child’s progress and goals.       
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
        The school provides annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas through 
individual meetings with parents and the ENL teacher.  These individual meetings are 15-20 minutes and are open to parents 
to attend during specific times that are determined by the principal.  Parents are notified about this “open house” to discuss 
these matters through letters that are sent home. One of our ENL teachers speaks the language of the majority of ELLs' parents 
and provides translation and interpretation services to them. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

  
P.S. 195 has an active parent association that works with the school and other parents.  Parents’ needs are evaluated through 
the ENL teacher who assesses the Home Language Surveys to predict the native language the parents speak, along with 
conversations over the phone or in person at parent-teacher meetings in September.  Translators are available if parents need 
them to communicate effectively.  Parents are asked through DOE materials if interpreters are needed.  Resources are 
provided for them on the DOE website and teachers direct parents to the proper websites that contain the information the 
parents are looking for.  
At P.S. 195, parental participation is valued and on-going. Research has shown when parents are active participants in their 
children’s academic lives, the achievement of English Language Learners improves. The parental involvement activities our 
school offers are monthly Parent Association Meetings where the needs of the parents are addressed. The Parent Coordinator 
along with the President of the Parent Association organize these meetings. Notices are sent home in the parents’ native 
languages as per the Language Translation and Interpretation funding.  At the beginning of the school year, parents are invited 
to meet with their children’s teachers to discuss the rigorous curriculum, address the Standards and the school’s expectations 
for high achievement for all. The ENL teacher also conducts on-going meetings for parents of ELLs during the course of the 
school year. Translators are available in the school building during the course of the school day when needed.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Bernadette Toomey, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We have staff members that are proficient in Russian, the home language of most students and families. If they speak 
another language other than Russian, students will have access to translators. The parent coordinator will also remain 
in contact with parents and refer them to translation services and notify teachers if they prefer to speak and 
communicate in their home language. Teachers can also refer to students HLIS to preview students' home languages. 
Phone calls will be received as well as emails that can be translated in multiple languages. Letters and pertinent 
information disseminated to parents will be translated in their home language as well as a copy in English. We also 
use class messenger to notify parents daily as well as a school robotic call that goes out all all parents/ guardians in 
case of emergency.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Staff members will be notified of students home languages once entering their classroom. They will also be notified if 
the students receive ELL services as well as parents preferred language. Staff members will provide translations of as 
many documents as possible and have translators or a service on hand in order to communicate to parents.  

 

Staff members will discuss how to receive assistance in parent communication during after school professional hours. 
The LAC will also notify staff members of how to access the interpretation services through contracted DOE vendors.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents
