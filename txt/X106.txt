Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Through rigorous instruction and combined efforts, the PS 106 staff, families and community members will strive to 
meet the intellectual, emotional and social needs of every student. We will foster a positive work ethic and create an 
environment that instills tolerance and respect for all. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Public school 106 is located in the Parkchester Section of the Bronx, New York. This pre-kindergarten to fifth grade 
school serves a population of approximately 1116 students from culturally diverse backgrounds. Through 
heterogeneous grouping and ethnic diversity, the student population is fully integrated. Integration of curriculum 
occurs through interdisciplinary studies. There are 45 classes covering grade levels Pre K through fifth. The total 
Special Education population is 214 students. There are 6 self-contained special education and 8 Collaborative Team 
Teaching classes.  

 

This school is a well-kept building where pride in the students’ accomplishments is evident in the prominently 
displayed student work and recognition. The building's extension provides state of the art science labs, a modernized 
library and cafeteria, and music and art classrooms.  

 

Through the collaborative efforts of the P.S. 106 community, our vision is to inspire, challenge and motivate each 
student in order to meet the performance standards. Our goal is to differentiate instruction so that we can meet the 
diverse needs and learning styles of all students. Believing in the educational philosophy that students learn best 
through active engagement, we are committed to making sure all learners are actively participating in all learning 
tasks. To ensure instruction in all core subjects, departmentalization was successfully implemented on the fourth 
grade. Departmentalization will expand to fifth grade during the 2018-2019 school year. As part of the Instructional 
Focus Cohort, P.S. 106 has had the opportunity to reflect upon and refine our engagement practices using feedback 
from the cohort. It is also our goal to include experiences in the arts, physical education, enrichment activities, and 
technology, so that we attend to the development of the whole child. In conjunction with various external 
organizations, P.S. 106 students participate in activities such as Dancing Classrooms, and Park Avenue Amory 
Education. P.S. 106 was awarded a mini-residency in the Disney Musicals in the School Program for school years 
2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019. Students also have the opportunity to continue and enhance their learning in 
the YMCA, Ultimate Enrichment, and Bangla School program after school hours. As part of the PS 106 community, 
parents/guardians are invited to participate in the NAACP Parent Leadership program. We believe such programs 
strengthen unity amongst all members of the PS 106 family. A continuation of our PBIS S.T.A.R.S program will 
encourage and reinforce a positive school culture. Our intent is to create a community of lifelong learners and 
prepare our students for a college and career readiness education. This will be based upon the New York State 
Common Core Learning Standards and through Danielson’s Framework for Teaching. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

The total ENL population is 182 students in Grades K-5, whose needs vary from learning the basic language skills to 
refining their reading and writing skills to perform at grade level. They are provided with an instructional program that 
incorporates English Language immersion using a push-in/pull-out model. ENL students can participate in the ENL 
Saturday Academy and ENL parents are offered classes on Saturday to learn English. Students in grades 1-5 are also 
offered Saturday Academic Intervention Services. Students in Grades 3-5 are also offered Saturday Academic 
Intervention Services; Grades 3-5 students also receive preparatory classes for the ELA and Math State exams. 

 

There are 214 students with IEPs. This includes students in self-contained and ICT classes, as well as students who 
receive SETTS, speech, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and guidance services. The needs of these students 
range from basic academic skills to social/emotional adeptness.  

 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Progress: 

 

During the 2017/2018 school year, P.S. 106 has made progress in the areas of"Rigorous Instruction" and "Strong 
Family Community Ties". The "Rigorous Instruction" Framework was key in developing our school's Instructional Focus 
centered on student engagement. Teachers utilized formative and summative assessments in order to drive 
instruction. Through collaborative team discussions, teachers have developed engaging and differentiated tasks to 
meet the needs of every learner. The majority of the teacher teams have developed systems to use for effective 
planning. Progress in "Strong Family and Community Ties" is evident in the increased participation in parent 
workshops. The majority of teachers communicate with families regarding student progress and behavior regularly via 
Class Dojo. The P.S. 106 website as well as grade level newsletters keep families informed of school and class events 
and provide useful resources. 

 

Areas of Focus: 

 

During the 2018/2019 school year, "Supportive Environment", and "Effective Leadership" frameworks will be an area 
of focus for P.S. 106. Focusing on the "Supportive Environment" framework will involve the entire P.S. 106 community 
supporting the social and emotional growth of our students. A review of protocols for dealing with student crisis 
situations and de-escalation techniques will provide staff with the necessary tools for managing student. Our PBIS 
STAR program and continued implementation of Class Dojo will monitor student behavior and will foster student-
centered learning environments. To address the "Effective Leadership" and "Collaborative Teacher" Frameworks, 
administrators will provide professional development opportunities that will enhance student self-assessment

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. During the 2017-2018 school year, students were assessed quarterly using A to Z running records. Data was 
collected and organized on the Fountas and Pinnell Running Record Growth Chart. Grade K-2 teachers implemented 
Fundations and guided reading groups to improve students' reading level. The Universal Literacy Coach worked 
closely with K-2 teachers to customize instruction in order to share and refine guided reading techniques.  

 

2. Data from the Fountas and Pinnell Running Record Growth Chart shows that 15% of first grade students read at or 
above the expected level in November 2017. By June 2018, 26% of first grade students read at or above the expected 
level, indicating only an eleven percentage point gain. Although Fundations and Journeys guided reading is available 
for all K-2 classes, classroom observations have noted inconsistent use of these programs. Emphasis on decoding and 
fluency must be placed in grade K-2 classrooms through integration of rigorous and engaging activities. Increased 
support from the Universal Literacy Coach in grade 2 will provide teachers with additional strategies needed to bring 
students to grade level standards. Moving forward data analysis will be refine to reflect performance in specific sub-
groups. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 50% of second grade students, inclusive of ELLs, SWDs, and Boys of Color, will read at or above a level M 
as indicated on the Fountas and Pinnell Running Records Growth Chart.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. PS 106 has implemented structures that foster a nurturing environment through our Positive Behavior Intervention 
System (PBIS), which incorporates STARS and Class Dojo. Both STARS and Dojo positively contribute to the academic 
and social emotional development of all students.  

 

2. According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide Survey, only 73% of teachers responded positively regarding 
classroom behavior. In addition, during the 2017-2018 school year,there were 82 reported incidents regarding 
student behavior as reported on the Online Occurrence Reporting System. Over the 2016 - 2017 school year, there 
have been inconsistencies in the PBIS implementation. Improvements have been made towards our school-wide 
standard of academic and behavioral expectations, however uniformity in classroom management still needs to be 
executed. These expectations need to be clearly communicated and utilized by all staff and students. 

  

3. In order to support the whole child, our school continues to implement the STARS PBIS system as well as Class Dojo. 
Our Guidance Counselor, De escalation team, and IEP team support classroom teachers in order to provide a safe 
learning environment. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, there will be a 12% decrease in the incidences reported on the Online Occurrence Reporting System.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

1. The 2017-2018 Principal's Performance Observation noted inquiry-based collaborations as an area of celebration 
for PS 106. Teacher teams analyze assessment data and student work for focus groups resulting in student progress. 
Collaborations among teachers promote the achievement of school goals and enhance the implementation of CCLS. 
Kindergarten and first grade utilized data sheets that focused on running records. The "Inquiry- A Deeper Look at your 
Class Data" worksheet was introduced to kindergarten and first grade teachers to organize their inquiry work.  

2.Although it was an area of celebration on the 2017-2018 PPO, collaboration among teachers in reference to 
effective inquiry work needs to be refined. Clear, focused, inquiry cycles based off of meaningful, timely and 
accessible data need to be implemented in order to help our students get to the next level in math and reading. 
System wide protocols for inquiry work must be created, modeled and applied in order to move students to the next 
level. 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, a school-wide system, Analyzing Student Learning Protocol (ASL), will be developed in order to track and 
identify progress during inquiry cycles to produce effective student learning strategies and improve levels of student 
achievement as measured by a 10 percentage point increase in the area of academic press on our School Quality Guide 
Survey.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

1. P.S. 106 continues to make strides in the area of Strong Family and Community ties. PS 106 has a school website 
and distributes monthly grade newsletters that keep the school community informed of upcoming curriculum and 
social events. The Parent Coordinator has organized many parent workshops and events throughout the year. The 
2016-2017 Quality Review noted that P.S 106 has celebrations and special assemblies that engage parents as 
partners. Implementation of I Ready, MyOn, Reading A-Z, and instruction programs have aided teachers in assessing 
student progress and refining curriculum as needed. Additionally, Class Dojo has become a valuable method of 
informing parents about the daily occurrences in their child's classroom. 

2. Although progress has been made, P.S. 106 received a score of 2.65 in the Strong Family-Community Ties 
Framework on the 2016-2017 School Quality Guide. This score is 0.40 points below the District-wide average and 0.80 
points below the City-wide average. There is still a need to deepen communication with parents as well as provide 
more opportunities for parent involvement within our school community as evidenced by a score of 88 percent on the 
2017-2018 School Quality Guide Survey.  

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, the school will increase parent involvement by diversifying engagement opportunities (meetings, 
workshops, fairs, etc.) to support student learning and development as indicated by a 92% positive rating in the "Parent 
Involvement in School" category on the School Quality Guide survey.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. PS106, The Parkchester School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

PS. 106 The Parkchester School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report;

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the ESSA; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers; 

● providing written and verbal progress reports that are periodically given to keep parents informed of their 
children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

P.S. 106 will have 4 certified ENL teachers and 3 Content Area Specialists working together as 
teams in the Direct Instruction Supplemental Program. Based on data in the EDE estimator tool, 
attendance rosters, MOSL results, State ELA and Math test results (grades 3-5), test scores were 
analyzed, and the ENL Department, in conjunction with classroom teachers, determined that 
ELLs in grades 1 through 5 would be best served by an instruction program which focuses on 
literacy and language development to enhance academic skills in the areas of reading 
comprehension and expository writing. 
Beginning the week of March 4, 2019, students will receive English Language instruction in the 
Title III supplemental program on Wednesdays and Thursdays after school for two hours (2:45 - 
4:45), two days per week. The sessions will be taught in English and focus on English language 
acquisition through building vocabulary skills in the content areas, particularly in social studies 
and science. Instruction will focus on reading comprehension and emphasize informational texts 
as a necessary component of literacy instruction in ENL. Class work will prioritize finding 
meaning in context, using higher-order thinking skills, and building word analysis skills, based 
on prefixes, suffixes, and Latin roots. Placement of students in flexible groupings will be 
determined through a diagnostic writing assessment. Student progress will be assessed through 
writing pieces and teacher-made tests. 
The direct instruction supplemental program for ENLs will be offered in English and facilitated 
by 3 ENL-certified teachers, and 4 content teachers. Home language support will be provided 
with glossaries, bilingual dictionaries, and visual dictionaries. 
The ENL  teachers will work in conjunction with the content teachers employing a co-operative 
team teaching approach. There will be one class offered per grade level. The program will be 
offered in a small group format with each class's participants capped at 20 students selected 
based on their country of birth, as per the P.S. 106 RPOB. The ratio of students to teacher will be 
10:1 based on teacher certification: content, ENL or Bilingual. The language of instruction will 
be English. The ratio of instructional time for ENL and content area teachers will be 50:50. 
The program will run for 15 weeks, from March 4,  2019,  through May 17, 2019. Two 2-hour 
sessions are planned per week. We have planned 20 sessions for the program (two sessions per 
week, for two hours per session). The cost will be 20 sessions x 2 hours x $50.13  x 7 
teachers=$14,036.40.  The majority of the Title III allocation ($14,036.40) will be used towards 
instruction. The remaining $3,063.60 will be used towards instructional supplies. 
The program will serve 100 to 120 students. Students will be grouped by grade level and English 
proficiency level, with newcomer immigrants grouped separately from students who have been 
in the country for a longer period of time.  
The materials required for the program are Reading A-Z, Learning A-Z, and Focus on Science 
(Steck-Vaughn) and  Focus on Social Studies (Steck-Vaughn). These materials are supplemental 
and distinct from those used for daily instruction. Teachers will use readings, comprehension 
questions, graphic organizers, and writing exemplars to guide students in strengthening their 
expository writing skills. Students will engage in small-group discussion, identification of main 
idea and supporting details, and how to write an effective introductory sentence, culminating in 
the writing of a 3- to 4-paragraph composition.

Begin description here:            
Rationale: Research shows that high-quality ongoing professional development both 
deepens teachers' content knowledge and pedagogical skills while providing opportunities for 
practice, research, and reflection. Ongoing staff professional development will be provided to the 
teacher team involved in the Title III program. Teachers working in the Title III program will 
receive ongoing PD pertaining to best practices in the teaching of ELLs. The Direct Instruction 
teacher team will be given opportunities to attend citywide conferences, BFSSC Professional 
Development workshops, as well as professional development workshops given by the NYC 
DOE. Teacher PD will positively impact the progress of ELLs through focused strategy 
development to improve ELLs' continued growth in achieving greater spoken and written 
command of academic language and vocabulary. 
 
P.S. 106's professional development program for the Title III Program teachers is centered on 
training in the acceleration of literacy skills acquisition across the four modalities: Listening, 
Speaking, Reading, and Writing. Two lead Teachers specializing in ENL and Literacy provide 
professional development to teachers in our after-school program. The topics under consideration 
for the Title III professional development will focus on: 
 
- Pre-reading activities for ELLs 
- Activating Background Knowledge for ELLs 
- Effective Strategies for Teaching Content Vocabulary 
- Developing Oralcy for ELLs 
All PD providers are certified ENL or Bilingual Teachers. The ENL Department Providers are: 
1. Ms. Frances Cleary, ENL (M.A., TESOL; M.S., Literacy K-5) 
2. Mr. Jake Ehrlich, ENL (M.A., TESOL expected May 2019) 
3. Ms. Katherine Ocampo-Mosquera, ENL (M.A., TESOL expected May 2019) 
4. Ms. Denise Ranelli, ENL (M.A., TESOL) 
 
Professional Development will be delivered during 2 after school Professional Development time 
slots from 2:40 to 3:45 p.m.  One PD will take place in November 2018, and one will take place 
in January 2019. All teachers and paraprofessionals at P.S. 106 will participate in this training. 
Records will be maintained through agendas and attendance sheets. These P.D.'s will incur no 
cost to the Title III budget.

Begin description here:            
Rationale: New immigrant parents benefit from parent workshops as they learn to acclimate to 
life in New York City. According to the needs analysis conducted during the intake process, 
many parents experience a disconnect in knowing how to best support their children with 
homework and English language development. New parents also often lack the knowledge of 
knowing where to obtain ENL instruction for themselves in the community. 
During SY 18-19 ENL parents will have the opportunity to become Learning Leaders in our 
school. Once a month during our Tuesday Parent Involvement time (Tuesdays, from 2:40-3:10), 
we will provide our ENL parents with hands-on workshops to equip them with strategies for 
seeking out local ENL classes for themselves and supporting their children with their homework 
and/or language development. 
Parents of Title III immigrant students and parents of ENL students will be invited to attend a 
literacy program focused on a culture study given by the ENL Department and geared to the 
literacy development of the children in the Title III Immigrant program. The cultures will be 
chosen from among the PS 106 school's student immigrant population, e.g., Bengali, Domican, 
Ghanian, Senegalese, and so forth (exact dates TBD, November, 2018, and March, 2019; 10 a.m. 
to 2 p.m.) and takes place on a Saturday. For example, the aforementioned parents will be invited 
to two "Multicultural Days" held at P.S. 106. Each of these days will feature a celebration of the 
music, dance, and food from our immigrant families' cultures. 
The goal is for the parents of the ELLs and the parents of the Title III children to work with their 
children on developing English oralcy skills through sharing about their respective cultures. ENL 
Teachers will model for parents how to use question techniques to help students to speak and 
share more orally. Parents will be invited to share their country's food, music, songs, instruments, 
as well as cultural experiences, to encourage an oral English literacy interaction with the 
children. 
Activities for each day will include listening to songs from the chosen culture and watching short 
music videos featuring that culture's music, instruments and dance. There will also be short 
presentations about each cultural group's favorite foods. ENL teachers will work with parents 
and their children in small groups on vocabulary relevant to the presentations: the language of 
music, dance, and cooking/culinary arts. At one of the tables guided by a bilingual or ENL 
teacher, children will be able to create an art project related to one of the presentations. For 
example, a child might create a musical instrument out of construction paper, then share-out 
about what he/she created using the vocabulary learned from the parent presentations. 
Parents and their children will be invited by letter, translated into their native language. Title III 
Funds will be used for supplies, such as construction paper, crayons, glue, and scissors. It will 
also be used for refreshments (juice, coffee, milk, sugar), paper plates, utensils (TBD). Records 
will be maintained with Sign-in sheets, agendas, invitations in the parents' home language. 
Parents' invitations will be backpacked home by their children. 
The names of the providers for the ENL workshop/events/meetings are: 
1. Ms. Frances Cleary, ENL Teacher

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
The initial assessment used for determining a student's level of English proficiency is the NYSITELL test, which measures the 
student's command of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Test results indicate if a possible ELL student might require 
services as well as their specific areas of strength and weakness. Test results drive subsequent instruction. Student Data 
gathered from formative and summative curriculum-based assessments guide instructional planning. 
Incoming Spanish Speaking Students take the Spanish Lab-R exam, as well as the NYSITELL. Curricuum-embedded assessments 
include: 
Basic Literacy and Math Assessment (Alphabet, sounds, numbers, shapes, etc.) 
Dolch Sight Word Assessments 
Reading A-Z Running Records 
Fountas and Pinnell Reading Records 
Go-Math Assessments 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

ELL Performance Assessments 
NYSESLAT Practice Books 
MOSL Literacy and Math Tests 
I-Ready Literacy and Math Assessments 
NYC Baseline/Mid-line/Endline Tests 
Performance and Writing Tasks 
Formal and informal assessment data assist instructional staff with daily, weekly and long-term planning for students and how 
to plan instruction for the ELL population. This data also provides the school with short and long-term goals, planning 
curriculum, ordering grade-specific materials, and appropriating the necessary school staff in order to meet the needs of the 
students.  
     
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Assessment planning and implementation structures developed to support this effort are OPT Meetings, Teacher Team 
Meetings, ENL Dept. Meetings (weekly), Inquiry Work, Weekly Professional Development, and the School Leadership Team 
meetings. 
Collaboration between ENL and content teachers is highly valued. Teachers meet once or twice per week during prep periods 
to plan instruction, and some ENL/content teacher pairs utilize Google Drive to great effect to seamlessly add differentiation to 
lesson plans and share them in real time.  
 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The success of the P.S. 106 program for ELLs is evaluated through grade level and schoolwide team meetings using data 
collected from informal, formative, and summative curricular assessment results. Other components include articulation and 
collaboration among teachers, as well as setting teacher, grade-level, and school-wide goals in order to meet the AYP for ELLs.  
P.S. 106 receives a Safe Harbor status for ELL students, reflecting that P.S. 106 meets AYP for its ELL population.   P.S. 106 
evaluates the success of the ENL Program through multiple measures.    
For example: 
* State tests (e.g., achievement tests, MOSL, NYSESLAT/NYSITELL and state and local goals); 
*  Standardized tests, including norm-referenced examinations and criterion-referenced tests; 
*  Teacher observation measures, rubrics and checklists; 
*   Baseline and Field Tests; 
*   Running Records; 
*   Common Core-aligned teaching criteria 
*   Student self-reflection/assessment, teacher/peer conferencing, peer-to-peer assessment; 
*   Report cards; 
*   Promotion rates; 
*   Inclusion of ELL students in gifted and talented, and other special programs; 
*   EDAT Tool Analysis  
*   NYC Performance Assessments 
*    ENL Field Tests and Periodic Assessments 
*   IReady ELA and Math Assessments, individualized and group quantifications 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

 The structures in place  to address interventions are OPT Meetings, Teacher Team Meetings, Dept. Meetings, Interventions, 
including RTI, Saturday Academy, Inquiry Work, Professional Development, including monthly ELL meetings and Monday 
meetings after-school, and the School Advisory Committee. Also, the Literacy Coach, Special Ed and Language Proficiency 
Teams are convened when necessary to assist with student interventions. Once summative data has been gathered at the 
school and/ or grade levels, it is shared throughout the school via grade-level meetings, professional development planning, or 
department meetings. Interventions are discussed and ways to implement the interventions are put into a plan of action. Also, 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

the Teacher, Coach, team member or department who will be teaching, advising and monitoring the student interventions, 
records the Data and student progress in order to meet the goals of the student intervention. That information is shared with 
the teachers, paras, or the teams involved.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
P.S. 106 uses the Multi-Tiered Model in order to guide instruction for ELLs, following the RTI framework.  
A. Using the three (3) Tiered model, which includes the core instructional program at Tier 1, targeted interventions for ELL 
students who need additional help at Tier 2 and for those requiring intensive interventions at Tier 3, the school has developed 
an RTI team that uses student data to provide timely and effective support.  
B. Plan and coordinate benchmarks, progress monitoring, and intervention planning with staff (when, what, who, where). 
Create an organized plan to accommodate unique needs for ELLs for benchmark and progress monitoring. Student Data is used 
to inform scheduling of the ELLs, student grouping/differentiation, target groups (Inquiry), to decide programming for 
Saturday Academy, tutoring, and enrichment. It is also utilized for goal setting, curriculum selection, creation and resources.  
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Student placement is determined for newcomer students through administration of the NYSITELL exam upon matriculation at 
P.S. 106. The NYSESLAT is given annually each spring to assess individual student growth in language proficiency. Students who 
have a first language that is Spanish are given the Spanish Lab in order to assess their language proficiency in Spanish. 
Additionally, data from performance tasks/assessments, beginning/middle/ending baseline tests, MOSL, State ELA and Math 
tests are used to inform ELL instruction. State ELA and Math test outcomes are compared with NYSESLAT proficiency levels (for 
example, in last year's fourth-grade, 6 out of 7 (2018 - TBD) Expanding ELL students who took the State ELA test scored a 2 ; 3 
out of 8 Expanding students who took the State Math test scored a 3). Such data is continuously analyzed to determine trends 
and modify instruction.  
 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The structures in place are disseminating EDAT, MOSL, ELA and Math test data via Professional Development and meetings 
that explain EDAT and all beneficial ELL Data/Reports and outcome assessments to the staff and related ELL service providers 
in order to make adjustments to the program.  

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 Instruction for ELLs is delivered through the integrated/push-in and stand-alone models. Grades K-5 
receive ENL services in the least restrictive environment. Depending on proficiency level, ENL students are given from 
180-360 minutes of weekly English language instruction. Students are grouped heterogeneously according to grade 
and/or language proficiency levels and travel together as a group for the stand-alone program, with Entering and 
Emerging level ENLs being given 180 of their 360 minutes of instruction at the same time, in groups organized by 
elementary grade band. The stand-alone ENL Model is instructed by a certified K-12 ENL Teacher for Entering and 
Emerging Students for 360 minutes of language study per week. Instruction for Transitioning, Expanding, and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

   The school ensures the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided according to proficiency levels obtained 
from the centrally generated EDAT and RLAT reports. Instruction in the integrated ENL program is provided by certified 
Common Branch classroom teachers and a certified ENL teacher. Instruction in the stand-alone ENL program is provided to 
each grade-level cohort by an appointed ENL teacher. Each ENL Teacher programs their schedule with the Stand-Alone ENL 
Model and Integrated ENL co-teaching Model according to grade levels and proficiency levels. 
   Explicit ENL and ELA (HLA does not apply) instruction is taught by the ENL teachers according to student grade and 
proficiency levels. ENL Teachers' schedules' reflect the teaching of 1 unit of study per week of Stand-alone ENL to the Entering 
and Emerging ELLs and 1 unit of study per week in Integrated ENL to include ELA and Core Content areas. 
Transitioning ELLs receive stand-alone instruction for a total of one unit of study per week and Integrated ENL for one unit of 
study per week to include ELA and Core subjects Content. Expanding ENL students receive one unit of study per week in 
Integrated ENL to include ELA and Content area classes. ENL Teachers service Commanding ENL students for two years after 
the student passes the NYSESLAT Test or upon achievement of a '3' on the State ELA exam for students in grade 3-5. STARS 
Programming and EDUR are received every month and data is entered and maintained into STARS classroom programming. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   Core Content is delivered in English using the Integrated ENL Model with an ENL Teacher co-teaching with a certified K-5 
elementary teacher planning and collaborating together while providing language and content instruction to promote 
academic achievement in content areas using the CCLS. Instruction is given by articulating specific content along with language 
objectives that promote clear language acquisition goals and expectations. Research-based scaffolding such as: visuals, 
artifacts and realia, graphic organizers, multimedia, technology, computers, dictionaries, and flexible groupings, are 
implemented to provide students with both cooperative and independent opportunities to solve problems and engage in oral 
discussions with peers. ENL teachers also utilize materials and instructional resources that are linguistically age/grade 
appropriate and aligned to the CCLS to enhance student engagement, facilitate student monitoring, as well as on-going 
assessments to support the academic achievement of all ELLs including the ELL SWD students in grades K, 1-2, 3-4 and 5. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

At PS 106, the ENL teachers administer the Spanish Lab to all applicable students, as well as the New LENS SIFE screening tool 
and other SIFE Screeners. Additionally, the NLAP is being used to create assessments, lessons, and tasks for ELL students across 
all content areas. The State Exams are translated to accommodate ELLs when requested or to accommodate students 
according to their IEPs.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups?

Differentiating Instruction for SIFE: Once the student home language is determined and the English Baseline assessment has 
been given, ENL Teachers build language and content skills with SIFE students through activation of  prior knowledge using the 
following strategies: phonemic awareness, alphabetic principle, KWL charts, graphic organizers, visuals, manipulatives, hands-
on learning activities, and integrated technology. Students engage in writing and drawing activities, drama (Reader's 
theater) to act out events and stories, and use manipulatives and interactive activities on a SMARTBoard to build social and 
academic content vocabulary. Students work in cooperative groups and develop skills such as getting into groups, taking turns, 
and encouraging one another to provide the foundation for the development of literacy skills. As oral language solidifies, 
students work on reading skills: pre-reading, reading, and summarizing strategies as informed by current literacy research. 
Graphic organizers make learning visual and enhance higher-order thinking skills. Reading logs and journals incorporate 
reading and writing. Continuous informal and formal teacher assessments, along with student self-assessments, determine 
student needs and curricular direction. 
 
Differentiating Instruction for Newcomers:  Many of the same teaching methodologies as above. Also, create a safe 
environment for the new student and if possible, partner up the new student with a student that speaks the same native 
language. Expand on basic language skills, especially verbal skills.  
Differentiation for Developing Students: Same as above but expand on verbal, vocabulary skills and the use of graphic 
organizers and writing skills. 
Differentiation for Long Term ELLs: Same as above but continue to monitor and assess students and continuously reteach and 
regroup.  
Differentiating Former ELLs: Continue to service, monitor and assess student. With each grade, the curriculum becomes 
increasingly difficult and Former ELLs need ENL teacher support in areas such as vocabulary acquisition and grade-level writing 
tasks. Former ELLs are eligible for .5 units of ENL Services and receive ELL Testing Accommodations if eligible.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ENL Department teachers use many different instructional strategies and grade-level materials for the instruction of ELL-
SWD students. Grade-level curricula include Wilson Foundations, Journeys ELA, Go Math, and NYS Science and Social 
Studies programs. Instructional strategies which promote language development include the linking of background knowledge 
and culture to content material; comprehensible input; visuals, hands-on learning through manipulatives, and realia, amongst 
other strategies. Content and Language Objectives are clearly defined and modeled for students. ENL teachers provide access 
to these objectives through the scaffolding of academic language, literacy, and vocabulary acquisition instruction. Vocabulary 
is taught through visuals, TPR, and repeated opportunities for both oral and written application. Classroom interaction 
encourages students to use English to do Academic Tasks. Teachers stimulate higher-order thinking skills through questioning 
techniques and use differentiated learning strategies by explicitly promoting the development of critical, independent thinking. 
Opportunities for employing the four modalities (L,S,R & W) are integrated into every lesson. Materials used during lessons 
may include writing notebooks, tracing sheets, Reading Program books and materials to include Reading and Writing Journals, 
grade-level readers, big books, phonics books, flashcards, posters, whiteboards/erasers, sentence strips, alphabet centers and 
Word Walls, or any type of visual aid, SMARTBOARDS, computers and other types of technology. Teachers continuously review 
and provide feedback during lessons, along with integrated assessments (Thumbs up, exit slips, etc.) Teachers utilize both 
informal and formal Rubric based assessments which are written in student-friendly language and clearly displayed for 
students.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The ENL Teachers at PS 106 teach ELL-SWDs in the Least-Restrictive Environment. The ENL Teacher follows the students’ 
IEP and the IDEA Laws and Guidelines when providing instruction to all ELL-SWD students. To enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their 
IEP goals, instruction is delivered according to the state-ENL mandated minutes. As required, AIS and RTI are scheduled to 
provide additional support in the requisite content areas. Flexible grouping and scheduling among 
ENL/SpecialEd/GenEd teachers is based on individual student need according to the parameters of the ELL-SWD student's IEP. 
Student-friendly language/descriptive review/CAT assessments are employed to assess schedule/strategies being used and 
how to adjust and drive instruction so that each student achieves their IEP goals. Backwards design planning, EDAT training for

staff, fluid scheduling for pull-out/stand-alone instruction, as well as integrated/push-in instruction are all employed to 
maximize progress for ELL-SWD students. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The targeted intervention program at P.S. 106 is the three-tiered Response to Intervention (RTI) model. The core instructional 
program is delivered at Tier 1. Targeted interventions for ELL students who need additional help are delivered in small group 
instruction at Tier 2, and students requiring intensive Tier 3 interventions work with an RTI specialist who provides both ELA 
and math interventions in English. Other intervention programs include AIS taught in English for targeted ELLs who need 
academic intervention in ELA, Literacy and Math. After-school programs include the YMCA and Ultimate Enrichment. 
Technology programs include IReady and MYON, reading programs which serve as multilingual/content area subject resources 
with integrated assessments that assist teachers in determining language development interventions. The 
Wilson Fundations program is co-taught by classroom teachers and ENL/AIS Teachers for 30 minutes each day for grades K-2. 
For grades 3-5 both Literacy and ENL Teachers push-in with the classroom teachers to provide ELA grammar support and 
writing skills interventions in English for all ELLs.  
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

There will be no changes for the upcoming school year. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

PS 106 does not have a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All ELLs are eligible to participate with the non-ELLs in school and in after-school enrichment programs at P.S. 106. These 
include but are not limited to: Saturday Academy, the YMCA, Ultimate Enrichment, Girls Scouts and the Boy Scouts. ELL 
students are eligible to try out for and perform in the annual Black-History Month Show. Fifth-grade ELLs are eligible to try out 
for and perform in the Disney Kids Show awarded to P.S. 106 through a Disney Grant. Scouts programs are also offered for 
grades 2-5. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Instructional materials available to ELLs are the Journeys ELA Reading Program, phonics books, Fundations books, Guided 
Reading books, leveled readers, GoMath curricular materials, manipulatives, realia, along with teacher-created resources, such 
as Powerpoints, graphic organizers, thinking maps, bilingual Word Walls, charts, and other classroom posters which support 
learning of the Alphabetic principle. Technology supports include Smartboards in all classrooms, computers, IPADS, Laptops, 
and online programs such as Enchanted Learning, Starfall, Kahoot, and many other educational websites which promote 
building a core foundation in the English language. 
I-Ready for Math and Reading instruction provide online lessons at each student's level based on results from the online 
adaptive diagnostic. Teacher-led, Next Generation Standards (Math, ELA, Science and Social Studies) instruction builds directly 
on the skills assessed by these diagnostics. The digital book website, MYON.com, personalizes reading for students by 
recommending books based on their interests, reading level, and inventories based on previous reading done by students. 
Students and their parents can access both the Myon and the I-Ready websites from a home or public library computer. The 
instructional materials as well as technology, are utilized by all ELL students, regardless of level, to develop reading and reading 
comprehension skills across the content areas of ELA, Science, and Social Studies. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

PS 106 does not have a DL or Bilingual program. Home Language Support in the ENL program comprises bilingual teachers who 
speak the student's native language to clarify a task or assignment whenever possible. ENL teachers promote students' oral 
and written use of the home language at the entering level for students with no prior exposure to academic English. The 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

 

NYC Spanish Lab test provides information on level of literacy in the home language which informs types of resources to use 
for our Hispanic students. Bilingual glossaries and dictionaries, Standard English dictionaries, student learning styles, and 
classroom grouping choices are all employed to acclimate ENL students at P.S. 106. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

ENL and classroom teachers use only grade-level materials which have been chunked into comprehensible input with visual 
supports for optimal acquisition of the four English language modalities: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The school 
ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to the ELLs' ages/grade levels. Student IEPs are used to ensure 
SWD ELL students' accessibility to grade-level materials.  Classroom and ENL Teachers meet routinely to discuss student grade-
level progress. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Newly enrolled ELLs receive a packet prior to the school year including name tags, supply lists, grade level and expectations, 
room numbers, available after-school programs along with other pertinent forms needed for the beginning of the school year. 
The ENL Department provides an ENL Orientation and sends home newsletters in four languages throughout the year. Small-
group newcomer classes focus on survival English and classroom vocabulary to ensure students start the year confidently and 
productively. Support is also provided by the parent coordinator and school counselor. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

N/A    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Staff development of all ENL personnel at 106 (including classroom teachers and non-pedagogues) includes mentoring, 
workshops for ENL teachers offered by the District, one-on-one support from Field Office Specialists, and city-wide 
professional development training on best practices in ENL co-teaching. ELL staff training for the coming year will focus on 
ways to implement the co-teaching model to maximize language acquisition for all ELLs, in addition to research-driven 
academic vocabulary acquisition strategies. 
Workshops attended by ENL teachers may focus on increasing oralcy for all ELLs to facilitate the development of foundational 
literacy, the teaching of content and language objectives, and best practices in co-teaching. Teachers plan together during 
weekly grade meetings, examine student work, student assessments, and other student data to determine ways in which 
CCLS-aligned curriculum can best meet the needs of ELLs. Teacher meetings and after-school professional development

meetings provide opportunities for ongoing inquiry through teacher team share-outs.  
Records of all professional development participants are kept via a sign-in sheet.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
All teachers and administrators are provided professional development to meet the needs of ENL students through trainings 
provided by the ESL Teacher Team. Projected topics for the 2018-2019 school year are: 
  
1. Teaching Vocabulary through the Inductive Picture Model 
2. Effective Implementation of the Co-teaching Model 
3. Building Academic Language with ELLs in the Content Areas 
 
Records are maintained through Workshop Sign-in sheets and collection of Workshop Agendas. 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
P.S. 106 hosts an annual Parents Evening for parents of ELLs, in addition to the weekly after-school Parents' block of 45 
minutes for ELL parents to meet with members of the ENL team to discuss concerns or questions regarding ENL program 
design and goals, grade-specific language development progressions, language proficiency assessments results, and content-
area language development needs. A school- or outside-based translator can be arranged for newcomer parents. Translation is 
provided by school personnel and parent volunteers on an as-required basis. Parents are made aware of the Office of 
Translation and other resources within the Department of Education. Written communication is distributed in the home 
language in order to communicate with non- English-speaking parents in their home language. Frequently, our Bangla 
population parents will bring a friend or family member with them to meetings for translation purposes. Records of all one-to-
one meetings are kept in the form of sign-in sheets and agendas when applicable.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

PS 106 ELL parents are invited to all classroom and school-wide celebrations that include parties, writing celebrations, book 
fairs, dance ensembles, drama productions, and the Science Exposition, as well as class trips and school-wide festivals and 
programs. Parents are invited to Title I Content Teachers' (Math and ELA) presentations to discuss the curriculum and 
expectations for student academic performance. English language study classes are offered to ELL parents on Saturdays. The 
Parent Coordinator, Ms. L. Cedeno, acts as a liaison to ELL families and is available for simultaneous translations and school 
orientations for all parents of ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Eugenia Montalvo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Families and caregivers are interviewed by the Parent Coordinator, ENL teachers, Administration and Pupil 
Personnel Secretary and queried as to preferred language of communication. Additionally, parents respond to 
Part 3 of Home Language Identification Survey regarding their preferred language for communications with the 
school. ATS Data is collected from Reports and the Parent Survey and parent selection. ATS Data is gathered from 
the Student Emergency Contact cards in order to communicate with ELL parents in their native language if 
needed, whether through written communication or oral translation. The ENL Department also communicates 
with parents through a newsletter translated into the principal languages represented at P.S. 106; namely English, 
Bengali (Bangla), Arabic and Spanish. PS 106 also conducts surveys in order to assess preferences of the parent 
community for oral and written communication.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Use a DOE Language Line to inform parents they can call the school in their language (using a phone script). Also, train 
staff to use the 3-way call system to add Language Line to calls coming into the school.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Most translations are completed In-house in a timely manner unless there is a need for DOE Brochures, Bilingual 
Parent forms or the Language Line. In PS 106, there are many Bilingual Staff members that can translate and write 
documents in multiple languages including: teachers, administrators, guidance counselors and social workers. Also, 
the LAC will turnkey training on Language Line Information and language access to all staff members so that all 
languages can be translated and written in a timely manner and staff is informed of all resources available.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school will provide each parent whose primary language is a covered language and who require language 
assistance services with a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities which includes their rights regarding 
translation and interpretation services. The school will post in a sign and Multilingual Welcome Poster at or near the 
main entrance in each of the covered languages, or most prominent covered languages, indicating the availability of 
interpretation services, especially during parent engagement, meetings and all parent events. The school's safety plan 
will contain procedures for parents in need of language access services. The school in which the parents of more than 
10% of the children speak a primary language that is neither English nor a covered language, shall obtain from the 
Translation and Interpretation Unit a translation of a sign in the needed language. Parents who wish to receive 
language access services can contact the school for information. Language ID Guides can be readily available to the 
parents and kept at the front entrance desk and main office. Brochures, flyers and letters can be shared with parents

during parent engagement events in order to inform parents of different ways to communicate and utilize translation 
services.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The school sends out a Parent Survey in order to obtain information regarding parent's likes and dislikes regarding the 
quality and availability of services. The Surveys are collected and data is obtained. PTA meetings are also held which 
include school staff and administrators in which parent suggestions and feedback are recorded and taken into 
consideration in order to maintain a strong parent and community relationship and to make improvements at the 
school.
