Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The mission of the Peck Slip School is to educate young people to be passionate about learning, curious about others 
and the world, and committed to community engagement. Peck Slip graduates will be active learners and 
independent thinkers who have high standards, the ability to reflect on their skills, understandings and abilities, and a 
desire do their best. The same high standards for excellence apply to academic, artistic, athletic, and social endeavors. 
The impetus for their work will be curiosity about the world and commitment to the diverse communities they 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

participate in – both local (the classroom) and global (the human family and the world we live in). Three core values 
support this mission: 

Learning is a pleasurable, life-long pursuit. Perseverance through challenges underlies success. 
Intelligence is effort-based. There is always more to learn. 

 
 
  Human beings are interdependent. In the classroom and across the world, we rely on one another. 

Developing a sense of gratitude, Peck Slip students will appreciate what the world has to offer and be optimistic that 
their contributions, now and in the future, will make a difference. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Peck Slip School is a zoned elementary school that was founded in September 2012. For 18-19 our enrollment is 
expected to approximately be 480 students in PreK – grade 5. Peck Slip School serves the historic Seaport and 
Financial Districts.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our student population of neighborhood children is heterogeneous, and includes representative but not significant 
populations of ELLs and SWDs. ELLs include a small number of new arrivals requiring siginficant language acquisition 
support and a very small number of ELLs on the cusp of full proficiency. SWD classifications include Other Health 
Impairment, Learning Disability, Autism, Speech & Language Impairment, and Emotional Disturbance.In recent years 
we have seen an increase of students with ASD, ADHD, and Dyslexia. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In 2017-2018 we focused on academic rigor can collaborative teachers. Specifically, we focused on  

Improving reading achievement if striving readers by increasing available intervention programs; 

 
  Deepening reading comprehension through a study of works by Kylene Beers, Robert Probst, and Vicki Vinton; 
  Document assessment calendars for grades PK - 5; 
  Create fifth grade experience (curriculum scope & sequence, fifth grade activities, community service, etc.). 
  We came close to meeting out aspirational goal of 85% of all first and second graders meeting or exceeding 

grade level expectations (as measured by F & P Benchmark Assessment Kit): 82% of first graders & 81% of 
second graders met/exceeded. 

In 2018-2019 this will be the first time we are not adding another grade. Our focus for the upcoming year is 
continuing to make progress in developing rigorous academics. Our specific focuses include: 

  Reading achievement in 3rd & 4th grade with a focus on comprehension & engagement; 
  Continuing to expand our intervention toolkit and increase number of striving students served; 
 
  Continuing cross grade reading buddies to support reading engagement and add monthly school-wide read 

Improve parent communication, adding interactive components; 

 

alouds to encourage conversations about diversity; 
Support teacher development and school-wide coherence through structured vertical & horizontal inter 
visitation; 

  Continued development of in-depth inquiry studies aligned to CCSS reading and writing standards. These 

studies promote highly engaged learning opportunities, rich student talk and thinking, meaningful 
engagement in the arts, and authentic opportunities to do robust non-fiction reading and writing.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Peck Slip continues to have an engaging and rigorous curriculum that is aligned to the CCSS. Relevant data: On the 
2017-2018 School Quality Snapshot in Rigorous Instruction 100% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that they had 
the resources to include opportunities for students to interact with complex grade-level text and to interact with 
academic language. 77% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that students use data or text references to support 
their ideas and build on ideas of others during class discussions. Fountas and Pinnell reading data indicates that SWDs 
are not uniformly progressing at a rate comparable to non-SWD peers. There are no other notable performance 
differences among other subgroups.  

 

In 17-18, we demonstrated high reading achievement across the grades: 

First Grade: 82% met or exceeded grade expectations (with 11% SWDs) 
Second Grade: 81% met or exceeded grade expectations (with 20% SWDs) 

  Kindergarten: 76% met or exceeded grade expectations (with 11% SWDs) 
 
 
  Third Grade: 69% met or exceeded grade expectations (with 27% SWDs) 
 
 

Fourth Grade: 77% met or exceeded grade expectations (with 19% SWDs) 
Fifth Grade: 83% met or exceeded grade expectations (with 17% SWDs) 

While we have seen success in our reading program, we are investigating alternate methods of targeting striving 
readers in the upper grades. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 15, 2019, 85% of third and fourth grade readers will be reading at grade level or above, as measured by the 
Fountas and Pinnell reading assessments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

99% of responding teachers agreed or strongly agreed in four out of the five measures of collaborative teachers on 
the 2017-2018 School Survey. 81% of responding teachers agreed or strongly agreed about the quality of professional 
development at Peck Slip, which is an area we need to improve in.  

 

In 2017-2018 we focused on reading. For the coming year, teachers have collaboratively selected to continue to work 
on reading as our focus area. Based on the 2017-2018 School Survey, teachers feel that our students do not 
consistently build upon the ideas of others in class and provide constructive feedback to their peers. Based on both 
informal and formal observations, many teachers are developing in their skills to teach comprehension through rich 
student discourse. Based on both Fountas and Pinnell and the Independent Reading Assessment, students are 
struggling to answer the higher order comprehension questions after they are finished reading. We are hiring new 
teachers and reconfiguring grades and need to work on the collaboration of those grades in guiding student talk 
throughout our curriculum. Teachers also requested more inter-visitation between and among grades to aide in their 
professional growth.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of teachers will visit another colleague's classroom one time a month with the focus on reading. 
Teachers will share their observations and questions during scheduled debriefing time.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017 – 2018 Learning Environment Survey demonstrated high confidence in the school’s leadership. 97% of 
teachers say that the principal communicates a clear vision for this school. 100% of teachers who responded said that 
the principal sets high standards for student learning. An area that needs attention is in regards to professional 
development. 84% of teachers wither agreed or strongly agreed that the principal sets clear expectations for teachers 
about implementing what they have learned in professional development. Because we are a growing school, there 
continues to be a need for professional development and consistency of development being shared with both current 
and new staff.  

In 2018 – 2018, we are adding an assistant principal with expertise in special education to our instructional cabinet. 
She will support the instructional cabinet in tracking the progress of third & fourth grade striving readers in order to 
track effectiveness of professional development & inter visitation. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
During the 2018-2019 school year, the instructional cabinet will progress monitor a group of striving third & fourth 
grade readers to track the effectiveness of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 reading interventions that are being implemented.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          31 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Peck Slip School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to 
strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s 
policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of 
the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent 
Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

The Peck Slip School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          33 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help; 

 

 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

The school will further encourage school-level parental involvement by: 

 

● holding an annual Title I Parent Curriculum Conference; 

● hosting educational family events/activities during Parent-Teacher Conferences and throughout the school year; 

● encouraging meaningful parent participation on School Leadership Teams, Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher 
Association) and Title I Parent Committee; 

● supporting or hosting Family Day events; 

● establishing a Parent Resource Center/Area or lending library; instructional materials for parents; 

● encouraging more parents to become trained school volunteers;

children’s progress; 

● developing and distributing a school newsletter or web publication designed to keep parents informed about school 
activities and student progress; 

● providing school planners/folders for regular written communication between teacher and the home in a format, 
and to the extent practicable in the languages that parents can understand. 

 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

The Peck Slip School, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is 
implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between 
the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in activities and programs funded by Title I, 
agree that this Compact outlines how parents, the entire school staff and students will share responsibility for 
improved academic achievement and the means by which a school-parent partnership will be developed to ensure 
that all children achieve State Standards on assessments.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Our assessment tools at Peck Slip include Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment Program, Serravallo Independent 
Reading Assessment, as well as teacher designed assessment tools which enable teachers across grades to develop 
appropriate, differentiated instruction for our students. Periodic assessments throughout the school year enable teachers 
(including ENL, SETTS and AIS teachers) to monitor student progress and adjust instruction to align with each student’s 
ongoing needs.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

The NYSESLAT is administered to all ELL’s.  The data provided by the NYSESLAT scores is reviewed by a team of teachers that 
includes the Principal, ENL teacher, AIS teacher, individual classroom teachers and the Special Education teacher.   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          41 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
In the fall, the ENL team, ENL teacher, AIS teacher and SETTS teacher administer the NYSETELL to all potentially eligible ENL 
students.  Data generated by the NYSETELL determines which students will receive ENL services and at which level.  The data 
from the previous school year’s NYSESLAT provides valuable information that supports placement of current ENL students.  In 
addition, classroom teachers administer the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment to all students in Grade K-
2.  Serravallo Independent Reading Assessment alongside the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark Assessment is administered to 
all students in Grades 3 and 4. Informal periodic assessment in the form of Running Records and teacher designed assessments 
allow us to identify students’ strengths as well as areas of need in order to adjust and differentiate instruction for our ELL’s 
throughout the school year. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

At Peck Slip, all data is reviewed by the Principal, classroom teachers, the ENL teacher, AIS teacher and SETTS teacher.  If the 
data shows that there are ENL students who are well below grade level expectations as readers, those students are referred to 
the AIS teacher for additional support.  Over the course of the year, if a student does not advance in performance, the 
teachers can present those students in a PPT meeting.  These are regularly scheduled meetings providing a team including 
principal, SETTS teacher, ENL teacher, AIS teacher (if needed) as well as other Service Providers.  Based on the teacher’s 
report, the PPT will determine what further interventions could support the child or if the student should be referred for 
broader evaluation. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
For each language learner, who scores below specified levels of performance on the English language proficiency assessment; 
we provide additional services to the student. We take into consideration number of years of instruction in an ENL program, 
English/home language literacy, content area and social/emotional needs of long term ELL’s, results of all proficiency exams, 
recommendations of the ENL  and classroom teacher as well as parent requests.  We also consider whether or not the student 
is a SWD.  Our support services are aligned with the RtI plan already in place at Peck Slip. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
. This tool provides a demographic and academic historical overview of all students.  The data yielded is used to focus on the 
progress toward achievement of proficiency for our ELL’s.  It supports our teachers in designing effective instruction and/or 
intervention for our students.  A review of school demographics which includes a comparison of ELL and non-ELL data, alerts 
us to students who exhibit known risk factors, in Reading, Writing, Listening and Speaking.   This tool allows us to tailor more 
timely and targeted interventions for at-risk students in our ELL population before reaching a more critical level. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

 
The above on-going meetings are used to share assessment and instructional information between all teachers who may 
provide services to individual students in the ENL program. 
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          42 

 

 

regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

ELLs are organized by grade and proficiency levels. Our ENL program goal is to support the integration of ELL students 
into mainstream classrooms; therefore instruction is delivered using standalone and integrated ENL programs. For 
example, the ENL teacher pushes into third, fourth and fifth grade classes with English Language Learners and 
supports the teacher in the classroom. The push-in periods encompass both literacy and math instructional blocks.  In 
addition, we use a standalone model with students to provide one-on-one support so crucial to beginning and low-
intermediate second language learners.  During standalone periods ELLs are clustered by proficiency level spanning 
grades K-5. 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Both our organizational models (push-in and pull-out) and program models (standalone and integrated) are in place to ensure 
that the mandated number of ENL instructional minutes are provided by the fully qualified ENL teacher, to each of our English 
Language Learners based on proficiency levels.  Beginner/Entering and Low Intermediate/Emerging ELL students receive at 
least 360 minutes each week, Intermediate/Transitioning and Advanced/Expanding ELL students receive at least 180 minutes 
each week.  Students at the Proficient/Commanding levels receive 90 minutes of instruction. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
ENL instruction integrates both subject and language learning. We want ELLs to learn concepts and content knowledge while 
learning their second language. The ENL strategies are applied in teaching the four language modalities including listening, 
speaking, reading and writing. While targeting the areas of listening and speaking, the ENL teacher provides the opportunities 
and the environment for interactions between students as well as interactions between teacher and student. During activities 
that require problem solving, students explore the problem in partnerships or triads. Students also practice language skills by 
surveying their classmates, parents, and teachers on a variety of topics integrating mathematics skills as well. Currently, 
teachers are using technology (iPads, phone apps, computer programs) to improve writing skills in addition to scaffolding 
students' speaking and listening skills. In addition, in all classrooms, teachers are asking probing and open-ended questions 
and using less teacher talk to encourage student participation in deeper and more meta-cognitive ways.  Specifically, the K - 2 
reading and writing curricula is integrated and designed to support students in developing oral language. While students are 
aware that they can get ideas from books, poems, songs and each other, they are now exposed to the notion that ideas for 
composing (orally and in writing) can come from the experiences that we have.  Experiences are arranged by teams of teachers 
planning on every grade level in grades K – 2.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Spanish speaking students are assessed using the Spanish LAB in addition to the NYSETELL.  For non-Spanish speaking students, 
we evaluate through their native languages in content areas such as math, social studies, and science.  In addition, over the 
course of the school year, children are evaluated in the following ways: 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          43 

 

d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE: If any SIFE students were to attend Peck Slip School, the ENL teacher together with other trained pedagogues would 
provide the necessary support to them, in the form of personalized instruction to compensate for gaps in foundational 
knowledge.  The ENL teacher has purchased materials specifically designed for such students, for example, to teach basic 
literacy to older students. 
 
Newcomer: Instruction for ENL Newcomer students mainly focuses on basic content to develop literacy skills and on the 
development of interpersonal skills to improve listening and speaking. Second and third year Newcomer ELL students continue 
to develop literacy skills while also developing a deeper familiarity with test formats and test-taking skills. 
 
Developing: Ell students who are still transitioning after having received ENL services for a longer amount of time receive 
additional support.  They are assessed by the ENL teacher to determine any specific issues which are preventing the student 
from performing at a high enough level to exit the program.  Any specific issues are addressed by the ENL teacher who 
communicates with the classroom teacher and at-risk specialists ensure consistency in any interventions.  Our Pupil Personnel 
Team meets once each week to discuss students who may be in need of extra support.  Recommendations are made for RtI 
prior to beginning a full-scale individual evaluation. 
 
Long Term: As a new school, we have not yet encountered Long Term ENL students.  For the future, we will assess and 
evaluate the area/s of need for such students and develop an intervention plan to support greater progress in language 
development. 
 
Former ELL’s:  Former ELL’s receive 90 minutes a week of integrated ENL ELA for up to two years after exiting ELL 
status.  Additionally, the ENL teacher maintains communication with classroom teachers of former ELL students to provide 
suggestions in the event of language related issues.  The classroom teacher alongside the ENL teacher reviews earlier math 
and ELA scores to target areas where academic language support is still needed.  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
At Peck Slip School we ensure that all ELL – SWD are receiving mandated services as required by CR-Part 154 and as mandated 
by their individual IEP’s.  Additionally, these teachers work closely with their ENL teacher so that specific modifications 
accommodate language learning goals as well as content acquisition goals.  All teachers encourage ELL-SWD students to 
become conversant in content areas or other topics by building knowledge in their home language and making connections 
based schema with appropriate leveled texts.  Integrated into instruction in all content areas is the use of graphic organizers, 
peer buddy reading, question webs and strategy tools (such as bookmarks and small desk top charts).  Teaching ENL-SWD 
students includes explicit expectations for developing critical thinking, interpretation. And drawing conclusions alongside a lot 
of practice to ensure skill development.  Teaching students to question while reading helps them understand how to infer 
meaning from a text.  This is achieved through modeling and practice.  
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Students spend time in language rich environments in which they observe, touch, listen, talk and interact with others.  Early 
reading and writing instruction is informal and playful and based on oral language activities (poetry, storytelling, songs and 
rhymes) which lay the foundation for independent reading and writing.  Our school provides a balanced literacy program that 
teaches skills within the context of meaningful interactions with leveled texts that elicit responses from students about ideas, 
characters and events in small group and/or whole discussions either through turn and talk or student led conversation circles. 
The ENL teacher pushes into the classroom during ELA and other content area study times. While the classroom teacher is 
providing a mini-lesson the ENL teacher is parallel teaching to a small group of students.  During push-in periods the ENL 
teacher will either work with ELL students in a small group or will circulate throughout the classroom depending on content 
and individual needs of the students.  The ENL teacher also provides stand-alone instruction as well with either individual 
students or in small groups. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Based on student needs, our school utilizes Wilson Fundations (K/1), Fountas and Pinnell Leveled Literacy Intervention (which 
includes supports for ELL students) and Great Leaps (to support vocabulary development and fluency).  The ELA intervention at 
Peck Slip is designed as a 30-minute expert tutorial or small group session.  This represents a one-third increase in daily lessons 
and puts appropriately leveled book into the hands of students which they can read at school and at home.  Initially the focus 
is on decoding reading strategies for the emergent, struggling readers.  Word work is an important component of the 
intervention support for our ELL students.  Alongside building de-coding strategies and vocabulary development, teachers 
focus on comprehension strategies which include: 
Teachers and paraprofessionals are trained in Responsive Classroom practices and our crisis team is trained in LSCI (Life Space 
Crisis Intervention).  This training provides a common language across grades for social/emotional expectations, classroom 
routines, school traditions and rituals.  
Teachers also work in small guided math groups in their classrooms.  Further support for ELL students and other students who 
may struggle with math thinking is provided by an intervention teacher who meets with individual or small groups of 
students.  This support is provided as both push-in and pull-out as needed.  The support provided in these small groups review 
daily math concepts from our Context for Learning (math in the City) and TERC investigations units of study. 
 
All intervention services are conducted in English.  To date we have not had any special requests for translation but our 
teaching staff includes many bi-lingual teachers in some of the languages spoken by children in our school, (i.e. Russian, 
Spanish, French, Greek). 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Our school will explore Tier II RtI programs such as Reading Rescue to supplement our existing RtI tools.  We will expand 
implementation of across grades Reading buddies where 4th and 5th graders will be paired with classes in the lower grades to 
read, write and talk together. 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ENL students have equal access to all programs provided and offered in our school building.  There are no limitations on 
participation in school activities imposed on our ENL students.  Children participate in Chorus and band programs (enrichment 
activities), as well as all school trips, concerts, and events, (i.e. Spirit Week, Content study celebrations, Holloween Parade, 
neighborhood walks, summer birthday celebrations, PTA sponsored grade level “Mixers.” 
Our school collaborates with the Manhattan Youth After-school Program.  Many of our ENL students are participants in this 
program. At the beginning of the year a table is set up in the lobby of our school.  Parents can access printed information 
about the program.  Flyers are backpacked to all families and the Director of the program offers an informational session for 
families. The Parent Coordinator is readily available to answer any questions regarding enrollment and to seek translators as 
needed for parents of ENL students. The After-school program provides a variety of recreational, athletic, creative and 
academic classes and activities that broaden children’s world experiences and language experiences.  Classes are relatively 
small ensuring that ENL students benefit from the support of counselors and specialty teachers. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Lap-tops, iPads, and Smart Boards with Elmos are fast becoming an integral part of all instruction iat the Peck Slip School.  The 
students in the upper grades have access to our media cart of 30 lap tops to support independent work.  ENL students have 
equal access to these tools and can use Google translate to ensure comprehension and to convey their own thinking as 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          45 

 

needed.  Access to media programming that ensures multi-sensory learning opportunities include Dream Box, Nat Geo , 
Discovery Kids and other programs. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Students literacy skills are easily transferred from a first to a second language, therefore we encourage the use of ENL 
student’s native language in our program.  This builds a connection between home and school and enhances second language 
acquisition by making content comprehensible. 
Home Language support is delivered through use of: 
All of the above serves to strengthen children’s skills with their home languages, therefore providing a strong foundation for 
second language learning.  Children who are literate in their home languages, are better able to become literate in their 
second language. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

.  The ENL service provider maintains a library of age appropriate and level appropriate books for their students.  This library is 
supplemented by classroom libraries which also contain the same.  All ENL instruction corresponds to the age and grade level 
of the students. ELL students are grouped according to grade and proficiency level.  All resources are chosen based on 
individual needs and skill levels.  Additionally, the ENL teacher meets with the classroom teacher of each student and receives 
an outline in core content areas of math and literacy as well as content studies.  This outline includes a list of resources such as 
texts, rubrics and student work. The ENL teacher is able to work with the classroom teacher to provide the necessary 
instruction and assessments to develop the important skills for all ages and proficiency levels.  The ENL teacher undertakes 
professional development on a regular basis to ensure that her content and pedagogical knowledge is current.  Given the wide 
range of developmental needs of our students it is necessary for the service providers to conduct informal assessments on an 
ongoing basis.  This allows the teacher to flexibly design meaningful and appropriate instruction for all ENL students. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our school is temporarily providing one floor to a NYS DOE UPK program.  The presence of this school on the 4th floor has not 
had any impact on how resources are shared between both schools. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Most newly enrolled ENL students are Kindergartners. Parents attend an orientation at the beginning of the school 
year.  Parents are informed of all three ENL program models at the parent orientation and are provided with a Parent Survey & 
Program Selection Form (in the parents’ preferred language), where parents can indicate their program choice.  If a parent 
chooses an option that is not currently available in the school, the school will support the family in arranging a transfer for the 
student to a different school where the parent’s selection is currently available. 
Other school information disseminated to families upon enrollment includes a preview of our school’s curriculum and 
instruction, and parent engagement opportunities by the Parent Coordinator.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

N/A 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Every teacher on staff at Peck Slip School is involved in Professional Development training and study groups every Tuesday 
afternoon from 2:40 – 4:00 PM.  Additionally, teachers attend Grade Teams meet weekly as they continue to refine our 
school’s curriculum.  In these team meetings teachers also look at student work to inform instruction and set goals for all 
students.   ENL teachers are involved in the planning of PD to ensure that our school meets the language learners’ linguistic 
and academic needs. 
 
Our ENL teacher has participated in workshops provided by the NYC DOE, UFT, NYU and Columbia University.  She has also 
attended city-wide conferences and turn-keys linguistic and cultural information to facilitate learning and to build cross-
cultural understanding.  Our ENL teacher continues to read ancillary materials and continue to share resources with other 
teachers.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
At Peck Slip a minimum of the required 15% of all PD hours has prescribed by CR Part 154.2 are dedicated to language 
acquisition.  This includes a focus on best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content instruction 
for ENL students. The Principal maintains a file of PD, Grade Team meetings, and other professional activity attendance and 
agendas. 
 
Fifty percent of our ENL teacher’s Professional Development is dedicated to developing best practices in delivery of ENL 
instruction and services. 
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
. Our Parent Coordinator ensures that all families are aware of opportunities often provided by the NYC DOE for parental 
involvement in their children’s language learning.  In her weekly newsletters, our Parent Coordinator informs parents of 
conferences and events designed for families of ENL students.  She also provides translated versions of school and DOE 
notifications in families’ preferred language as well as translated versions of the Peck Slip Parent Handbook.  She provides 
translators for parents during parent teacher conferences when requested.   Through our Parent Coordinator’s newsletters all 
families are invited and included in scheduled events which include the District 2 Art Show, Taste of the Seaport, South Street 
Seaport Tree Lighting and other school and community events.  These invitations and notifications allow ENL students’ parents 
to develop relationships with other families and broadens their participation as members of the Peck Slip community. 
 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

. Parent involvement in our school includes:

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Maggie Siena, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,  
interpretation, compliance and budget.  
 

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

Every parent fills out the Home Language Identification Survey. Parents also provide information about 
themselves and their children through a classroom survey provided by each child's teacher and collected by class. 
Our school will also utilize any relevant information provided to us on the Blue cards. We analyze the Parent 
Survey to determine if translator or translations are necessary or requested and provide them accordingly 
through our Parent Coordinator. We also review ATS reports If parents are unable to understand English we 
provide the HLIS form for them to complete in their native language. The findings are shared at a PTA meeting. If a 
parent idenifies English as their second language, we will provide the appropriate documents for them to 
complete in their native language.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

To date, though we do 
have designated ELL's at 
Peck Slip School and ours 
is a culturally diverse 
community with many bi-
lingual families, almost all 
of our ELL parents have 
listed English as their 
preferred language of 
communication, both 
written and spoken, with 
our school. In this 2016- 
2017 school year, we 
have had one parental 
requests for translations, 
translators or 
provisioning of 
school/DOE documents in 
parents native language.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of a school emergency, we will either utilize our bilingual (Russian, Chinese, Spanish, French) staff 
members to reach limited English proficient families or the over-the-phone interpretation services described above. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Our school ensures that limited English speaking families are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate in 
and have access to programs and services critical to their child's education by establishing the following: 

 

1. The principal designates a language access coordinator who requests and maintains related documents, certifies 
eligibility for translations/interpretations, and ensures the provision of appropriate services for limited English 
speaking parents. 

2. The school has developed a language access plan which is aligned with the DOE Language Access Policy 

3. The school translates important documents to share with limited English speaking families

4. The ENL teacher receives professional development related, in part, to the Chancellor's Regulations A-663. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Non-English speaking families are provided with the Bill of Parent Rights and Responsibilities and with the meaningful 
opportunity to participate in and have access to all activities and services. At PS 343 the translation and interpretation 
services are provided to all parents who need language assistance. Our community has staff and parents who speak 
both English and a second language and are eager to assist. Translation has been provided for all required documents 
including registration and enrollment forms, special education and related services, transfers, Discipline Code, school-
based progress reports, and any other documents that contain individual student-specific or school policy 
information. 

Additionally, oral interpretation services are available during all school meetings/activities. 

Budget allocations are scheduled to support both written and oral interpretation services. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The feedback from the families is gathered through the Parent Surveys that was implemented by our Parent 
coordinator.
