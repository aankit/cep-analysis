Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the School Comprehensive Educational Plan  

The School Comprehensive Educational Plan (SCEP) is a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to support 
schools in engaging their staff, parents, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing school needs, 
setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, monitoring 
progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community.  

The process of developing and implementing the SCEP is aligned to the Framework for Great Schools. This section will 
provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding SCEP development aligned with the school’s state 
accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, Strong 
Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department has established programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students supports to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of schools 
centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, school 
leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that all students succeed. 
Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New Approach to 
Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and SCEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The School Comprehensive Educational 
Plan (SCEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint for continuous 
improvement that engages a school community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis 
of student needs to identify and address root causes and implement activities and strategies 
that improve outcomes for students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to increase 
student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the Framework 
for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community members 
concrete ways to improve. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           7 

 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five (5) goals and action plans that align with 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 
Accountability Tools and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is informed by the New York State Education Department’s (NYSED) Diagnostic Tool for 
School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) Tenets,  the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Rubric, School Quality Guide and other 
quantitative and qualitative data tools. 
 
NYSED’s Six DTSDE Tenets 

To strengthen the existing system, the NYSED has developed a tool that captures the best practices from each of the 
current tools called the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness. This new tool encompasses multiple 
instruments such as interviews, classroom observations and surveys. The protocol will begin with a clear and cogent 
statement of the optimal conditions of an effective school and the instruments comprising the protocol will measure 
how close or far away a particular school is to the optimal conditions identified. Once reviewed, the school and district 
will create a strategic plan to address the areas in need of improvement. All current Priority and Focus Schools and Focus 
Districts must use the tool; districts that are required to submit District Comprehensive Improvement Plans and 
Comprehensive Educational Plans also will use the tool.  
 
The DTSDE protocol includes a rubric, which identifies clear and coherent expectations of the optimal conditions of an 
effective school and school district across the following six tenets: 

  Tenet 1: District Leadership and Capacity 
  Tenet 2: School Leader Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 3: Curriculum Development and Support 
  Tenet 4: Teacher Practices and Decisions 
  Tenet 5: Student Social and Emotional Developmental Health, and 
  Tenet 6: Family and Community Engagement

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
2017-18 Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  
Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 

I. 
II.  School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III.  Structures for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 
Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

 
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 
Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the SCEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 
1% parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the SCEP. For additional guidance 
on establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 
 
Next Steps for SCEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           9 

 

  Step 3: In Part 1A of the Section 5: Needs Assessment indicate the Statement of Practice (SOP) from the DTSDE 

Tenets that will be addressed in the action plan. Schools that received an Integrated Intervention Team (IIT) 
School Review should use the recommendations from the review to select their SOPs. Schools that did not 
undergo an IIT review should select SOPs informed by the major findings/recommendations from your most 
recent Quality Review (QR) or Central-led Review (CLR), and other qualitative and quantitative data. 

  Step 4: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 
by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are SMART 
– Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 5: Build consensus around activities, strategies and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 6: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 7: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

 
Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Section 4: SCEP Overview 

 

School Vision Statement: 

Our school vision is to promote an inclusive learning environment that supports and celebrates the growth and 
progress of the whole child within a diverse community.  

 

School Mission Statement: 

We will achieve our mission through implementing a rigorous Common- Core aligned curriculum to meet the needs of 
our diverse learners. Our Pre-K to grade 5 students will achieve success through the implementation of the workshop 
model, academic streaming, and quality questioning and discussion techniques. We will support our students through 
after-school programs, one-to-one tutoring, extensive partnerships with outside agencies, as well as varied health 
services in a schoolbuilding that is fully accessible to all. The school, home, and community will work as a team to 
ensure that each child is working to his/her full potential both cognitively and socially now and in the future. 

 

Theory of Action: 

If school leaders provide professional learning opportunities and engage in cycles of observations that focus on 
engaging in authentic fluid discussions targeting reading comprehension strategies that build proficiency around 
grade level texts or above, then teachers will be able to identify student reading comprehension needs through their 
analysis of assessment data to design tasks and lessons that incorporate reading skills with discussions about texts. 

Instructional Focus:For pedagogical staff to increase their academic rigor in their teaching practices through the use 
of higher order thinking questioning and fluid student to student discussions that will help to improve their ability to 
comprehend text (i.e. identifying and understanding the key details in a text) thus increasing student achievement in 
reading and writing. 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

According to New York City Department of Education Statistics dated from 06/26/18, P.S. 146’s student population 
(total 356) consists of 21% ELL’s, 40% SWD’s & 96.4% free lunch eligible. 66% of students are Hispanic, 24% Black, 6% 
Asian and 4% White/Other. Males account for 50.84% of the student population enrolled and 49.15% are female 
students enrolled.  

The average attendance rate for the 2017-2018 school year was 91%. 

 

We are a school community that collaborates to provide support to our families and students. We continue to 
maintain strong partnerships with the community to both support and enrich the families and students at P.S. 146. 
Some of our partnerships planned for the 2018-2019 SY are:

Our school staff, Parent-Association, and students are very committed to making P.S. 146 community very warm and 
inviting. Our active Parent-Association provides physical and financial support, as well as programs that help to 
enhance our school environment. The Parent-Association’s involvement at our school shows the school community 
and especially our students our students the importance of their school and the strong community ties that connect 
the home to school. The Parent-Association support school-wide events to promote this strong partnership. 

 

Our staff and administrators hold themselves accountable to the growth and progress of our students learning. The 
teachers work together to share ideas and support and encourage each other. Intervisitions are used to provide staff 
with additional support in professional learning and collaboration. The staff support their students and look to further 
develop their teaching craft to support their colleagues. 

We also have a strong partnership with our co-located school, P169. Students with severe disabilities are integrated 
to school events, field trips as well. We have professional development opportunities together that share resources. 
We are planning to expand these opportunities for our combined staff members next year. Also, we are planning to 
integrate students with severe disabilities into instructional programs if appropriate.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

P.S. 146 is a school committed to the progress & growth of our students. We have over 21% of our student population 
that resides in temporary housing which causes a transient student population throughout our school year. Families 
at our school receive a tremendous amount of support from our large staff as well as our community based 
organizations, partnerships and collaborations. We accept all students into our school who demonstrate various 
ability levels and extensive needs based on external factors.  

 

P.S. 146 also has a range of students with varying disabilities and provides programs that address these needs. We are 
a fully barrier-free school and have students that have medical issues, physical issues as well as requiring an elevator 
and ramps at our school.

P.S. 146 has made many strides in student growth and meeting grade level benchmark reading levels. P.S. 146 has 
improved in this area and continues to do so. Our school goals and instructional focus for the 2018-2019 school year, 
will continue to emphasize our drive to increase our students’ levels of proficiency in reading, writing and math. We 
are further working on integrating other content areas (Science and Social Studies) into our reading and writing blocks 
as well. We are continuing our work on incorporating higher order thinking into instruction to further develop student 
to student discussions which has been a challenge. Also, P.S. 146 is working to further develop our teacher capacity 
and provide engaging and rigorous instruction in Literacy and Math.  

 

We will continue to work with Teachers College consultants (grades K-2, 3-5) and the Math Consultant for the 2018-
2019 SY to assist us in these areas of instruction. School data as well as state data has indicated that all grades and 
classes have increased in student achievement. 2017-2018 state-wide data results are pending.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Rigorous Instruction. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1b, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 80% of pedagogical staff will increase their academic rigor in teaching practices through the use of higher 
order thinking questioning and fluid student to student discussions that rely on use of relevant text evidence that will 
lead to improvement in comprehension. As a result of teachers’ practice, by June 2019, 80% of students will increase 
their abilities to discuss a grade level or higher text by asking and answering higher order questions through discussions. 
This improvement in comprehension will be measured and driven by Measure of Teacher Practice (MOTP) and 
comprehension reading data.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
When determining staff assignments the following factors are looked at: experience in the grade, experience with the 
student population, licensing restrictions, compatibility with co-teacher if considered for an ICT class. Also, looked at 
student data to determine progress students made in the class with the teacher the prior school year. Level of 
teaching competencies is another factor when determining staff assignments.  

 

A collaborative on-going relationship with Hunter College places teacher candidates in our school for internships & 
student teaching. This gives us the opportunity to screen qualified candidates in the classroom setting to determine if 
they meet standards for classroom teaching positions.  

Using New Teacher Finder we search for eligible candidates to screen, interview & conduct demo lessons. 

To retain new teachers on staff we match them with mentor teachers (i.e. veteran teachers, school -based coach to 
provide guidance & support.) 

Teacher teams work collaboratively to study student work & share best practices. Intervisitations will take place 
focusing on the CCLS & Capacity Framework. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the strategies and activities for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, staff, and 
paraprofessionals that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  

  Differentiated professional development sessions will be provided to allow teachers to set measurable goals 

for their professional growth.  

  Teachers will be offered & encouraged to attend off-site professional develop opportunities through various 

resources (i.e. DOE, MFSC, etc.) 

  Pedagogical staff will have the opportunity to attend workshops that they can turn-key to colleagues and 

administrators.

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/information, 
early intervention services, etc.). 

  Open houses will be held for incoming students & their parents. 
  Meetings are conducted with students residing in temporary housing.  
  CSE reviews for transitioning & turning 5 students are held for parents.  
  Mandated services are put in place for all incoming students with IEPs.  
  Curriculum Night (Back to School) held in the Fall for parents. 
 

Family Fridays (once a month) allow for parent involvement in all classrooms. 

 

Alignment of curricula between Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten includes a focus on phonological awareness and 
reading comprehension. For example, the CROWD technique will be used during read alouds by both grades to 
support the development of oral language, vocabulary and reading comprehension. In addition, the Pre-K math 
curriculum, Building Blocks, will support students' understanding of math concepts including number sense, counting 
and cardinality needed for the K-5 "A Story of Units" Math Curriculum. Kindergarten teachers review the Pre-K unit 
plans to consider opportunities to build on the students' prior knowledge within the current units when creating the 
Year at a Glance Curriculum Maps. Also, in June 2016 teachers in grades K-1 meet to review and align curricula for the 
next Year at a Glance Curriculum Map. 

 

Children and families are given opportunities to attend Open House Sessions throughout the Pre-Kindergarten and 
Kindergarten enrollment windows. Parent welcome sessions are held in September for all new families. Monthly 
Family Fridays, weekly Parent Engagement, and ongoing community field trips provide parents additional 
opportunities to participate in the classroom and learning experiences of the students.

to review. Students' special education needs mandated in an Individualized Education Plan are shared via SESIS and at 
bi-monthly Student Intervention Team meetings, as necessary.  

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    

  Grade meetings are held with teachers, school based coach/data team & administration to analyze student 

data & plan for informal & formal assessments.  

  On-going differentiated professional development will be provided focusing on assessment tools being 

utilized for monitoring student progress. 

  A survey will be given to staff to determine on-going effectiveness of the professional development

In addition to the Work Sampling System, Pre-K teachers select mid-unit tasks for formative assessment and 
use the Pre-K Explore culminating tasks for summative assessment.  

  Professional development is designed from an analysis of the data. For example, the 2016-2017 instructional 

focus will be from the Pre-K Quality Standard 

 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds enables, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its 
Schoolwide plan (SCEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program 
contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, 
State, and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the 
amount each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met 
the intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I School Improvement 1003(a): To support implementation of school improvement activities identified 

through the Diagnostic Tool for School and District Effectiveness (DTSDE) reviews or a school review with 
district oversight and included in the DCIP/SCEP.  

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: To support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to improve instruction and address the identified needs.  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           61 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant: Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Parent Engagement Set-aside: Additional set-aside is to enable greater and 

 

more meaningful parent participation in the education of their children. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process, including Title I 1003(g) SIG funds: These funds must be 

used for the purposes specified by the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. Anna M. Short School, 04M146, in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children.Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

Anna M. Short School, 04M146 will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           63 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

Our school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent 
Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

Encouraging School-Level Parental Involvement 

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the 
proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input. To increase and 
improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           64 

 

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before October 30th of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act.; 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

Rationale: This after school program is going to supplement the continued growth of academic 
English and to hone skills in all of the language modalities. The students in this program will be 
able to improve reading, writing, and presentation skills. There will be teacher and peer feedback 
from classroom performance, and classroom presentation of speaking, reading, and writing. 
 
The program, "The World Newscast",  is inquiry based as students learn to create relevant 
questions and respond with relevant answers (enhancing essay writing and speaking skills) in 
order to find out about world cultures. Students will research various topics about the world on 
iPads.  After researching, students will write interview questions and share their 
research.  Throughout the program students will videotape their interview and each others; 
interviews and create a newsroom about their findings utilizing their strengths and interests. The 
students will be able to find their interests and strengths within the different aspects of a 
newsroom.  Students will turn into cameramen, photographers, behind the scenes broadcast 
reporters, set designers, and anchor persons. 
 
 
Subgroups and Grade Levels: The program will service grades 3-5. The 5th Grade program will 
be for Transitional to Expanding students focusing on building research and presentation skills 
for middle school. The 3rd and 4th Grade program will be for newcomers with 0-3 years in the 
country and also for other students who remain at the Entering and Emerging levels. 
 
 
Schedule and Duration: The program will run twice a week from 2:20 to 4:00, for 20 weeks. 
 
 
Language and Instruction will be in English. 
 
 
Number and Type of Teachers: There will be 2 ESL trained teachers and 1 common branch 
special education teacher. 
Types of Materials: The materials used in this program will be from throughout the building. 
Students will use iPads for their research and videotaping, TC graphic organziers and paper, 
various anchor charts and supports from the Heinemann website used with TC. Subscriptions 
will be used with other school funding.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Rationale: It is so important that schools have programs to bring in ELL parents.  This 
programming helps to bridge the home and the school and can create more successful learning 
experiences for students.  It can also help to make ELL parents more comfortable within the 
child's school setting.  Many times ELL parents have some hesitation with being involved with 
the school community to language and cultural differences. 
Schedule and Duration: There will be a minimum of monthly programs at the school.  This will 
begin in September and run until June. 
Topics to be Covered: The topics to be covered will be the following; how to be involved in your 
child's education, getting ready for the standardized tests, understanding what an IEPs, the 
curriculum for the school year at the beginning and the expectations for the next grade near the 
end of the year, Coffee and Tea with the Principal and Assistant Principal and finding the right 
middle school.  Im addition parents will have a needs assessment with the parent 
coordinator.  Through this needs assessment we will plan more activities specific to the parents' 
needs.  Additionally the parents will participate in the Title III after school program.  They will 
be involved in the newsroom scenery design and will also be involved in the students' inquiry 
process by providing workshops that are teaching about their cultures (through cooking, art 
projects, and oral presentations as some examples). There are also monthly Family Fridays 
where parents are invited into their children's classrooms to do a parent/child learning activity. 
Name of Providers: The people providing the workshops will be: Diana Alava, the Parent 
Coordinator, the administration, Dr. Silfen and Ms. LLull, the bilingual ESL Teacher, Ms. Levin 
and the classroom teachers. 
Parent Notification: With any parent activities there will be interpretation and translation 
services.  Parents will be notified through personal invitations when they are physically in the 
building (in the morning and afternoon for drop off  and pick up).  Additionally there will be 
translated flyers sent home and the parents will also receive phone calls to encourage 
participation.  There will also be flyers and large signs posted in highly visible areas around the 
school such as by the security desk, the front door and in the auditorium and gym (places for 
drop off and dismissal).

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 PS 146 uses Fountas and Pinnell to assess early literacy skills of ELLs.  The school uses this data to place students in guided 
reading groups and also to determine student's eligibility for Response to Intervention (RTI) programs.  The data shows that 
ELLs are behind their peers in regards to reading levels and language skills.  Our school's instructional plan places ELLs as a 
targeted subgroup. Classroom teachers initially analyze the data and it shared with the staff on a Google Drive so all staff can 
access it.  The ENL Teacher looks specifically at the strengths and weaknesses that the data shows and then decides what 
topics will be useful for reading comprehension with ENL students in a professional development session. Most of this 
struggle in the lower grades is due to understanding early reading strategies, but not having sufficient vocabulary.  In the 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           76 

 

upper grades, much of the issue lies with grammatical structures such as suffixes and also higher level content vocabulary.  In 
addition teachers use assessments that are part of their literacy program.   The school uses Teachers' College and gives 
baseline and end line assessments for this literacy program as well. Additionally for writing, the students are given on demand 
writing prompts in order to gauge where the focus needs to be for instruction.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

One ENL Teacher is part of The 4th Grade Teacher Team Inquiry Meetings.  The 4th Grade  teacher team utilizes the ENL 
Teacher to focus on ELLs as a subgroup throughout the year with the whole Inquiry cycle and select other grades depending on 
the data,  also discusses ELLs as a target population in their Inquiry / Teacher Team meetings and access information from the 
ENL Teacher as needed.  All assessment data is uploaded on to Google Drive so that all staff can access the data at any 
time.  This makes it easy for the ENL teacher to check in on the ELLs and how they are faring in their classroom settings and 
bridges collaboration and common planning goals in response to the data results.  The other ENL Teacher works with the 
Kindergarten and 1st Grade teams sharing planning and differentiation techniques.  Additionally ELL data that is applicable is 
also uploaded and accessible for all staff to see.  The classroom teachers do the initial data analysis.  They input the results of 
the assessments on a Google Doc and all staff can access it.  As the school year progresses, the staff works with analyzing Math 
data also with the guidance of a consultant from NTM.  Additionally, Guided Reading levels are due monthly and there are also 
three times a year (September, February, May) where students are assessed in a more in depth way in order to get a 
benchmark for gains and needed focus strategies for the upcoming months.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
The school uses the state exams and summative school-wide data to determine the success of the ELL program.  Scores for the 
NYSESLAT, ELA, Math and Science are analyzed and growth is measured.  Progress on the NYSESLAT is measured to see if the 
school met the required expected gains.  Progress is also monitored using informal assessment data on a monthly basis in 
Reading, Writing, and Math. Results of these assessments are used to inform instruction and share strategies of best practice 
across grade level teams.  Grades 2-5 use RALLY Education Rehearsal Plus for Math and ELA as interim assessments The main 
math assessments are from the Engage New York Math program during the school year. The school also uses a Pre and Post 
Math MOSL for all grades. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Once the data is analyzed, students are put into Guided Reading groups according to their reading levels. The classroom 
teachers do the assessing so they analyze the data and submit a document on Google Docs with the reading levels that all 
teachers can view.  Having this data accessible to all is necessary because it allows all related service providers to access the 
information.  In addition, since the students from all grades stream to other classrooms that are teaching like reading levels in 
guided reading groups, all teachers access this data and review it looking at who ranked higher in the level and who ranked 
lower in the level and then they organize their groups. Those students are then given specific intervention related to their 
decoding needs.  At times they are pulled out during Guided Reading time for a double dose of Blast or Boost and  at times 
they stay within their assigned guided reading groups in order to apply the work that is done on decoding as an 
intervention.  Some ELL students are assigned to have Guided Reading with an ENL Teacher so they can have additional guided 
language support in reading. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
PS 146 uses Fountas and Pinnell as a Universal Screener for RTI. Based on the results students performing below grade level 
will be screened using DIBELS as a diagnostic assessment.  Guided reading further reinforces concepts at students' 
instructional reading level.  In addition to Tier 1 supports, working within the resources of the school, general education 
students in grades K-2 are targeted for the first round of Tier 2 RTI support services. ELLs within this subgroup are provided 
support in Phonemic Awareness, Phonics, and Fluency.  The Tier 2 interventions support small group instruction that address 
gaps in reading skills. Progress is monitored using the programs for Phonemic Awareness, Phonics and Fluency. Monthly 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           77 

 

 

informal running records  assess students' application of the skills to their instructional reading levels and assess 
comprehension.  Additionally student progress in writing is then  monitored utilizing the baseline and end line assessments for 
the writing program.  Students who need additional support in writing also be able to receive these services. 
 
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Of the 67 students identified as ELLs one of the assessments that is utilized to evaluate and inform ELL programming are the 
levels that students achieve on the NYSESLAT.  Scores are analyzed to see whether students remained at the same proficiency 
level, decreased by a level or more, and students who made gains of two or more proficiency levels.  Trends in students in 
Grades 3-5 who make gains in Math and ELA are also tracked. Best practices are shared by the teachers whose data shows 
success with ELLs.  For the lower grades, students are assessed with Fountas and Pinell, (Grades 3-5 use this also as part of 
their evaluation of data).  Results of monthly Guided Reading levels are also utilized for all grades to check on students' 
reading progress.  For math the school uses pre assessment in a Math performance task in September / October and a post 
assessment in May/June.  The results from the prior school year are the initial data used to analyze and plan. Our data 
suggests that Language Proficiency overall is increasing for our student population when we analyze the NYSESLAT trends but 
we are going to look more closely at th students who remain at the same level on the NYSESLAT for more than two year so we 
can structure staff development and planning.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

The EDAT tool is used to look at the specific ELL data and students' overall picture of their academic journey The data from the 
EDAT is immediately shared with the ENL teachers.  The teachers analyze the data, specifically looking at students who made 
gains and who dropped in proficiency levels.  Determining factors that attribute to the success of the ELL students who made 
gains, and the lack of success with the students who went down in proficiency levels, are considered. One key factor is looking 
at trends of the classroom teachers who had these populations of students in their classes and their history of success with 
the ELLs over time (2 or more years).  Best practices of these teachers are looked at and shared at school-wide professional 
development sessions, and at Inquiry / Teacher Team meetings.  In addition professional development sessions provided by 
the on site ENL teacher.  The first session always revolves around looking at ELL data, what the NYSESLAT entails, and how we 
can work together as a staff to foster success in the students based on the NYSESLAT data analysis and familiarity with the way 
the test is formatted. The teachers record their trends and an action plan is made by the end of the training.  The recorded 
information at times will be integrated into teacher team meetings and other professional development sessions.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Integrated and Standalone ENL are implemented based on the number of mandated minutes for each proficiency 
level of the NYSESLAT / NYSITELL. Levels that include flexibility have been included in the integrated service minutes 
for all grade levels. During integrated services, students are heterogeneously grouped based on grade level. However, 
differentiation within the integrated service classroom supports the mixed proficiency levels of students. For example, 
during Reading students work in small groups based on their reading level. Other co-teaching approaches, such as 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           78 

 

 

parallel teaching, station teaching and alternative teaching are also used in the integrated service program to support 
the mixed proficiency of ELL and non-ELL students within the content areas.  There are strategic language 
partnerships in place for Reading and Writing to support language acquisition and comprehension of the academic 
language in the reading and writing tasks. 
 
Standalone ENL services are provided based on students' grade level whenever it is possible.  At times there are mixed 
grade groups with students in similar grades but only with two contiguous grades, such as a 1/2 group and a new 
arrivals group for either Grades 3/4 or 4/5 depending on where the numbers are.  Currently, Standalone includes one 
upper grade group with all 4th Graders, one K group, and a bridge group of Grades 1 and 2.  Students are 
heterogeneously grouped based on proficiency levels.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

         a.   Based on students NYSESLAT scores, students are given a proficiency level of: Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, 
Expanding, or Commanding.  At PS 146, students who scored Entering are receiving 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 
minutes of integrated ELA.  Students who scored Emerging are receiving 180 minutes of standalone ENL and 180 minutes of 
integrated ELA.  Students who scored Transitioning are receiving 180 minutes of integrated ELA.  Students who scored 
Expanding are receiving 180 minutes of integrated ELA or another content area.  When it is possible (more ENL staff) the 
school also schedules certain students from the Transitioning level for additional standalone using the flexible schedule option, 
over Integrated if this better suits their language and learning needs. Students that scored Commanding are receiving 90 
minutes of integrated services.     
 
The ENL Teacher works within the students' classrooms for all grades and groups in the Integrated Model.  The ENL Teacher 
provides scaffolds that are used with the ENL students such as language frames and additional visuals which students keep in 
their resources folder.  The ENL Teacher schedules to be in classes for blocks of time during Literacy instruction and works with 
the students in small groups.  The students are part of the mini-lessons in literacy with the whole class and are guided using 
graphic organizers or additional prompts during the partner talk time (Turn and Talks).  Students are then moved into station 
work or small group work that targets the big themes for the unit.  All teachers in the classroom also have reading and writing 
conferences with the ELLs so they can see where they fare with grade level content and plan appropriate language based 
scaffolds to move the students up. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   In the ENL program at P.S. 146 all lessons will begin to be aligned to standards that match the grade level expectations  of the 
students.  Integrated ENL takes place in the classroom using a co-teaching model and a division of grouping during small group 
work that addresses specific support for the literacy and math units of study . For the Spanish speakers and French speakers, 
there is a partial focus on cognates for some of the small group work.  
 
 Both the content area and ENL teacher deliver content, with the ENL teacher focusing on the language students need to make 
content comprehensible and to foster language development.  Methods such as partner work are used to foster language with 
partners who are English proficient, 
 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           79 

 

The ENL students receive additional support during the Teachers' College Reading and Writing mini-lessons.  Graphic 
organizers are designed to help the students follow the sequence of the lesson.  Additionally teachers sit with focus students 
to help drive their talk during the Turn and Talk times. Strategic partnerships appropriate for language development are 
created. Conferencing is also used when students are working independently so teachers can see what additional support the 
ELLs need in content and in expressive and receptive vocabulary related to the content.   There is also station work at times.   
 
Standalone ENL classes are also aligned to Standards  Chants, songs, and poems with target academic language are materials 
used to highlight key language, help students be exposed to it in an engaging way, and also to help develop English language 
fluency.  Graphic organizers, shared reading, shared writing, interactive writing (for Grades K-2) and Language Experience 
Approach are applied to help scaffold higher level academic concepts.  Additionally the RBERN bilingual glossaries are used for 
Grades 3-5 for ELA and Math for students who are literate in their native languages.  There are currently Spanish, Arabic, 
Chinese  and French speakers in the ENL program and these languages have available glossaries.  For other languages not 
translated, the school will use the Language Interpretation and Translation Unit with the NYCDOE.  The school also provides 
picture dictionaries and word by word translations in the languages the students speak (French, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic). 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   When students are first identified as ELLs Spanish speakers are testing using the Spanish LAB exam to identify their first 
language skills.  For newcomer ELLs who speak Spanish, qualified staff work with the students in order to facilitate leaning 
grade level content and it is used as applicable and when possible to assess understanding of content orally and written, where 
possible.  As students learn to decode and read, comprehension questions are often asked in the first language to check for 
student understanding. Teachers design the questions and for the Spanish speaking students, there are Spanish speaking 
para professionals that work one to one with the students and see how the students fare with native language tasks.  The ENL 
Teacher is fluent in Spanish and can check the students' work.  Also, it is possible to tell immediately through the Spanish LAB 
test results, whether the Spanish speaking students have literacy skills in Spanish.  For French speaking students, the A.P.E. 
teacher is fluent in French and assists with assessing academic concepts in French.    The students usually are and they easily 
transfer their native language literacy over to English and quickly begin to be competent in English tasks and seem to prefer 
that.  We have found that our Spanish speaking population and our Arabic speakers do not have literacy skills in their native 
language.  They prefer English assessments and with time, this is facilitated.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

a. 
Students who have been identified as SIFE  receive response to intervention services as well as extra minutes of ENL where 
possible.  They also receive tutoring from the a community based organization that has a partnership with the school called 
Union Settlement tutors that we have in our school.  Interns / Student teachers also work closely with the students in addition 
to certain paraprofessionals that are trained by the ENL Teacher and given resources to work on with the 
students.  Additionally the students stream for Phonics into classrooms that are designated in the morning block to utilize the 
specific phonics programs of  Blast and Boost. This program helps the students with the specific sounds for reading and writing 
the English language using phonemic awareness strategies and manipulatives.  During Guided Reading time, students are also 
streamed to classes as the rest of the school streams also, into appropriate groups for their reading and language levels.  Many 
are only between Levels A-D, which on Fountas and Pinell, ranks as on Kindergarten level.  There are certain designated 
teachers who work with this level. 
 
b. 
Newcomer ELLs are grouped during ENL services to focus on the language skills necessary to succeed in school.  The curriculum 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           80 

 

is integrated with all disciplines and theme based in order to facilitate frequent exposure and re exposure to relevant  topics 
and  academic language that can transfer across all subject areas.  Much of the focus is on speaking and listening with shared 
writing products.  There are also many charts with specific language, a lot of visual support, vocabulary routines, and strategies 
instruction as appropriate.  Students have this type of integrated and highly scaffolded instruction and as they progress, less 
scaffolds are needed and students are trained on working towards independence and knowing what resources to use to help 
them have some concrete language to guide them in their folders.   
 
c, d 
ENL for developing and long-term are differentiated to focus on literacy skills.  Our data shows the students who are in danger 
of becoming long term ELLs due to lack of movement on the NYSESLAT.  These students have scored at the Expanding level  for 
at least two or three consecutive years.  The ENL Teacher works with the students on reading and writing strategies that 
correlate to the Teachers' College reading and writing units of study.  Students receive instruction with help understanding the 
big themes within the reading and writing.  There are in depth discussions and activities to help students activate their prior 
knowledge and receive additional language once the gaps in knowledge are realized through the discussions and 
conferences.  Focus for small group work on the big themes includes but is not limited to: looking at general versus specific 
information, main idea and details, sentence structure and parts of speech that are relevant and necessary for their reading 
and writing work, especially work with analyzing word parts to help with meaning (base, prefix and suffix work, cognates) 
Students also work with language frames at first and continue to use them as needed.  Those frames are added to using 
students' own formations as time progresses.  Additionally students have assistance with the whole class work that involves 
partner talk (Turn and Talks).  The ENL teacher and the classroom teacher work on strategic partnerships for the students so 
that they can actively participate in the partner talk and acquire and use target language at the same time. 
 
 e. 
Former ELLs are provided with a minimum of 90 minutes per week in ELA or another content area during integrated ENL 
services.   They are given the same language materials as their peers at other levels such as packets with target language, work 
with listening and speaking focus and practice engaging in high level academic conversations.  They choose to use the 
materials if they are helpful for them.  They receive additional resources at times that are less scaffolded such as lists of 
character trait synonyms without pictures to advance the level of language (For example; instead of using sad, students can 
choose gloomy or unhappy).  Students are taught how to use these materials during their 90 minutes.   An additional language 
routine is that the former ELLs also serve as mentors to the current ELLs and practice and apply language, specific to explaining 
academic tasks and teaching content to their peers.  They get practice with expressive language and also are producing almost 
the same products as the students who are not ENL students.  
 
Other Information on Supports for All ENL Students: 
Students at all levels of language also have access to Brain Pop, Nat Geo online, Myon Reading and Lee and Low 
libraries.  These programs all have information that are grade appropriate topics but level appropriate reading material.  RTI 
strategies include a focus on general education ELL students in grades K-2 and utilize parallel materials to assist the students in 
reaching grade level.. The school also works with City Year and 2-3 City Year Staff members are placed in rooms in Grades 3-
5.  They have target students, many of which include the ELLs and they do individual and small group tutoring  with their target 
students and also shadow students in content where the student is struggling in order to make sure the students pay attention 
and ask questions when they need further assistance during the whole class instruction and independent work blocks. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 All ELLs and SWD at P.S. 146 are instructed using grade-level materials.  In ELA teachers in grades K-5  follow Teachers' College 
Literacy program. Content based trade books are used to support the content areas. SWDs in ICT classes receive frequent, 
targeted instruction in small groups and the ENL Teacher and Special Education teachers articulate on the students' progress 
and what methods students seem most responsive to.   Additionally there are anchor charts and materials in  folders with 
necessary target language resources such as adjectives lists, sentence frames and themed vocabulary.  Additionally poetry,

chants and songs are frequently worked in because these are motivating, engaging and successful strategies that help students 
remember important concepts in a creative and fun way.   In Math classroom teachers use Engage NY curricula materials. 
Teachers of ELLs and of ELLs with IEPS, make content accessible by providing language supports for students. Through the 
school's work with a Math Consultant from NTN, teachers are also given access to a specific website that has remediation 
support and extra practice with KEMS lessons.  Teachers access and apply these lessons and resources as needed.   
Grade-level materials are supported with vocabulary instruction, and language structure supports such as sentence starters or 
frames, and graphic organizers that support understanding and language development. Native language materials such as 
content dictionaries/glossaries,  and personal word walls are also used to support students' understanding of content specific 
vocabulary.  Younger students benefit from individual and class word walls with target math language.  In addition, 
manipulatives are used to allow for concrete visual support of concepts at all grade levels.  Teachers also use math sprints and 
re-teach  and fluency materials that are (optional) parts of Engage Ny when they see students need more reinforcement and 
practice.  Teachers also use centers that focus on specific concepts students need extra support in. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
For ELL Students with IEPs,  IEPs are reviewed each year as part of the annual review process. The general education teacher, 
special education teacher, ENL teacher, related service providers and parents ensure that the student's services are being 
delivered in the least restrictive environment (LRE). The ENL Teacher participates in all IEP meeting for the students that are in 
the ENL program.   Parents can also request a re-evaluation of their child's program and services at any time to consider LRE or 
additional supports in their area of need.  In addition to the IEP process, the school also uses block scheduling for literacy and 
math.  In reading, students are placed in small groups based on their instructional reading level across the grade. The block 
schedule helps to accommodate flexibility to a student's program to support the least restrictive environment for these 
content areas.  Students are streamed to different classes that have designated teachers working with students at their 
specific reading levels.  Students are also mainstreamed for Math in many cases.  ELLs with IEPs also receive services with the 
ENL teacher in groups combined with students who are not ELLs with IEPs.  They are grouped with appropriate partners for 
their partner work and participate in appropriate instructional activities.  Sometimes they are the same as the other students 
in the group.  Sometimes students are given modified activities that parallel what the students who are not ELLs with IEPs are 
doing. Graphic organizers, a shorter product, and shared writing, experience charts and anchor charts are just a few examples 
of the instructional strategies utilized to foster success. 
 
Additionally the teacher tries to give the student shared experiences that they can pull their writing ideas from in order to 
assist with the development of background knowledge and the hands on activities are helpful for students who have memory 
difficulties.  Students are monitored and there is frequent articulation between the ENL Teacher and the Special Education 
teachers.  Many students are in ICT classes rather than Self-Contained classes.  This helps students have the flexibility of 
working with a Special Education Teacher or a General Education teacher.  Students have certain strengths and can work 
within the General Education side in their strengths and work with the Special Education Teacher when they need the extra 
support.  Being in the ICT class helps the students because they have good language models around them and can be exposed 
to higher level thinking and language as a result of the mixture of students. 
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The school uses Fountas and Pinell as a Universal Screener for ELA.  Students determined at-risk will be administered DIBELS as 
a diagnostic assessments to determine areas of need.  According to the screening results  ELL students in grades K-2 
receive RTI services in Literacy.  RTI service is provided in cycles with on-going progress monitoring.  Phonemic awareness and 
phonics interventions are addressed with the Blast and Boost programs for grades K-2.  Fluency interventions are part of the 
targeted intervention program in grades for Grade 2 during station teaching / center time, in small groups, and one to one 
during conferences in reading and writing.  ELLs in the upper grades who have been in the country for three years or less are 
also given RTI services.  They work with out of classroom personnel in literacy (reading and writing) and building vocabulary 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           82 

 

through themes. 
 
The services provided are not limited to subgroups.  Any ELL students who qualify based on our designated assessments 
receive the interventions.  There is a trend however that shows that students who are at the Expanding and 
Transitioning  levels need a focus on expressive academic language while students at the Entering and Emerging levels need 
more vocabulary development through concepts in order to be able to apply the reading strategies they are taught (such as 
pattern books where they use repeated sight words with a theme that the students do not have the vocabulary for yet). 
 
   Vocabulary, background knowledge development through extensive opportunities for students to talk and gain experience 
utilizing academic language and comprehension are addressed through tier one instruction using robust vocabulary 
instruction, read alouds, and guided reading. During interventions, teachers facilitate home language support through the use 
of bilingual picture dictionaries.  For Spanish and French speakers, work is done with cognates to facilitate 
language development. Students also have access to online support that the school has subscriptions to.  MYON reading, Brain 
Pop and World Book online, are just a few of the online supports available in the school.  These supports are content based 
and assist students in acquiring background knowledge and content area (Science, Social Studies) through informational 
passages and videos.  Students also have access to laptops and IPADs to assist with visual support and concept development. 
 
 For math the students use Mathletics and Cool Math Games to help develop math concepts and vocabulary.  Not as many 
ELLs struggle with the math as they do with the reading.  The focus on math intervention is on students in Grades 3-5.  The 
school is working with a math consultant to analyze data.  The teachers are looking at specific data from past years' exams and 
comparing this to how students fared on certain categories of questions.  The school is also supported with additional lessons 
called KEMS lessons which support specific math concepts instead of just Engage NY which often has several concepts within 
the lessons.  Students also focusing on expressive language.  If they know the answer they need to explain how they got the 
answer.  This is a focus of the math interventions.  Additionally the students are given small group instruction at least three 
times a week. 
 
Our school also has a partnership with City Year from Americorps.  The Ciity Year staff are assigned to work in the classrooms 
of students in Grades 3-5.  The City Year staff work with students who teachers designate as target students because they need 
assistance with ELA and / or Math content.  Focus students include but are not limited to the ELLs and this is one aspect of 
additional support for the ELLs. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Improvements to the ENL program will include the shifts of new mandated minutes of integrated ELA into the program. In 
addition to the minimum number of integrated units, the school is also including all flexible units into integrated units to better 
support ELL students within their classroom and content areas. The school's RTI Tier 2 services will also provide systematic 
programs to support Phonemic Awareness and Phonics with a specific focus on grades K and 1 for early intervention.    The 
core literacy program is being kept for Year 2 (Teachers' College Reading and Writing Project).   There is more continuity than 
there was when the school used one program for K-2 and a different program for 3-5.  This school-wide literacy curriculum 
should allow for facilitating success due to the tiered content and the succession of lessons.  Students will get the same prior 
knowledge and concept development at the appropriate level for their grades and will be able to get exposure and re-
exposure to language in a way that develops the language sequentially and from simple to more complex.  Additionally the 
school only had 1 full time and 1 part time ENL Teacher but we now has 2 full time ENL Teachers  so that we can more 
specifically target the students' needs at the different proficiency levels.  Additionally we are looking into center and station 
teaching and interested in sometimes trying to do Integrated ENL instruction in the ENL room with a content teacher instead 
of always just pushing in for Integrated like we have done in the past. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

No program/ services for ELLs at P.S. 146 will be discontinued at this time.   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           83 

 

ELLs are afforded equal access to all school and after school programs.  There are also grants that are available through the 
DOE that are specifically for schools that have a high population of ELLs and SWDs.  The ENL Teacher is always on the look out 
for new grants and recently brought in a program funded through the Office of Arts and Special Projects which continues into 
the current school year as an extension.  All students in the school are  included in the programming and ELLs are given a 
specific part of a final presentation where they speak about their experience creating the project.  This is valuable public 
speaking experience for them. 
 
 The school has a partnership with programs such as the 92  nd   St. Y, Beautiful Me, and Union Settlement Inter-generational 
Tutoring.  This programming includes all students, including ELLs. Programs such as the 92nd St. Y are part of the school's 
curricula. The schedule makes sure that the students are present for the partnership programs and mandated services are 
scheduled around them so students do not miss it.   
 
Additional programs and after-school programs invite ELL participation by sending home flyers to parents in their native 
language with a description of the programs as well as dates/times. In addition to those offered to all students, ELLs and 
former ELLs are invited to participate in an after school Title III program and a Saturday Immigrant Fund program.  The after 
school program incorporates language, literacy, content and technology with a news room theme and includes additional 
opportunities for performing and applying oral language skills through learning about holidays in different cultures and 
applying those into the newsroom themes.  The product of this program is shared with the students' parents and also part of 
the student body. 
The Immigrant Fund program includes separate programs and classes. 
 
Our school also has a partnership with City Year from Americorps.  The City Year staff are assigned to work in the classrooms of 
students in Grades 3-5.  The City Year staff work with students who teachers designate as target students because they need 
assistance with ELA and / or Math content.  Focus students include but are not limited to the ELLs. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
ELLs are instructed in their classrooms using the same curriculum as their English proficient peers. Next Generation Learning 
Standards, Teachers College Reading and Writing, Engage NY Math and Blast/Boost Phonics are the current curriculum the 
school uses for ELL students and (the other students in the school as well). The ELL students also are taught with an awareness 
of the Bilingual Progressions that were created out of the Common Core State Standards.  Students are given appropriate 
resources to help them achieve grade level content, that are based on the language that the bilingual progressions show that 
students need to develop and already have.  Additionally teachers offer all of the scaffolded frames that are available from the 
Teachers College website.  There are language frames and suggestions on modifications for ELLs.  The ENL teachers provide 
any resources they use during small group instruction, to the classroom teachers so they can be aware of how they can provide 
additional language support for the ELLs. The documents are also shared on Google Drive or in Google Docs which is public for 
all the staff to access. 
 
 
 Both the content area and ENL teacher deliver content, with the ENL teacher focusing on the language students need to make 
content comprehensible and to foster language development.  Methods such as partner work utilizing Depth of Knowledge 
Questions and The Danielson Framework as a guide for questioning and discussion techniques, in combination with the 
linguistic knowledge gained from QTEL work and other educational experiences, are utilized during this time.   
 
The ENL students receive additional support during the Teachers' College Reading and Writing mini-lessons.  Graphic 
organizers are designed to help the students follow the sequence of the lesson.  Additionally teachers sit with focus students 
to help drive their talk during the Turn and Talk times. Strategic partnerships appropriate for language development are 
created. Conferencing is also used when students are working independently so teachers can see what additional support 
the ELLs need in content and in expressive and receptive vocabulary related to the content.  The instruction is often done in a

small group and there is also station work at times.  The ENL Teacher designs station work specifically focused on addressing 
the academic vocabulary and strategies for working with unfamiliar vocabulary during this time.  
 
Part of the literacy curriculum incorporates technology into the lessons, specifically Blast/Boost Phonics, which has 
an  interactive technology component that offers additional activities within the lessons. Teachers use the smartboard to 
project the materials or at times the students use individual IPADs or laptops.   For other subject Native language materials, 
such as content based trade books and read alouds, content dictionaries and glossaries are used to support students' 
understanding of the content. There are 
also some translation apps that are used by the students and students also translate for each other.  For students in Grades 3-5 
they are offered the RBERN glossaries that New York state offers for use during the ELA and Math tests.  The students use this 
resource all year.  Additionally the Engage NY math resources online have different languages that the materials are published 
in, so we use those translated materials.  Structures of the students' native language versus structures of English are also 
compared during small group instruction.  There are also several games and language manipulatives that are used as part of 
centers.  The ENL Teacher designs language based stations for use in the classroom during Station Time. 
 
ELL Students also all have access to MYON, a computer based leveled reading program, which is especially utilized for our 
Newcomer ELLs .Mathletics, which is leveled math instruction and World Book online resources. Additionally the school has a 
library and all students are permitted to borrow books from the library.  The library has specific selections appropriate and 
appealing to the ENL students.  Students also borrow books that are related to the themes they are working on and a 
para professional assigned to the library guides them towards appropriate materials.    The teacher in charge of ordering for 
the library is constantly seeking to find books and materials to represent the cultures of our school.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Home language support is delivered in the ENL program model using translations when necessary and home language 
instructional materials. There are bilingual glossaries, picture dictionaries, student to student translations and when applicable, 
teacher translations.  Documents are also translated by the parent coordinator for Spanish documents.  Google translate is 
used for Arabic, French and mandarin.  Classroom environments of Entering/Emerging ELLs also include labels and picture cues 
to incorporate language development.   The teachers and other school personnel use the students' home languages to assist 
when possible (we have Spanish, Chinese and Portuguese speakers among the school staff).  There are also 
IPAD translation  apps that teachers find, share and use with their students.   
 
Students in Grades 3-5 have access to the bilingual glossaries put out by the state (available at NYSED.gov).  The students are 
also provided with the option to use the cognates list that is also available on the same site as the bilingual glossaries.  For all 
content exams, ELLs are offered the opportunity to take the exams in their native language.  For students whose language is 
represented through the DOE's nine main languages, students receive side by side exams and choose which language to take 
the exam in.  They have the option to use it as a resource or to actually take the exam in their native language.  Additionally for 
the students whose languages do not have translated state test versions available (Arabic for example), are given the exam 
through the use of a translator that speaks the native language and the translator translates the English exam verbatim.  The 
math MOSL exam is given to the students in their home language at all grade levels (K-5).  Incoming Spanish speakers are given 
the Spanish LAB to gauge their Spanish academic language and to help decide what language support will help foster 
successful learning experiences.    
 
Formative assessments are frequently used.  Teachers use Exit Slips, Conferences and student work.  Teachers use a portfolio 
based approach.  The portfolio type is more like a work folder.  It is not students choosing their best pieces.  It is rather an 
accumulation of their classroom work and is dated so that products can be compared over time.  Teachers use this to guide 
their inquiry and teacher team meeting work.  They focus on what this (informal) data shows and work to analyze and improve 
the results. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 
 
2018-19 SCEP-FL                                                                                                                                                                                                           85 

 

 

All services and supports at the school are aligned to students' age and grade level. Students' age is considered when placing 
students into a class/program. Schedules of services and resources are reviewed by school administrators to ensure 
appropriate age and grade level content and materials.  Integrated services are done by class/ grade level within the students' 
homeroom class when possible.  The same curriculum that the homeroom teachers are using, is looked at and adapted by the 
ENL Teacher so that appropriate skills can be addressed but the focus can be on the most important and transferable skills 
rather than the entire same products that non ENL students may be producing.  If necessary to put two classes together, the 
ENL Teacher works in her classroom with a classroom teacher.  Students are scheduled in STARS for the minimum number of 
minutes required to be aligned with Part 154 regulations.  For New arrivals, sometimes students are grouped by upper grades 
and lower grades and appropriate content is designed that all grade levels will benefit from.  An Integrated Language Arts 
theme based approach is utilized with units designed by the ENL Teacher and strategies instruction is incorporated that is 
appropriate for the grades. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
The school shares a building with a D75 school but all resources are separate and this does not affect academic, linguistic 
and/or socioemotional needs of our ELLs. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The parent coordinator is available throughout the summer and during the school year to transition newly enrolled families, 
including ELLs, into the school. The school also participates in the district 's Elementary, Pre-Kindergarten Fairs and the Back to 
School Festival before and  throughout the school year to showcase the programs and services available at the school. The 
principal , ENL teacher and content area teachers across grades participate in these events. Additionally the school partners 
with union Settlement to provide students and their families with support transitioning into the school and the 
neighborhood.  The school also reaches out to East Harlem Tutorial for assistance with tutoring students.  There are tutors who 
speak some of the languages of our ELL student population and that really helps with the transition.  There are also camp 
programs in the building and when it is possible, students are offered (late) enrollment in the programs.  The school is working 
with the central office to pilot a program to assist Mexteco speakers (from Mexico) specifically.  We are adding some questions 
to our intake process that can help plus to identify these speakers and are planning events specifically for them such as phone 
blasts and separate meetings to make them feel welcome.   
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

The school does not currently offer language electives.   If there were to be a request for this program, the school would make 
sure to align the program to the Foreign  Language standards. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

P.S. 146 does not currently have a Dual Language program. If we start one we will make an appropriate 
plan.

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
In the first part of the school year, teachers of ELLs provide NYSESLAT and EDAT data to review and analyze ELL data.  Teachers 
are given this data by grade and based on who their students are.  They are taught what the data means.  The notes section 
and at risk sections are specifically pointed out so teachers can get a deeper window on their students' prior educational 
experiences within the school or in another New York City school they transferred from.  The school's current instructional 
focus is to improve students' literacy proficiency with a focus on incorporating more listening and speaking standards and 
activities into daily classroom instruction. These goals are directly aligned to the needs of the ELL students; based on the 
results of the NYSESLAT modalities reading and writing are areas of need and what the EDAT shows.  Research supports that 
experience with developing and focusing on listening and especially speaking about academic content is a bridge for 
developing the reading and writing skills. 
 
  During the second half of the school year (February)  The ENL Teachers provide sessions that teach the staff about the 
bilingual progressions and also the value of utilizing speaking and listening standards for planning r The ENL Teachers 
participate in Teacher team meetings / Inquiry  Team meetings with the Kindergarten and 4th Grade Teachers and rotates at 
times when there is a need to provide ENL support for other grades. Resources are shared with the grades during this time as 
the data is discussed and teachers are planning for upcoming and current units.  This happens throughout the year.  
 
Professional Learning resources that are integrated into sessions at the full staff professional development sessions 
are  related to best practices in listening and speaking as a bridge to reading and writing acquisition and additionally include 
some work with Maria G. Dove and Andrea Honigsfeld's book on co-teaching models and strategies within ENL 
programs.   Additionally, all grade level professional learning includes ELL students as a subgroup when looking at student data 
to develop goals, implement effective strategies and share best practices across classrooms.  Teachers of ELLs (including ENL 
teacher(s) and classroom teachers) also participate in professional development offered at the district, borough, and citywide 
levels including a sequence of six sessions in the district 3 and 4 cohort, Teachers College workshops that focus on ELLs and 
offerings from The Office of ELLs that are mentioned in the newsletter that is sent out to people on the LISTSERV.   Additional 
full staff professional developments take place in March and May.  In March teachers will be introduced to linguistics and 
thinking about language structures.  Additionally teachers will be exposed to the Language Differences versus Disorders 
document.  The session in May will be a check in to see how the offered supports have improved their instruction and planning 
for ELLs this year and suggestions for topics for the following year. 
 
Para professionals are included in all of the training.  Additionally there are specific sessions for para professionals on working 
with ELLs with IEPs.   
 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
  As per the regulations in CR Part 154.2,  at least 15 percent of the professional development offered to the staff at the school 
, is related to ELL topics.They are offered both on site which is delivered by the ESL teachers, and also externally through the 
Office of English Language Learners and Teachers' College.  For the external professional developments, teachers go off site 
and the workshops are delivered by personnel that are not on our school staff. As per CR Part 154.2, the ENL Teachers are sent 
to external professional development sessions through The Office Of ELLs with the District 3 and 4 cohort.  They also attend 
Teachers College workshops that focus on ELLs.  Additionally if there are other topics of interest offered by the Office of 
English Language learners, the ENL Teachers can attend those also.

ELL specific professional development is incorporated within the school's Professional Learning PD Plan and grade level 
professional development for all staff. ELL students are a targeted sub group, therefore strategies, resources, and content 
specific professional development is embedded within the school's overall professional development plan. Agendas and sign- 
in sheets are maintained as records of the content of the professional development activities.   
 
The ENL Teachers provide the professional development on site to the school staff.  The workshops are presented in series 
starting off with ELL data from the NYSESLAT and EDAT, and then continuing the learning through the current school focus and 
addressing how the bilingual progressions correlate.  The bridge that the Listening and Speaking standards can provide for 
successfully acquiring reading and writing skills is also presented to teachers.  Teachers are trained on protocols and (more) 
ways to foster student talk in the classroom.  Teachers also receive training in linguistics and language  structures and how this 
can be useful when differentiating instruction for and assessing ELLs. For the ENL Teachers' professional development 
requirements, there is participation in a PLC cohort with District 3 and 4 Teachers facilitated by Fanny Castro.  Additionally, if 
there is an interest in other programs offered by the Office of ELLs, the teachers (both ENL and non ENL) are permitted to 
participate. Teachers also participate in workshops at Teachers' College (Columbia University).  Teachers who attend outside 
professional development have the folders from the workshops with the materials and the agendas.  Also the teachers 
reference the materials they got at the outside workshops in turnkey workshops to the rest of the staff.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
 The school will utilize the Parent Engagement time on Tuesdays from 2:20pm-3:00pm to schedule individual meetings with 
parents. The ENL teachers create a letter inviting parents to participate in individual meetings  The parent coordinator 
continues 
to reach out to parents that do not set up a meeting with the ENL teacher.  The ENL teacher will maintain a log of each meeting 
including the date, student/parent name.  Translation services are available through bilingual staff, parent coordinator and 
Office of Translation, when applicable.    In addition, the meetings are not always so formal.  The ENL Teacher talks to parents 
at morning arrival and dismissal and keeps a log of the date and when the parents were spoken to about their child's 
progress specifically since many parents work long hours and you have to try to catch them when they are in the building 
already.  Documentation is kept in the ELL (Compliance) binder in the ENL Teacher's classroom.  For students whose parents 
we do not see, there are reminder letters sent and phone calls made.  Several attempts are made for those hard to reach 
parents through the Parent Coordinator or ENL Teacher and a log is kept of attempts to schedule the meetings.  These notes 
are also kept in the ESL Compliance binder in the ENL Teacher's classroom. Parents are also invited to all school wide events. 
There are curriculum nights and parent workshops throughout the year that discuss the overall goals of the school and its' 
programs.  At all parent meetings, the option to use the city's translation and interpretation unit is always available and 
translators that are school based who speak the families' native languages are also assigned and utilized to be present at the 
meetings and events. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
 On the first Friday of each month the school invites all parents to join their children in their classrooms for Family Friday.  The 
classroom teacher plans engaging lessons that provide parents opportunities to learn strategies, skills and educational 
games.  Parents can then use these techniques in the home to assist them in working with their children in their native 
language.  This program allows parents to be a part of the learning experience and fosters openness and community 
involvement in the educational process of their children.  Parents are also encouraged to attend class field trips as 
chaperones.   
 
     The Parent Coordinator and Parent Association hold Professional Development for parents, including ELLs, bi-monthly. One

session each month is dedicated to help parents support their child's learning at home; the other session is based on the needs 
of the parents, which is identified through the PA monthly meetings. Translation services are provided by the Parent 
Coordinator and the Office of Translation, when applicable.  Workshops are also offered during Tuesday's Parent Engagement 
time and events related to ELL regulations and logistics are also explained to parents when there is Back to School Night. 
 
      The school is working on piloting a program for the families of Mexteco speakers.  There are numerous families in our 
school community who speak this dialect from Mexico and are in need of services and supports from how to help their 
children succeed in school to information on community support and resources.  We are planning to have separate welcome 
meetings for these families to help them feel comfortable.  We are seeking to look for other programs that can involve parents 
of the less commonly spoken languages (we have many resources for Spanish speakers) such as Arabic, Urdu and Bengali.   
 
      The school has an involvement with the Hance Family Foundation.  This foundation plans and runs a huge family carnival 
every December to provide a Christmas experience for the school's neediest families.  This is a huge event and the parents 
accompany their children.  Additionally the school has a carnival which partners with an all girls private school.  The PTA and 
the school run this together and parents are invited to attend (and they do). 
Parents are invited to be a part of the ENL After School program.  The program has a news room and presentation related 
theme and parents are invited at  a few specific points throughout the program to see the results of the presentations 
 the students put together as well as to view the art and music they have created as part of the news room creation.  Also the 
school has started a tradition of a school wide presentation through a grant and partnership with 92Y.  The final product is a 
school-wide show where ENL students get valuable performance experience and parents are invited to attend the 
performances. 
 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
The school is constantly seeking to provide programming for the ELL community and to foster an appreciation for the diversity in 
our school community.  Through a grant from the Office of Arts and Special Projects, the school infuses teaching about and 
appreciating other cultures.  Additionally the school is trying to pilot a program for Mexteco speaking families through a 
collaboration with a language access coordinator.  We will continue to seek grants, programs and opportunities for our school 
community! 
 
Our school also has a partnership with City Year from Americorps.  The Ciity Year staff are assigned to work in the classrooms of 
students in Grades 3-5.  The City Year staff work with students who teachers designate as target students because they need 
assistance with ELA and / or Math content.  Focus students include but are not limited to the ELLs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Mona Silfen, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered to 
and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

To asses our school’s written translation and oral interpretation needs, data from the HLIS, Pre-K Language Needs 
Survey, ATS and blue cards were collected and analyzed. During the current registration, when a HLIS survey is 
received the OTELE code is entered into the system. The OTELE code signifies the language spoken at home. On 
the HLIS form and on Emergency Cards, parents indicate the language they would like receive written and oral 
communication from the school. This information is used to determine the languages in which school letters and 
documents are sent to parents. The school also has a Pre-K program. Parents in this program complete the Pre-

Kindergarten Language Needs Survey. Finally, Interviews with teachers, administrative staff and the parent 
coordinator were also conducted to evaluate the school’s translation and oral interpretation needs.  

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

Family contact information is maintained by the main office and classroom teachers to provide immediate access to 
yearly-updated Student Emergency Contact Cards, on which parent preferred language of communication is to be 
noted. The school will utilize all available resources, which may include multilingual staff or Language Line over-the-
phone interpretation, to make expeditious contact with families and effectively communicate necessary information.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

- Language Access posters are posted in the building with name and extension of LAC for more information. 

 

- Staff is aware of LAC and of other staff who speak foreign languages. 

- Signage and information posters posted throughout the school are in Spanish and English and can be provided to 
parents in other languages upon staff or parent request 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

The school provides parents whose native language is other than English a copy of the Bill of Parent Rights and 
Responsibilities in their native language. In addition, parents are asked if they would like if they would like translation 
services. Since over ten percent of the school’s parent population speaks Spanish, the school ensures that school signs 
and report cards are bilingual. Translation and interpreter service signs are clearly posted in the main office, Parent 
Association/Parent Coordinator room and SBST rooms. 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

The school uses the results of the Learning Environment Survey as well as feedback from Parent Workshops to assess 
the quality and availability of services.
