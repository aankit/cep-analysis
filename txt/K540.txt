Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results.

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

The mission of John Dewey High School is to promote our students’ success by providing a rich, 
progressive educational experience with significant entry points for student choice aligned to 
specific career paths. Our vision for providing such an education is grounded in our five learning 
academies: Academy of Business, Tourism and Hospitality, Arts Academy, STEM Academy, 
Academy of Law and Justice and the Pre-Med and Health Careers Academy. We believe that all 
children can learn and be successful when held to high expectations and given appropriate 
supports and interventions that are designed to meet their individual needs.  
 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Through our structure of five small learning communities we expect to expand and capitalize on existing 
partnerships which include the National Academy of Finance, One Goal, Peer Group Connection (PGC), American 
Reading Company, FIRST Robotics, Council for Unity, CATCH, Kingsborough Community College, Computer Science 4 
All, the New York State Marine Education Association and other community based organizations.  

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

John Dewey High School enrolls a diverse group of over 2,325 students. These learners are comprised of 31% Asian, 
33% African American, 22% Hispanic and 12% White. Nearly 20% of our students are English Language Learners, 
nearly 15% are students with IEPs and over 90% qualify for Free or Reduced Price Lunch. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

In alignment with the framework for Great Schools we developed a culture of collaboration around active learning 
strategies through our Classroom Learning Labs and systems for common planning time. Teachers will continue to 
engage in common planning in course teams and grade teams with a key focus on benchmarking and the 
establishment of Model Classrooms. Administration and Instructional Coaches will provide staff with support 
around implementing an inquiry process as the framework for development of curriculum and assessment during 
these times.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
In an effort to promote college and career ready students and in recognition that many of our students enter 
21K540 with below-grade level skills in mathematics, we have prioritized college readiness in mathematics, with 
particular emphasis on developing the college readiness in math of our graduating seniors (Cohort U). 

Students who scored below 3 on 8th grade state Math assessments have been enrolled into a double period 
Algebra 1 or SAGA, a computer based instructional program. This sequence is intended to specifically support the 
learning needs of students who struggle with mathematics coming into high school by providing intensive and 
Common Core aligned instruction in mathematics to the highest-need learners.  

However, by the time these students reach their senior year, 138 out of 498 students (28%) have still not achieved 
City College Readiness in mathematics (i.e. passed the Algebra I regents examination with a scaled score of 70 or 
better). Further, 50% (69/138) of those students who have not achieved college readiness have not yet passed the 
Algebra I Regents examination. A majority of this target population (101/138 or 73%) are comprised of students 
who identify as black or Hispanic, and 29% (40/138) are students with Individualized Education Plans. Both of these 
figures are far above the baseline demographics for the school (55% and 15%, respectively) 

Therefore, the identified goal for improving student outcomes and school performance will focus on raising the 
achievement of students who have not yet achieved City college readiness in mathematics, and our action steps 
will place special urgency on closing the gap in the under performance of black and Hispanic students. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, 20% (27/138) of students who have not yet achieved college readiness in cohort U will increase their 
performance on the Algebra Regents by at least one state performance level through the use of computer based 
instruction.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Students who have passed the Algebra regents, but have not 
achieved the city college ready score (65-69), will be scheduled 
into Advanced Problem Solving. 

Students who failed the Algebra regents (64 and below), will be 
scheduled into an additional Algebra course, for the year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
While we were pleased with the 2017-2018 graduation rate of 82.5%, up from 80% the previous year, we recognize 
that there is room for meaningful improvement within targeted subgroups. With reference to attendance, 
performance, and graduation rate, the analysis of our school data has shown a disparity in English Language 
Learners and Students With Disabilities subgroups. Our target for graduation for the ELL student subgroup was met 
at the school level with a rate of 78.8% but decreased from 83% the previous year. When evaluating our SWDs it 
was noted their performance on Regents averaged far below both yearly growth targets. 

According to the latest School Environment Survey (2017-2018), 90% of the student population feel challenged and 
equally represented in class, however, it is noted that only 51% of students felt supported by teachers when 
struggling and/or upset. This data has prioritized our decision to include social-emotional components into our 
2018-2019 Action Plan for this framework element. 

While data supports the picture that students perceive their classes to be rigorous, the lagging level of perceived 
support indicates a growth area in the form of respect and rapport in student-teacher interactions. It is our belief 
that by better personalizing the experience for our students here at John Dewey and strengthening the 
relationships they have with both their peers and members of our staff, we will see growth in overall student 
outcomes with a specific focus on ELL and SWDs. 

In working towards crafting personalized student experiences, we have created five theme based Small Learning 
Communities (Academy of Fine Arts, Academy for Law and Justice, Academy for Business/Hospitality/Tourism, 
Academy for Pre-Med and Health Occupations , and STEM Academy). Students and faculty members self-selected 
the small learning community they wanted most to join. A sequence of authentic, rigorous, real-world based 
academy electives have been created for each Small Learning Community-providing academy aligned internships. 

Each Small Learning Community has an Assistant Principal, Guidance Counselor, and crisis intervention specialist 
assigned specifically to meet the needs of their students, as well as, the students’ families. In addition to this, the 
leadership team of each academy will meet weekly to track the academic progress of students and the efficacy of 
the academic interventions established to assist them on a continual basis. These weekly meetings will provide the 
themes for our monthly town halls.  

As we move forward in personalizing our students' learning experiences and sustaining a more supportive and 
student-centered classroom environment, we plan to focus on strengthening our teachers’ ability to establish a 
culture for learning and build respect and rapport with all types of learners in support of their academic 
achievement. Ongoing norming on observation of respect and rapport in the context of the Danielson framework 
for teaching reveals a need to ensure that the ratings for Danielson 2A are authentic, more timely and frequent, 
and are consistent with student perceptions. This work will afford the John Dewey High School learning community 
an opportunity to move instruction to a more rigorous, supported, and individualized path.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 17% of JDHS teachers (20/120) who were evaluated on Danielson 2A two or fewer times during the 
2017 -2018 school year will be rated more frequently, with focus on measuring both teacher and student evidence of 
classroom respect and rapport, resulting in a 10% increase in students who feel that their teacher knows them on 
academy survey data.

tool will be shared to cultivate an environment where teachers 
are reflective about their practice. 

Student government will be established through the recruitment 
of students from all five academies to ensure representation of 
all students across grades. Student government will be tasked 
with running townhalls, collecting student concerns and coming

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

As per our 2018 PPOs and 2017 Quality Review, 1.1 (Curriculum) is an area of focus. We recognize the need to 
create systems that will allow our teachers to create cohesive curricula that will provide access for all learners, 
including English Language Learners and Students with Disabilities, and to ensure that curricula are frequently 
adapted and refined as a result of findings from common assessments as well as formative, interim and summative 
data. It is equally important that our teacher teams find time to review the efficacy of the curricula and curricular 
supports that are being put into place. Dedicated time needs to be established in order for teachers to focus on 
student performance and the impact of curricula. 
 
Additionally, as per our 2018 PPOs and 2017 Quality Review, 1.2 (Pedagogy) is also an area of focus. In order to 
strengthen teacher pedagogy and assist our teachers in effectively implementing targeted instructional scaffolds 
and supports, developing multiple opportunities for learning extensions, and in the use of questioning and 
discussion techniques to promote student-centered, inquiry based lessons that engage students in cognitively 
challenging academic tasks and rigorous discussions, we recognize the need to further develop common planning 
time that will foster this endeavor and provide teachers with access to systems that can support this work. Through 
the process of looking at student work products on a regular basis, teachers will be better able to identify 
opportunities for enhanced questioning and discussion, as well as, missed opportunities for more rigorous 
instruction.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, 100% of JDHS teachers (89/89) will collaborate during common planning time with each other and 
instructional coaches to develop and implement a standards based student’s benchmarking system across all core 
contents to increase formative assessment for all students evidenced by an increase of 10% in alignment of 
scholarship data and Regents results.

nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Over the past three years, we have increased the number of staff members in the building dedicated to supporting 
our English Language Learners. Since the 2015-2016 school year, our ENL department has increased by two teachers 
(from seven to nine), and we have added two dedicated guidance counselors to support our ELL and Bilingual 
students. This larger staff has allowed us to expand the courses offered with ENL supports, and has allowed us to 
create new classes to support our students' diverse needs, such as a dedicated class for SIFE/SLIFE students. 
Additionally, our UFT Teacher Center Coach is a TESOL-certified teacher, and has helped to lead regular PDs and 
workshops in order to support all teachers in meeting the needs of ELL students in their classrooms. 

As per the ESSA data from the 2017-2018 school year, the LEP-student subgroup met both school and state targets for 
ELA, Math, and Graduation. We want to meet or exceed that performance in the 2018-2019 school year, and we have 
dedicated supports to help us do that. 

Of our students in cohort U who are still receiving ELL services, 65 students have yet to score a 65 or higher on the 
ELA regents. This number includes two SIFE students, and 32 students whose most recent NYSESLAT score indicated a 
proficiency of Entering, Emerging or Transitioning. In order to meet the needs of these students and help them 
progress towards passing the ELA regents, we will be implementing both academic and socio-emotional supports that 
are targeted towards these senior students. 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 30% (37/123) of ELL students in Cohort U will increase their performance on the Common Core ELA 
Regents by at least one state performance level through targeted Title III and College Access 4 ALL supports.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

At John Dewey High School we are fortunate to have a small but active PTA Executive Board.  

However, given that our school serves roughly 2,300 students and the average attendance at Parent Association 
Meetings includes less than 15 parents, we recognize this as an area in need of significant focus for growth. 

It is our hope that by making several changes we will be able to significantly increase meaningful parent 
involvement in our school; bolster communication between faculty members, parents and guardians; and increase 
our parents' perception of themselves as integral members of our school community. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June of 2019, JDHS will improve targeted parent workshops, family events, and outreach plans by designing and 
implementing two family needs assessments as evidenced by a 10% increase of attendance at PTA meetings from 2017-
2018 school year.

2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
Our school provides professional development opportunities that are aligned with school goals, promote independent 
and shared reflection and enables teachers to improve learning outcomes. We provide and seek Professional 
Development opportunities for teachers in improving pedagogical skills, implementing more collaborative learning 
strategies, incorporating more differentiated instruction techniques into the classroom, attending sessions to support 
staff to assist students in adapting and coping with high school, study skills, organizational skills, and implementing 
Common Core Learning Standards into all lessons.  

We have established an Instructional Support Team comprised of our Professional Development Assistant Principal, 
UFT Teacher Center Instructional Coach, Master Teachers, and Lead Teacher who meet weekly to develop and carry 
out our targeted, differentiated Professional Development Plan.  

Mentoring opportunities exist not only for first year teachers, but second and third year teachers as well in an effort 
to best support un-tenured, less-experienced teachers. Teacher led PD is offered the final Monday of every month 
and staff members self-select the sessions they would like to participate in based on needs that they have identified

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. John Dewey High School , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part 
A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent 
involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the 
families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and 
decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the 
School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed 
members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

John Dewey High School will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 
decision making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          40 

 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s 
Title I program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the 
school’s Title I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated

Developing ELLs – we have a large number of entering and emerging students across the 

Off-track Juniors and Seniors. Of our 320 Juniors and seniors, 185 (Cohorts U and V) are 

Begin description here:            
At John Dewey High School, we serve over 400 ELL students (with over 150 additional 
Commanding students). Based on analysis of data from the EDAT and our internally-monitored 
graduation tracker, we have identified the following subgroups of students that we want to target 
through our Title III programs. By focusing on these groups we include a majority of our 
students in our plans for Title III programs. 
· 
Advanced Proficiency Freshmen and Sophomores. Our recent incoming freshmen ELL 
students have been coming to us with higher (Expanding and Commanding) proficiency levels. 
Remediation and tutoring programs are not always applicable for these students because they 
have a higher proficiency than the students who need tutoring and extra support to be successful 
in their classes. These students are motivated to participate in enrichment programs and college 
preparatory programs, and want opportunities to gain exposure to SAT exams, expectations for 
college applications, and opportunities to explore different colleges and careers. 
· 
“Off Track” in terms of Regents, with 158 students passing 0, 1, or 2 Regents (Data will be 
updated with June/August 2018 Regents Data). These students are often long-term ELLs, and 
struggle with literacy issues in both their native language. Many of these students are looking for 
targeted, subject-specific support, such as ELA Regents preparation or support in their science 
classes. 
· 
four grades, with a concentration in the 10th grade. The majority of these students have arrived 
in the U.S. within the last two years, and have experienced some gains in communicative 
English, but still struggle with academic English, especially in reading and writing. 
At John Dewey High School, 21K540, approximately 550 English Language Learners (including 
Commanding students) in grades 9 through 12 are served through either Transitional Bilingual 
Chinese or through English as a New Language classes.  In order to enable English Language 
Learners to meet the challenging requirements for high school graduation, to meet with success 
in subject classes and required Examinations, and to grow in English proficiency as tested on 
NYSESLAT and for college and career readiness, we will continue to implement Title III 
Saturday and after-school programs for English Language Learners, grades 9 through 12. These 
programs were designed after looking at the EDAT report with data from the 2017-2018 school 
year, and this plan will be updated with our 2018 NYSESLAT Data, our Regents examination 
data for our ELL/bilingual population, ATS reports, and the anecdotal information that we heard 
from both content and ENL instructors about where students are struggling (either in terms of 
progressing in a specific language modality or in acquiring content-specific English vocabulary). 
A review of the our ELLs proficiency levels shows a concentration at the Entering/Emerging 
levels  and Expanding level.  Since the majority of our newcomer students have been testing into 
the Entering proficiency levels, we wanted to make sure that we had targeted programming to 
help these students adapt to school in New York City while also making progress with the 
English language. The majority of our Title III programming is directed towards our Newcomer 
and Entering/Emerging students. Based on both our Regents data and teacher recommendations, 
we included ELA Regents support, Science (Living Environment) support, and Global Regents 
support classes on Saturdays. For our students with greater proficiency, and for our students who

have had success on all of their Regents examinations,we are still encouraging them to come to 
our Title III programs, but we are also supporting them as they attend other after school 
programs, whether at John Dewey or outside of the building. 
Saturday Academy 
Title III NYSESLAT Saturday Academy will be taught by ten [10] teachers: six [6] fully 
certified ESL teachers, one [1] ELA teacher, one [1] science teacher, one [1] social studies 
teacher, and one [1] special education teacher to accommodate approximately 100 ELLs in 
grades 9 through 12, for 23 scheduled 3 hour sessions from October 20th, 2018 to June 8th, 2019 
and serve approximately 100 students. The following are the dates of the Saturday Academy: 
10/20, 10/27, 11/3, 11/17, 12/1, 12/8, 12/15, 1/12, 1/26, 2/2, 2/9, 3/2, 3/9, 3/16, 3/23, 3/30, 4/6, 
4/13, 5/4, 5/11, 5/18, 6/1, 6/8.   To prepare students for college and careers, and support their 
success on upcoming assessments, we use supplemental materials (from the teachers' own design 
or from textbooks only used on Saturdays, such as the National Geographic Cengage series 
Edge) to align our curricula to Common Core Standards and infuse more academic rigor into our 
courses of study. The courses are Unit-based with culminating activities enabling teachers to 
follow the progress of individual students over time, and students to self-monitor and revise 
writing samples over the course of the year.  We shall continue to use a content-based, Common 
Core-aligned, curricula that provides students the opportunity to prepare for assessments such as 
the Common Core Algebra Regents, Common Core English Regents, and the NYSESLAT.  
The program is divided into four (4) classes: an Integrated Science class (co-taught with one ESL 
and one science teacher), one Integrated ELA class (co-taught with one ESL teacher and one 
ELA teacher), and two newcomer ESL classes - one devoted towards the reading and writing 
modalities and one devoted toward the listening and speaking modalities , and one SAT/College 
Readiness class targeted towards are Expanding and Commanding-level students.    
  All classes will be conducted in English with accommodations for student's use of their primary 
language as necessary. All classes have a licensed ESL instructor, with the subject area teacher 
and ESL teacher co-creating and implementing the lessons in the Integrated courses.  
The Saturday Academy meets for three hours for 23 Saturdays, with three field trips being 
planned to take place throughout the year (one fall, one winter, and one spring). 
A sample daily agenda for a Newcomer/Entering-level student may resemble the following: 
9:00 - 10:30 - ESL Class - Speaking and Listening 
1)     Engaging in social conversations 
Using teacher-created conversation cards or conversation games, students practice pronunciation 
and grammatical formation to ask questions to classmates, and respond. The purpose of this 
activity is primarily communicative in nature, but may integrate grammatical structures and 
vocabulary introduced in class. (Heterogeneous grouping) 
2)     Introduction to new vocabulary 
Through visual, oral, and written examples, students will be presented with new vocabulary 
words in isolation, and in context. After learning key vocabulary words, students will have an 
opportunity to practice their speaking skills by working with a partner on a dialogue. Different 
dialogues will be available based on the students/ proficiency levels (Homogenous grouping) 
10:30 - 12:00 - ESL Class - Reading and Writing 
3)     Reading comprehension 
Using leveled readings at or slightly above the students identified lexile level, students will 
complete a reading passage while practicing a modeled reading/studying skill (i.e. taking notes, 
underlining key ideas, paraphrasing/summarizing key paragraphs, etc.) Pre-reading may take 
place by examining pictures, realia, or videos. (Homogenous grouping) 
4)    Writing 
Students will respond to the text using a range of prompts – lower-proficiency students may 
complete sentence frames, while higher-proficiency students will respond to a Regents-

questions and thoughts in their small groups, and with the whole class (Homogenous grouping) 
5)     Closing Assessment: 
Differentiated assessments will be conducted to assess the students’ understanding of the day’s 
vocabulary and academic skill. 
After School Language Support and Tutoring 
After school on Wednesdays and Thursdays, for two hours each day, we have one ESL teacher 
running a language support and homework help class. There will be 40 sessions (20 weeks, 2 
sessions per week) beginning on November 7th and ending on May 23rd. Based on data from the 
NYSESLAT and this year's NYSITELL administrations, this program is aimed at our Newcomer 
and Entering/Emerging level students, but there are also individualized guided projects for 
students to work on if they would like to have assistance preparing for a Regents examination.) 
to improve their reading and listening skills. 
College and Career Readiness 
Through our partnership with Sports and Arts in Schools Foundation (SASF), we have 
implemented a College and Career Readiness program to support our students who are 
demonstrating academic success but who have not independently made progress in planning for 
their path after high school graduation. Our college and career counselor from SASF will meet 
with students after school, plan college trips, and hold information sessions for students and 
parents about different aspects of the college application process. This counselor will work to 
build students' language around the theme of college and career readiness, and will work with 
students to develop professional skills such as resume writing, interviewing, networking, and 
more. 
Program Coordination and Record Maintenance 
Throughout the implementation of the Title III Saturday Academy and After School programs, 
the AP of ESL will provide support to participating staff and students, monitor student and 
teacher attendance, act as a liaison with Guidance, and secure appropriate instructional and 
assessment materials for teachers to use in their after. The AP will facilitate recruitment of 
students, provide, distribute and collect translated parent notification and consent forms, provide 
food services, arrange weekly distribution of Metrocards, and coordinate all trips.  The AP will 
work with one of the secretaries to maintain all Title III records and files, and will ensure that 
teachers are keeping portfolios of students' work throughout the after school and Saturday 
programs. For each session, (both for Saturday and After School), we maintain copies of total 
attendance, class attendance, lunch attendance, and Metrocard distribution. With their payroll 
information, teachers are required to submit their lesson plans and a copy of student work.

Ongoing collaborative school-wide efforts  ensure that considerable outreach is conducted to 
parents/guardians of immigrant students.  On October 13th, a Newcomer Parent Orientation will 
be held. Our newcomers mostly consist of immigrant students. The invitations are mailed in the 
respective home languages, and phone calls reminding parents of the Orientation are made in the 
parents' home language. During the meeting, oral interpretation is provided in Chinese, Spanish, 
and Arabic. For new parents who are not able to attend, we make personalized phone calls home 
in the parents' native languages to provide important information, and to invite parents to come 
to the school at another time to meet with teachers and guidance counselors. The parents arere 
informed about the standards, credit requirements, exam schedules, and after school programs 
designed to support their children. In addition to workshops welcoming parents of newly-arrived 
students, outreach is made to all parents of immigrant students in the Fall term, with the 
collaboration between the Second Language Department and the Pupil Personnel Services 
Department.  
 
Ongoing communication with parents of ELLs is an important component of our program and is 
conducted through multilingual phone outreach, multilingual informational bulletins, school 
announcements, and letters.  All teachers and staff throughout the school have been receiving 
training on communicating with ELLs and parents of ELLs, and have received demonstrations 
on how to use the new Language Line. We also have personal outreach that is conducted by

guidance counselors to students and families who have not been attending the Language 
Immersion Program. 
Moving forward, we hope to gather more information about our parents through a parent 
engagement survey that is being developed in collaboration with our parent coordinator, our 
guidance department, and the ENL department. We hope to use this information to better plan 
our parent events, and to better schedule the events in order to increase attendance. Currently, we 
plan to conduct Parent meetings in February and March for all families of immigrant students to 
familiarize parents with the Common Core standards, Regents exams, and the NYSESLAT.  This 
will be an opportunity to collaborate with families to ensure that students are aware of the 
importance of the assessments. We are also working to increase parent attendance at the Family 
Engagement events held by the Division of Family and Community Engagement. For each event, 
we post the information on our Facebook page, send multilingual letters home, and make 
multilingual phone calls to discuss the events with parents. 
For each parent engagement event, we organize our outreach efforts, as well as the event's 
agenda and attendance, into our Title III folder.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use results from the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT to determine initial programming for students. Within the classes, we use 
Regents-based assessments, NYSESLAT-type tasks, and teacher-created assessments to guide instructional planning for our 
ELLs.  In the ENL/ELA classes, we use Common Core-aligned benchmark writing tasks to assess growth and plan for better 
instruction. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

We have teacher teams at each grade level. These teams plan together, and review assessment data (and individual items of 
student work) together. The teams, along with an assistant principal or lead teacher, then plan for how to act on the 
assessment data for upcoming instruction. On a larger scale, the entire ENL department uses common planning time to meet 
regularly to both discuss particular students' progress, and larger trends across classes. We then discuss whether we will 
address these issues in class, through our supplemental programming, or both. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We use baseline assessments at the beginning of the semester to gauge students' currents proficiency levels, and to use as a 
baseline from which to assess growth and progress. These baseline assessments take place in our ENL/ELA classes, since all of 
our ELL students (including our commanding students) have an ENL/ELA class. These assessments include a mix of language-
based tasks and content (ELA) material. Our ELA and ENL coteachers then evaluate the data together. 
In these ELA classes, students complete a series of benchmark assessments in each unit. These benchmarks include both 
reading comprehension (multiple choice) questions and writing tasks. In the ENL/ELA classes, teachers adapt the benchmarks 
slightly to include evaluation of specific language objectives, whether they be related to vocabulary or grammar. These results 
are tracked in a spreadsheet so that it is easy to track both an individual student's progress and to evaluate the progress of an 
entire class or an entire grade. 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Our teacher teams, and our guidance counselor teams, work to address interventions and to track the success of their 
interventions. These teams meet on a weekly basis to discuss assessment results, attendance data, or other anecdotal data. 
Our teacher teams are arranged to include both ENL teachers, their content co-teachers, and guidance counselors so that the 
discussions about data can be as informed as possible. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
We use the NYSESLAT exam and Regents examinations to assess the needs of the students, and to work to plan programs to 
meet students' needs. We begin our analysis by using the EDAT  tool, which helps us to summarize the needs and abilities of 
our ELL population.  
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

Before the start of each semester, the Assistant Principal of ENL meets with the ENL and Bilingual guidance counselors in order 
to review the testing data, and make any changes to programming in order to meet students' needs and the requirements of 
CR Part 154. 
 
As an ENL/Bilingual department, we review the data at the beginning of the year as a team to help us plan to improve our 
instruction. We look at the data as a whole, teachers examine the data for their specific classes, and we look at the data for a 
few individual students. At the end of these meetings, teachers walk away with a data-based understanding of their strengths 
and areas for growth for the year. The data informs the initial planning conferences that take place between the teachers and 
administration. Throughout the year, this data is referred to  
 
We also use the data to plan for our after school and Saturday programming. In September, we use the data to determine 
which types of Title III programs to offer, and to determine which students to target for the supplementary programs.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

          For the stand-alone ENL classes, students are largely grouped heterogeneously, with primarily Entering and 
Emerging students being programmed for those classes. The 9th graders are programmed for a special section of 
stand-alone ENL that is aligned with their integrated ELA course (which is also for only entering and emerging 
students). For the 10th, 11th, and 12th graders, students are grouped primarily by grade for the standalone classes. 
For the integrated courses, students are grouped heterogeneously within each grade. For the 9th grade students, 
integrated ELA is divided into two proficiency groups - Entering and Emerging in one class and Transitioning, 
Expanding, and Commanding in another class. Each grade has an additional standalone class for entering and 
emerging students.          

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

   In the Bilingual Program, students take ESL classes (according to the placement described above), Bilingual Content-
area classes and Native Language Arts classes.  For content courses, we offer Global History Year 1, Global History 
Year 2, and US History, as well as Living Environment and Chemistry.  According to the transitional model of Bilingual 
Education, the amount of English used in Bilingual content area classes increases as students advance in proficiency 
(during the first year, the percentage of Native Language to English is approximately 80% to 20%, during the second 
year, the percentage used is approximately 60% Native Language to 40% English and during the third year 
approximately 20% Native Language to 80% English).    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

   
All of John Dewey High School's ELLs (Entering through Commanding) are in an Integrated ELA course (programmed by grade 
level) for more than a full unit (44 minutes a day) every week. In addition, all of our Entering and Emerging students are 
programmed for two Standalone ENL classes that meets daily (with one ENL teacher in each class). Entering students are also 
programmed for an integrated social studies or an integrated science course depending on their grade and their credits. For 
students in the bilingual program, in addition to their ENL classes, they are programmed by the bilingual guidance counselor 
into the appropriate native language class, and the appropriate number of bilingual content classes (we offer bilingual Social 
Studies and Science) based on the student's proficiency level. Programs are reviewed by the counselors and the ENL 
coordinator to ensure that instructional minutes are delivered in a manner aligned with CR 154. 
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
In our ENL program, ELL students are in their grade-appropriate content classes with other non-ELL students. In the integrated 
content (ELA/ENL) classes, instruction utilizes adapted readings with additional vocabulary support, more visual aids, and 
writing support with sentence frames/sentence starters to help students respond to content-based writing prompts. All 
content courses - whether they are integrated or not - utilize bilingual resources such as dictionaries, glossaries, and bilingual 
Regents Examinations to help students learn the content and make progress towards the Common Core Learning Standards. In 
our bilingual program, content is delivered by bilingual teachers in Chinese and in English.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

For our Chinese population, the language of instruction in HLA is Mandarin. The regular HLA teacher is fully licensed in 
Mandarin Chinese. There are usually three levels of HLA: beginning, intermediate and advanced, in addition to AP Chinese. 
Annual evaluation includes the Chinese Reading Test as well as the LOTE Examination. With regard to our Bilingual Program in 
Chinese, students take ENL classes, Bilingual Content-area classes and Native Language Arts classes. Our HLA teacher 
administers interim assessments twice a semester to track progress towards the Chinese Reading Test and the LOTE 
examination. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

At Dewey, instruction is differentiated for ELL subgroups in the following ways:a. To support Dewey's SIFE population, audio 
visual materials are used in ENL, Native Language,  and ENL/Bilingual content-area classes. We are also implementing the 
Bridges curriculum to provide a targeted layer of support for these students.   Students are referred to the Pupil Personnel 
Team for interventions, and our ENL and bilingual guidance team works closely with these students to help them transition to 
life in the United States.  Consistent and ongoing outreach is made to parents.  Students are encouraged to participate in Title 
III Saturday and After-school programs.  Bilingual, ESL, NLA and content-area teachers attend Professional Development 
workshops to discuss strategies and necessary interventions.  
b. Classroom teachers differentiate instruction. Teachers (both general content and ENL) use strategic pairings and groupings 
so that Newcomer ELLs feel welcomed and supported in their classes. Bilingual, ESL, NLA and content-area teachers attend 
Professional Development workshops to discuss strategies and necessary interventions.  A common planning team and a 
common prep period have been implemented for Professional Learning Communities to address newcomer issues. An ENL 
advisory has been set up so that Newcomer students can get extra support; ENL teachers are available to assist students with 
classwork, preparation for the ELA Regents, and communication skills. c.  For ELLs receiving service 4 to 6 years we apply for 
extension of services to support these students in their efforts to learn English and meet with academic success.  In order to 
assist students in reaching proficiency in all four language modalities we implement a variety of instructional strategies and 
methodologies in both the ESL and the Chinese Bilingual programs.  These include the following:  peer tutoring, small group 
instruction in ESL and ESL and Bilingual content-area, before, during and after-school, use of audio-visual materials, ongoing 
and consistent PPT intervention and parental outreach, Title III Saturday and After-school Programs, and College Now classes. 
Additionally, bilingual libraries are utilized in classrooms.  Bilingual, ESL, NLA and content-area teachers attend Professional 
Development workshops to discuss strategies and necessary interventions. The bilingual counselor, ENL counselor, and the 
ENL coordinator are reviewing the performance of students receiving 4-6 years (or more) to determine if they have any 
learning needs that are not only language related. d. When students enter in 9th grade, the ENL coordinator works with the 
ENL and Bilingual Guidance counselors to conduct student interviews, collect student work, and observe long term ELLs in 
classes. This data goes towards making a plan to assess what ENL supports are working, and to assess if additional supports are 
necessary to support student learning. In ESL, ESL-content-area, Bilingual content-area and NLA classes, bilingual and ESL 
strategies and methodologies are used to instruct these students.  Differentiated instruction is provided in each class to 
accommodate the learning styles and learning rates of these students. Where applicable, technology is used to enhance 
instruction.  Small group instruction provides interaction between LTEs and teachers on a daily basis. The unique features of 
the school include an extended day for students to work with teachers in small groups for independent study projects. e. 
Former ELLs are still encouraged to attend the department's Regents Preparation classes on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and 
Saturdays. On a case-by-case basis, some former ELLs are allowed to take a bilingual class in a particular subject area. Teachers 
in all subjects are made aware (during targeted professional development sessions) that former ELLs (identified by a unique 
"Commanding" official class code) are eligible for accommodations for Regents exams so that students have an opportunity to 
practice with those supports during class.

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
           For ELLs with special needs, Dewey provides a variety of services.  ELL-SWDs are provided with ESL services as per their 
proficiency level on the NYSESLAT and also with the other related services as indicated on their IEPs, (small classes, SETSS, 
Integrated Co-Teaching, related services of counseling or speech), and small group instruction.  They also are encouraged to 
attend the school's Title III programs. At the beginning of the year, all teachers receive training on accessing and reviewing 
their students' IEPs so that they can use that information to prepare for instruction. This enables the teachers to differentiate 
instruction to address each student's individual needs.  In some cases, an ENL teacher will work with a self-contained class to 
support the ELL students language acquisition needs within the self-contained setting. John Dewey staff are currently working 
on creating a class targeted to address the literacy levels of many of our ELL-SWDs.       
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
        John Dewey High School uses curricular, instructional and scheduling flexibility to meet the diverse needs of ELL-SWD’s 
within the least restrictive environment in the following ways: in addition to ELL-mandated classes, students with disabilities 
are also programmed for either self-contained classes, special education teacher support services, or integrated co-teaching 
classes.  Vocabulary is stressed using adapted textbooks, high interest/ low reading leveled literature. Classroom instruction 
uses specialized strategies and methodologies as well as the use of graphic organizers.  Within classes, students are divided 
into small groups using differentiated activities and worksheets.  Alternate Placement Paraprofessionals are assigned to 
Bilingual students with disabilities.      
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Targeted Intervention Programs for ELLs:  All classroom instruction is delivered in English, with the exception of bilingual 
classes in Social Studies and Science, in which instruction is delivered in English and Chinese. 
 
In order prepare ELLs for the ELA Regents, we offer on-track and off-track Regents Preparation Classes. At the beginning of the 
2018/2019 school year, the AP of ENL analyses the "Grad Tracker" - a document created to track the progress towards 
graduation for all John Dewey students. Based on the analysis, our Title III programming will be adapted to meet the needs 
identifies, whether they be support in preparing for Regents examinations or plans for helping students pass classes and earn 
credits.  Additionally, ENL and ELA classes address the needs of ELLs by integrating ENL strategies with the ELA content and 
curriculum. Teachers have received professional development, and differentiate instruction and implement ESL strategies and 
interventions. Through the Title III Saturday Academy we continue to address the needs of ELLs who are not advancing in 
levels (especially in listening and speaking as indicated on the NYSESLAT Modality Report) by infusing more rigor into the 
courses.  In all of our programs and classes, we emphasize exposure to level-appropriate and rigorous texts to lay a foundation 
for the ELA Regents Examination and CCLS ELA Assessments.  We will continue to infuse cultural literacy through trips to the 
theater in Manhattan, museums, or city tours.  The AP ESL and the AP English work together to ensure that the ELA needs of all 
ELLs are met from Entering through Commanding levels.Content-Area Classes for ELLs:  In the ESL and Bilingual content-area 
classes, teachers use a variety of scaffolding and differentiated instructional methodologies to make content more accessible 
to ELLs.  In the Chinese bilingual content-area classes teachers provide instruction in two languages and address ESL 
language  support in the four language modalities.  Visual and auditory resources are used.  Additionally, teachers use a variety 
of graphic organizers, word walls, concept maps, strategic groupings, brainstorming activities. Targeted professional 
development sessions are presented to all content areas.  Mathematics: The Math and ESL teachers have also met to discuss 
periodic assessment results and to work together on curricular and instructional needs for this population.  Last year, some 
Title III funding was used to purchase math manipulatives to support SIFE students and other students who had an inconsistent 
mathematics background. As in all subject areas, special attention is given to strategies to increase ELL attendance, credit 
accumulation and student participation and achievement in scheduled Regents Examinations.Science:  With regard to targeted 
intervention programs for ELLs in Science, science teachers are helping these students develop literacy skills, listening skills and 
study skills.  In order to ensure that ELLs develop solid literacy skills, teachers provide students with key science words 
presented visually on the board and on word walls with definitions; provide essential science vocabulary in advance; provide 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

visual cues such as pictures, charts and graphs so that students can extract meaning from material.  Additionally, teachers use 
graphic organizers to visually plot complex material.  They lead students to identify the key points of the lesson and verbalize 
them in English.  Hands-on activities are used to reinforce concepts.  Science teachers pair ELLs to increase involvement with 
one another.  Teachers help students develop listening skills by presenting information and directions both verbally and 
visually; increasing reading aloud from content-specific texts and readings in each lesson, modeling the pronunciation of 
difficult words in the lesson and having students repeat vocabulary.  Science teachers help ELLs develop study skills by 
encouraging them to use textbook features such as captions, bold type and italics.  They also encourage students to practice 
study questions in the text and in online sites that have an audio component. Students are prepared for in-class exams and 
Regents through the use of review materials which use all learning modalities.  Students are encouraged to re-write class notes 
and vocabulary words every night. Technology: Students use desktop computers and laptops for instruction.  Instruction 
utilizes visual aides to motivate creativity.  We have infused technology into the Title III Saturday Academy.  Students increase 
their word processing, writing and editing skills, as well as learn how to increase efficiency when using the Internet to gather 
information. Students also practice their communication (speaking and listening skills) when they learn how to create and 
present using PowerPoints.Social Studies: Social Studies classes are highly supported by ENL teachers as the level and the 
amount of reading is so often challenging for our ELLs. Strategies such as word walls, guided notes, picture-heavy PowerPoints, 
and regular vocabulary work supports students' language acquisition as they simultaneously learn the content.      
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

The following programs/improvements are some of the initiatives being planned for the 2017-2018 school year: 
 
- Content support during the after school program, targeted to 9th and 10th graders struggling in their content classes, or 
upperclassmen who need to review for the Regents. Currently, the plan is to focus on Living Environment, the class/Regents 
where ELLs are most falling behind their non-ELL peers. 
- ESL Advisory to support primarily Newcomer and SIFE students in their classes and in their acquisition of basic literacy skills. 
While this was during the school day, counselors and teachers will be working with the students after school during the school 
year. 
- Targeted professional development created and presented by the ENL department to address the needs of content teachers 
teaching ELLs. ENL teachers will be paired with different content departments, and will be their designated ELL resource for 
the school year. In addition to presenting the departments with monthly PDs, the ENL teachers will have both formal and 
informal conversations with the department's teachers surrounding supporting ELL students. 
- An ELL Attendance team to analyze attendance data and to make outreach to students/parents. This happened on a smaller 
scale in the 2016-2017 school year, but we want to make it a larger area of focus for next year. We need to have structures 
and systems in place to support students' attendance in daily classes, but also in the support programs. 
- An Long-Term ELL intervention team (bilingual guidance counselor, ENL counselor, and ENL coordinator) to collect data on 
long-term ELLs and to assess what is/isn't working to support these students. We started this in the 2016-2017 school year, 
and we were able to successfully have three of our long-term ELLs evaluated for special education supports. Moving forward, 
the ENL/Bilingual guidance counselors and the ENL coordinator will be beginning the year by having meetings with the Long-
Term ELLs, and having a conversation about their strengths and weaknesses in school. Portfolios will be started for these 
students, and the guidance team will meet quarterly to evaluate student work samples, teacher anecdotals, and assessment 
data. 
 
    
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We do not intend to discontinue any specific program for ELLs   
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs are provided with school programs through communication by the school's ENL and bilingual guidance counselors. All 
activities - from sports teams to musical theater - are available to ELLs and the ENL teachers and counseling staff encourage 
ELL students to participate.  In addition, students are invited to attend Title III Saturday School, a large program that provides 
ENL classes aligned to student's ability, as well as integrated classes in content areas such as math, social studies, science and 
art.     
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In addition to teacher-created curricula aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards and adaptation of materials provided 
by the Office of English Language Learners, 9th and 10th grade students will use Achieve 3000 so that their Lexile score can be 
determined, and for them to work with rigorous reading material.      
In content areas such as science and social studies, modified versions of textbooks were purchased to support ELL students 
both in the classes and in after school programming. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Support for Native Language Arts instruction at Dewey is provided in the Chinese Bilingual program as follows: Instruction is 
provided at the beginning, (no need this year), intermediate and advanced levels, by two teachers who are fully licensed in 
Mandarin Chinese, Ms. C. Leung and Ms. P. Wang.  Bilingual instruction in Chinese and English is also offered in content-area 
classes in Social Studies, Science, and Mathematics.  (We also offer Foreign Language Chinese as a foreign language choice and 
the students are also scheduled for an NLA class on period daily.)Additional Native Language support for all major languages at 
Dewey is given:•           Welcome meetings are held in the Fall and Spring with translated services•           School 
correspondence and outreach are delivered in Native Language using in-school translators or the Translation Line from the 
DOE. Professional development has been presented to all staff (both pedagogical and non-pedagogical) regarding how to use 
the translation line to communicate with parents.•           Title III Parent Information and Involvement Meetings and Parent / 
Teacher Meetings are held with the assistance of Bilingual and ESL counselors and school translators•           Peer-Tutors assist 
students in ESL, Bilingual and Content-Area classes.•           Title III After-School Bilingual/ESL tutoring (with ESL Teachers) for 
Science, Mathematics, ELA, Social Studies.In the ESL and ESL content-area classes, (as well as in the bilingual classes), native 
language support is given in the form of dictionaries and glossaries. Foreign Language/ESL Classrooms, Resource Center and 
the school library possess Native Language book collections.  Peer tutors from our Honor Academies assist students in native 
Language as well as in English.  Many staff members at Dewey are multilingual, so they too provide support to Native Language 
speakers. This year, a survey was sent to all staff so that there would be a log of all the staff members willing and able to 
support with translation services for our ELL students and their parents. 
 
    
 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

John Dewey ensures that required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  All materials, 
texts, and resources used for the instruction of ELLs are age-appropriate and infused with academic rigor to ensure that these 
students have full access to the instructional program and are on a level playing field with their English-proficient peers. In our 
Integrated ELA classes, all ELLs are reading a Shakespeare text, but teachers are using ENL strategies and additional materials 
to support students' comprehension of the text. Instruction is standards-based and the students are challenged.  ELLs are 
expected to achieve to high standards with appropriate supports and interventions.  ESL classes are infused with content area 
material and informational texts in accordance with CCLS standards.  We have carefully selected materials from a variety of 
genres that are appropriate for high-school students.      
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
N/A 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
ELLs have the same opportunities as the non-ELL population at John Dewey High School. ELLs have the opportunity to meet 
with guidance counselors from the first day the enroll at Dewey. The guidance counselors, along with the ENL Coordinator, the 
Parent Coordinator, and the Testing Coordinator help to introduce the student and their parents to all of the different 
programs (both academic and social) that John Dewey has to offer.

ELLs are offered access to a full range of foreign language classes in Chinese and Spanish.      
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
All staff serving ELLs receive professional development through a variety of venues, including staff development days, training 
by the ENL Department, in-house workshops, professional learning communities, departmental meetings, and inter classroom 
observations and inter visitations.  A UFT instructional coach, Teresa Devore,  leads the majority of our professional 
development offered to teachers of ELLs. The instructional coach was a highly effective ELL teacher in her previous 
school.  Most of her workshops are driven around topics such as literacy and engagement, or modeling of specific learning 
activities that can be implemented the next day in teachers' classrooms.  The UFT coach also supports co-teaching teams by 
observing and providing immediate feedback. This year, Ms. Devore is leading day-long coteaching workshops for the ENL 
teachers to work with their coteachers on planning and teaching strategies. In addition, the coach regularly meets with 
teachers of ELLs in the UFT Teacher Center to design and refine lessons to meet the needs of ELLs.   
    The ESL AP makes outreach to the Mathematics, Social Studies and Science Departments in order to better serve the needs 
of our ELL population.  These conversations, along with the ENL department meetings, influence the department-specific 
professional development . The AP of ESL and the AP of English work together to align assessments to both ELA Common Core 
Standards and to ENL goals in all modalities on a consistent basis to ensure the progress of ELLs in classes as well as on 
assessments. The Assistant Principals and teachers of ELLs in the Math, Science, ELA and Social Studies Departments work with 
the AP ESL in sharing best practices in order to serve our ELL population as effectively as possible.  
 
Some of the topics to be covered at professional development sessions (for ELL teachers, deans, and other staff) include: 
•          Building Professional Learning Communities 
•          Implementation of teacher teams across subject areas/ELLs 
•          Implementation of scaffolded instruction and differentiated instructional methodologies for ELLs in all content areas 
•          Integrated Content-Areas and coteaching strategies 
•          Interim and Predictive assessments (using data for instruction)for ELLs 
•          NYSESLAT Administration, testing and scoring 
•          SIFE/Long-Term ELL strategies 
•          Deans office/discipline strategies with ELLs 
•          Implementation of ESL strategies and methodologies in content-area classes for ELL 
•          Differentiating Assessments for ELLs 
•          Training in Academic Language and Literacy 
 
This year, our guidance department is working closely with the ENL department and with all content teachers to support 
students emotional health and development as well as their academic development. The guidance staff is providing 
professional development to all staff members on the resources that they are able to provide for ELL students, and on 
communication strategies for building relationships with students who are in the process of acquiring English.At the beginning 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

 

of each school year the Assistant Principal Organization meets with newly-hired staff to outline DOE and school policy and 
instructional programs for ELLs.  The Assistant Principal for ENL provides ongoing ENL training throughout the year during 
professional development workshops and during ENL department meetings.  We keep copies of Agenda and Attendance 
sheets from all Title III Professional Development and Network sessions on file so that we have accurate records of the 
development that we have done and the teachers that have participated.Throughout the year teachers attend workshops 
outside the school building - at the UFT center, NYU, CUNY, or at South Brooklyn Borough Support Center events. John Dewey 
High School is dedicated to the consistent improvement of teaching and learning  through ongoing professional development.  
 
   
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 
ENL teachers participate in professional development during their weekly department meetings, and at workshops provided by 
outside organizations (universities, the UFT, the Borough Support Center, etc.) throughout the year. 
 
For the in house meetings/professional development, agendas and attendance records are maintained by the ENL coordinator. 
When a teacher goes to an off-site PD, they submit a copy of the agenda to be filed in our meeting/professional development 
hour. If a teacher attends a PD related to ELLs offered by our own UFT Teacher Center, the teacher center coach shares the 
agenda and the attendance with the ENL coordinator to be filed. Between the professional development sessions provided by 
the ENL Coordinator and the outside PDs attended 
For content teachers, ENL teachers lead monthly professional development sessions on a topic related to instructing ELLs 
(detailed above). These regular sessions, combined with ELL-specific development that occurs during every staff development 
day, account for at least 15% of the total hours of professional development.          
              
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Ongoing collaborative school-wide efforts  ensure that considerable outreach is conducted to parents/guardians of ELLs in the 
parents' native languages. This outreach takes place in the form of letters, phone calls, emails, and outreach through our 
online portal, PupilPath.  We regularly utilize the Translation Line and our own in-school staff translators to communicate with 
parents. Throughout the year, all staff members are trained on how to use the translation line in order to communicate with 
parents.  
 
ELL parents are invited to attend Parent Association meetings and functions, as well as Title I, Title III and Part 154 
events.  Agendas and attendance sheets are maintained for each event. This year, we have had more Spanish-speaking 
students and Arabic-speaking students (and parents) come to our school.  To accommodate these growing groups,  welcome 
sessions in the Fall and in the Spring are advertised in both Arabic and Spanish, and extra outreach is conducted by our 
bilingual staff to help parents and students feel welcome in our school. In addition to workshops welcoming parents of newly-
arrived ELLs, outreach is made to all ELL  parents in the Fall and the Spring terms under Title III , with the Second Language 
Department and the guidance department.  Workshops are offered to familiarize parents with technological tools available 
through the DOE website.  As previously mentioned in this report, ongoing communication with parents of ELLs is an important 
component of our program and is conducted through phone outreach and multilingual informational bulletins, letters, emails, 
and phone calls.   We continue to maximize our intervention services in order to ensure success for our ELLs on NYSESLAT and 
the Regents Examinations.  The Intake Coordinator and our bilingual guidance counselor visit all ESL classes to explain the 
importance of NYSESLAT, predictive assessments and the timeframe for each of the sub-tests to ELLS.  In addition, they 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

 

distribute multilingual letters in class for students to bring home to their parents.  A second set of letters is mailed home to 
parents of ELLs.  These letters provide an explanation of the importance of the NYSESLAT and predictive assessments as well as 
provide the dates of each sub-test of NYSESLAT.  We also conduct phone outreach in the parents' native language, and invite 
any parent to come in to meet with the ENL coordinator, guidance counselors, or teachers should they be interested in getting 
more information or becoming more involved with the school.  The ENL Assistant Principal and the guidance counselors host 
parent information sessions in the evening to inform parents of upcoming assessments and graduation requirements. Our 
parent community is apprised of our progress as a result of sustained informational and orientation activities, including parent 
surveys.  This year, we hope to gather more data from parent surveys so that we can adapt our programs to meet the needs of 
our changing parent population. 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
While we have increased communication with parents as a result of the new Translation Line, we are still working on involving 
more students in the day to day school events. We hope that parent surveys (sent in the parents' home language) will help the 
ENL team to better identify what programs the ELL parents want to see/participate in at the school, and what times/dates 
work best for parents to attend school functions.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Connie Hamilton, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

* The Field Language Access Coordinator and Translations & Interpretation Unit will communicate with the LACs 
on translation,

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The Assistant Principal of ENL, the NYSITELL Coordinator, and a Community Coordinator (our LAC), oversee the 
completion of the HLIS for incoming students. Our NYSITELL Coordinator completes the survey with the new 
family, and works with our Parent Coordinator to enter the home language code. ATS reports (such as the RPOB) 
are consulted to examine any language information for students already enrolled in the system. Also, Blue Card 
information and Home Language Surveys are kept on file.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

services are used to communicate key 
information with parents. 

At these events, we use documents 
that are already translated by the DOE, 
and we have staff members to 
translate to our parents/students who 
speak other languages. In advance of 
our session, we will make 
arrangements to hire a translator 
(translators) if we anticipate needing 
additional support with translations.  

As these evenings are opportunities for 
our guidance counselors to speak one-
on-one with parents or guardians 
about their students' concerns, we 
primarily utilize over-the-phone 
interpretation on an as-needed basis.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

We have a robo-call system that automatically translates phone messages to parents. Our parent coordinator (LAC) 
records the phone message that goes out to the families. Our parent coordinator also 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

Beginning in the 2016-2017 school year, the majority of staff members (administrators, teachers, community 
coordinators, and secretaries) were able to participate in training and demonstrations of how to use the over-the 
phone translation services to communicate with parents. In addition, staff members were shown how to use the 
language brochure provided by the NYC DOE to offer a way for visiting parents, guardians, or community members, to 
indicate their preferred language of communication. To remind staff of protocols and procedures, and to help inform 
new staff members of resources available to ensure accurate communication with parents, information on these 
resources will be reviewed and distributed during our school-wide professional development sessions that take place 
at the beginning of the school year, and throughout the year on Chancellor's Conference days. If staff members need 
additional assistance, they are referred to our Second Language Department, or to our LAC.  

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

 

  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

All of these documents have been procured and displayed in their appropriate locations. For any additional signage 
being posted, school staff know to communicate with our LAC to see if translated signage is helpful and to facilitate 
the translation of such signage.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We will conduct a survey of all Limited-English-Proficient parents by December to evaluate the communication they 
have received from the school thus far. We will send out a survey, and work to get responses by phone (via over-the-
phone translation services). We will use the feedback to adjust our future communication accordingly.  

 

Additionally, in our ongoing communication with parents and guardians, we keep records of any additional/updated 
preferences for languages of communication.
