Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Cambria Heights Academy’s Mission Statement 

revised June 2018 

Cambria Heights Academy is a small, public high school focused on building community. We pride ourselves on 
creating opportunities for students to engage with technology meaningfully. Our CTE Program in software 
engineering molds young men and women into creative, experienced problem-solvers and critical thinkers. Our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

students receive a highly personalized and rigorous education through consistent academic and social supports, 
including a rich advisory program, a variety of AP and college courses, work-based learning experiences, and 
community service opportunities. Our students will be the leaders and innovators of the next generation. 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The following instructional programs/partnerships make Cambria Heights Academy a unique school: 

 

ADVISORY (REQUIRED 9-12) 

An important part of the school’s mission is to provide each student with a supportive and individualized high school 
experience. We meet this goal through our highly individualized advisory program. Advisory at Cambria Heights 
Academy has the following three purposes: 

1) to support students’ social-emotional health 

2) to support students’ academic success in high school and promote early college awareness  

3) to come together under a unifying theme that contributes to the betterment of our school, i.e., Spirit Club, 
Welcoming Committee, etc. 

Each faculty member serves as advisor to a group of 15-20 students. The faculty member serves as advocate, guide, 
and mentor for his/her advisees. In two weekly meetings, advisors lead community-building activities, facilitate 
school-wide initiatives, and provide one-on-one guidance to advisees. All advisors schedule and hold parent-teacher 
conferences twice per year, once in the fall and once in the spring. Advisors function as a knowledgeable 
representative of their grade level team during these parent/guardian conferences. All advisories are responsible for 
signing up to present at least one initiative (to the school community) during community meeting. 

 

(SEP) Software Engineering Program & Digital Art/Graphic Design Program:  
During the 2013-2014 school year, Cambria Heights Academy was accepted into the NYC DOE Software Engineering 
Pilot Program (now Computer Science for All). The Software Engineering (SEP) course sequence provides an 
introduction to concepts in computer science. Students begin the year working with Scratch, a visual programming 
environment. As the year progresses, students use HTML and CSS for web production; Lego Mindstorms for robotics; 
Arduino and LilyPad for electronics; and App Inventor for experimenting with mobile app production. The students 
learn coding (Processing), web production, Mobile Development (with Touch Develop), and Data (databases and 
networking). This course sequence places a heavy emphasis on creative problem solving and students are expected to 
work both independently and collaboratively to come up with solutions to a variety of problems. Students keep 
design notebooks and a digital portfolio in which they plan and reflect on their projects. Their portfolios are started 
freshmen year and added to every year until they graduate. This program will grant our students the opportunity to 
earn a CTE certificate in addition to a high school diploma starting with the current senior class, the Class of 2018. Part 
of earning the CTE certificate includes a portfolio evaluation.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

 

INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (REQUIRED 11-12) 
Internship placements are with our partnership organizations and occur outside of our school building in the 
community in which we reside. Some of our current partnerships include Helping Hand Daycare, NYPD Career 
Explorers, New York Police Athletic League (PAL), Hillside Manor, Haitian Americans United for Progress, Farmers 
Blvd Development Corp, Afrikan Poetry Theater, and additional CBO's throughout New York City. Internships not 
only prepare students for on-the-job training in the “real world” but also help our students network for their future 
careers. All qualifying students travel to their off-site placement after school during the week. Students must exhibit 
great independence, responsibility, reliability, and their parent’s/guardian’s permission in order to stay in the 
program. The Cambria Heights Academy Internship Program is for current juniors and seniors in good academic 
standing. Students must have taken and passed all course requirements in order to be eligible for our internship 
program. Students also must take and pass the internship training and orientation training course with a 3 or above in 
order to interview for a prospective internship placement.  

 

COLLEGE NOW (MUST MEET SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS TO PARTICIPATE) 
Cambria Heights Academy ’s College Now program is for current juniors and seniors in good academic standing. 
Students must score a 75 or higher on the English Regents examination in order to be eligible for a College Now 
course. All students must travel off-site 1-2 times per week, on Saturdays, or during the summer to take College Now 
courses at York College. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

Our students come to us from a variety of backgrounds and academic experiences. Since the shift to the Common 
Core assessments in middle school, more than 95% of our incoming ninth-grade students score below grade level on 
the state-wide middle school math and English assessments. Additionally, 17% of our student population has special 
needs either in the form of a learning or an emotional disability and 10% of our student population are new 
immigrants and are English. Language Learners (ELLs) Finally, each year approximately 75% of our population is 
eligible for free or reduced lunch (Title 1). 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

At CHA, the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools are built into the fabric of our school culture. Our 
school-wide instructional goal is to increase the rigor in our classroom instruction by focusing on the three 
components of Domain 3 of the Danielson Framework for Teaching.  

We received a well-developed in the area of school culture (1.4 & 3.4) and professional collaborations (4.2) on our 
2017-18 School Quality Review, and we will continue to work to sustain those areas of celebration this year.  

Our administration team will continue to provide timely feedback to our teachers in order to support their practice 
and develop their areas for growth. We are also very proud to mention that we exceeded the city-wide average when 
it came to strong family and community ties on the NYC School Survey last year. We will continue to work on building 
a community of trust amongst all our stakeholders, i.e., students, parents, teachers, support staff, and community 
partnerships, through the many different traditions we take part in during and outside of the school day. 

Lastly, Some of our strengths and accomplishments are highlighted below: 

· The integration of meaningful technology use across core disciplines, i.e., English, social studies, and science: All

projects through Drive. Teachers submit their feedback through Drive and students revise their work based on this 
feedback. All teacher feedback and student revisions are tracked in Drive. 

· A robust digital art elective program: Students can select courses such as Graphic Design, Digital Media, 3D 
Sculpture, Digital Music, and Video. This enables students to enroll in art courses beyond the two credit art 
requirement for graduation. 

· Investing our money into digital resources for students: We have a one-to-one laptop to student ratio in the 
classrooms and have successfully implemented a laptop lending program for three consecutive years. 

· 86% graduation rate: Our first graduating class achieved an 80% percent graduation rate and our valedictorian 
received a full scholarship to Columbia University. During the 2016-17 school year we achieve an 86% graduation rate. 
We are currently working our way towards earning a 90% graduation rate with our current cohort of students. 

We consistently place great emphasis on strengthening our teacher teams in order to improve student achievement. 
We set aside per session for team leaders to meet with them regularly in order to develop their teacher leadership 
skills. We implement a “teaming” protocol based on The Power of Teacher Teams , a book by Vivian Troen and 
Katherine C. Boles. Every year, teams are charged with creating yearlong goals and are held accountable for those 
goals at the end of the year.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 

Since the shift to the Common Core assessments in middle school, more than 95% of our incoming 
ninth-grade students score below grade level on the state-wide middle school math and English 
assessments. Additionally, approximately 17% of our student population has special needs either 
in the form of a learning or an emotional disability and 10% of our student population are new 
immigrants and are beginners in English. However, in spite of these statistics, according to our 
School Quality Snapshot, we have an 86% high school graduation rate, an 80% graduation rate 
for ELLs, and a 68% graduation rate for students with disabilities. 
 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
 

By June 2019, teachers will revise CCLS tasks which will result in every subject area and grade level, 90% of students 
will complete two Common Core performance tasks designed to meet the Common Core standards.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
On our 2017-18 Quality Review, we received a well-developed in 1.4 and 3.4, School Culture. It was one of our areas 
of celebration, and we credit this to our rich advisory program. However, we are forever working towards ensuring a 
safe and supportive environment that promotes student learning. Thus, teachers, staff, and administration will 
continue to create a positive school climate and culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their 
peers through a student-centered and self-selected advisory program. Our AP in charge of student services and our 
guidance counselor will create a mandated advisory curriculum that focuses on anti-bullying, anti-discrimination, 
acceptance and tolerance lesson plans. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Based on our results of our School Quality Snapshot, and an effort to increase positive feelings around school safety, 
our goal is to increase our students overall feelings of safety by 5% this year. We will see this outcome measured on 
the next School Quality Snapshot. 

In addition, our AP in charge of student services and our guidance counselor will conduct two surveys of students and 
teachers to assess how teachers and students are feeling regarding the advisory curriculum and to assess how 
comfortable students are feeling in the school and the surrounding area.

your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including:

SIFE, STH). 

 

All faculty, including administration, lead an advisory class of 15-
20 students. Cambria Heights Academy Advisors are our 
students’ families primary point of contact.  

 

Faculty think up three possible themes for an advisory that help 
build a positive school culture and climate. Students select and 
receive one of their top three advisory choices through an initial 
student-interest survey. Through these theme-based advisories, 
students create school programs and events that help build a 
positive school culture and climate at Cambria Heights Academy

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly.

2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Every year since our founding year in 2010, our teachers have participated in school-wide professional development 
on a weekly basis. It is during this time that our teachers reflect on their strengths and weakness, collaborate with 
their colleagues, create their curriculum maps, and analyze student progress. Teachers value this time, and at our 
school, our teachers agree that we place a huge emphasis on the the importance of effective instruction. On the 
2017-18 Quality Review we scored a well-developed on 4.2, teacher collaboration. Additionally, teacher collaboration 
was one of our strengths on the 2017-18 NYC School Survey as well. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, all teacher leaders will meet weekly during the school day during the Principal's Cabinet meetings. We 
will discuss and develop the PD Calendar and split up into groups to co-plan and co-facilitate PD which will result in 
teacher collaboration and a positive response of 80% or higher on the NYC School Survey.

Last year, 85% of our teachers were rated Effective on the Danielson rubric with only 15% scoring below that. 
However, when analyzing the teachers’ individual ratings according to the Danielson, we found that while very strong 
overall in Domain 2 (The Classroom Environment), our school needs to work with teachers to improve their practice 
overall in Domain 3. Thus, we decided to focus on Domain 3 as a school-wide goal with our teachers. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the

and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, 90% our teachers will have received effective or highly effective ratings on the Danielson rubric. In 
addition, 100% of our teachers will have engaged in at least two intervisitation cycles with their colleagues, during 
which they will have engaged in giving and receiving actionable feedback.

According to the School Quality Snapshot, 95% of the families surveyed are satisfied with the education that their 
child has received at Cambria Heights Academy. We are proud of that percentage and aim to maintain or increase it 
this year. We attribute most of our success to our Parent Coordinator who aims to address all our parents’ needs and 
concerns within 24 hours. In addition, our Parent Coordinator is an active presence during PTA Executive Board 
planning meetings and monthly PTA meetings. She recruits different teachers each month to make presentations 
about their curriculum, Common Core performance tasks, and other major projects.  

Also, all families have a free Skedula/Pupilpath account (our online teacher gradebook) where they can log in to check 
their student’s progress in live time and through which they can email teachers and administrators. Early in the year, 
our technology coordinator facilitates a “Pupilpath Family Night” to help all parents and guardians log in and sign up 
for student progress text messages.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
 

According to the 2017-18 School Survey, more than 85% of our parents are satisfied with the quality of education their 
child receives at Cambria Heights Academy. By June 2019, we aim to maintain or increase the number of families who

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
Teachers co-create common baseline, interim, and final assessments based on Regents/AP Tests/SAT questions in all 
four disciplines. During Professional Development, teacher teams analyze the results from these baselines and use 
them to shape upcoming lessons. Since there is only one teacher per subject area, all other assessments are common 
assessments for the students within that grade level/course. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent

representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 



Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. [Cambria Heights Academy] , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, 
Part A of the ESSA, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the 
connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed 
to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of 
their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and 
Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

[ Cambria Heights Academy ] will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand;

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community; 

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability, 
grade-level curriculum, and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, School Quality Report, Quality Review 
Report, NYC School Survey; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in

the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA); 

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
We use ATS data, all NY State assessments, and a teacher-created baseline in addition to the NYSESLAT/NYSITELL to assess 
students. The data is used to schedule students for remediation and after-school and Saturday School Regents Prep. We also 
use this data to differentiate instruction in the classroom and to provide our ELL teacher with important information that she 
uses to meet the needs of this population.    
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Our School intervention Team (SIT) meets monthly to discuss the needs of our ELLs and to make sure they are programmed 
correctly and receiving the required services. They report their findings to the admin team and adjustments are made if 
necessary.  
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
All subsequent support activities focus on helping students progress in English. We gauge our students success using the 
NYSESLAT/NYSITELL and passing the English Regents with a 65 or higher. After students reach these higher levels of 
proficiency, they are transitioned out of the ELL program. Former ELLs will continue to receive Regents testing 
accommodations such as extra time, testing in a separate location, and use of glossaries and word-to-word dictionaries. This 
will continue for as long as the students need such accommodations, but not more than an additional two years.    
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

The Student Intervention Team (SIT) meets once per month, and they discuss ELL interventions after assessment data has 
been gathered. They ensure that our ELLS are programmed correctly and are receiving the necessary supports. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
n/a    
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Our school has a high level of proficient ELL students (TR, CM) who are fully integrated with the general student body. They 
still benefit from push-in support from the ELL teacher and from testing and extended time supports. In addition, supporting 
beginning and emerging ELLs with the online program Achieve 3000 helps the student move to the next level by the time they 
are juniors and seniors in high school.   
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

In addition to the SIT, we meet weekly for professional development with all faculty and staff. Our school-wide professional 
development calendar includes guidance and support to help all teachers differentiate for ELLs and students with special 
needs. Regular announcements are made to the grade level teams and strategies are discussed and implemented into their 
classrooms. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

We use collaborative team teaching in English, math and social studies. We use a push-in model for all of our ELL 
classes. All students are grouped heterogeneously. Standalone ENL classes are ungraded and integrated ENL classes 
are heterogeneous.  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

n/a    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

n/a   

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

All integrated ESL instructional minutes are delivered through a co-teaching model and the students who require a standalone 
ESL class receive that in addition to the co-taught classes.   
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
The number of ELL students is relatively small at Cambria Heights Academy (less than 10%). We teach our content areas only in 
English and use the collaborative team teaching model in the classes where the ESL teacher pushes in. In addition, all of our 
ELL students are also programmed for enrichment classes in English where they further learn the language in a class designed 
to supplement their content classes. This allows for better modified and individualized instruction within regular education 
classrooms as well as better support of and communication with the families of these students. Because of the small class size 
and individualized instruction, our ELL students are able to meet the CCLS and pass the required Regents exams to graduate.    
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

For this, we contact the translation unit who helps translate our assessments into the various home languages.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

The following protocols are in place for the different ELL sub-groups: 
  
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
We believe in a highly personalized learning environment; therefore, our ELL teacher gets to know our ELLs really well in 
multiple settings. While there is no dedicated text book used in the ELL classes, we use Achieve 3000 with our beginner ELLs. In 
the mainstream classes, the students work with a variety of challenging texts related to many areas of interest, including non-
fiction topics in the social studies and science content areas. Vocabulary building is an integral part of the classes. Students also 
become familiar with the state assessment formats through past exams. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
Our ISS (Special Education) and ELL teachers have common planning time to collaborate and discuss this particular population. 
Our ELL teacher is currently in the process of becoming dually certified in Special Education to better serve this population's 
needs and our Special Education lead is currently working on acquiring her ELL extension. In addition, these students' needs 
are all documented on their IEP's and the SIT team creates a plan that incorporates attaining higher proficiency in English into 
their IEP goals. The Guidance Counselor serves on the SIT team in order to ensure appropriate scheduling for the students with 
IEP's who are also ELLs.  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Our ELL population is small (less than 10% of our students). Thus, our school currently only offers a free-standing ENL program. 
Our three goals for ELLs are 
The range of intervention services are as follows: 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          53 

 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

We are considering increasing the staff support for our ELL population by identifying a teacher who is interested in becoming 
dually certified and supporting him/her with his/her license extension. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

n/a 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
We translate all information that is sent home. In addition, our online gradebook provides translation for non-English speaking 
families. Teachers often mandate our ELLs to meet with them one-on-one after-school for more individual support.   
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
Our teachers have time built into the school day to collaborate. During this time, conferencing between ESL and content area 
teachers regularly takes place. They often discuss strategies to simplify concepts, especially the challenging material in upper 
level math and science. We also have bilingual and word-to-word dictionaries and glossaries in all our content-area 
classrooms. We have a 1:1 student/laptop ratio which helps provide a scaffold for students who might be struggling within a 
content area.   
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In our classrooms, we provide bilingual and word-to-word dictionaries and glossaries and have a 1:1 student/laptop ratio 
which helps provide a scaffold for students who might be struggling within a content area. In our communication with families, 
we translate everything we send home and regularly contact the translation unit to support our ELL families. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

We ensure that the required services and resources support our ELL students by using ATS as a way to correctly identify the 
services our students need. The Guidance Counselor puts forth the recommended program for our students and the 
administration double checks it to ensure all ELLs are receiving the services they require. All content area teachers have 
created curriculum maps based on the CCLS and the ELL teacher makes sure that the ELL students meet those standards.   
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Our teachers have time built into the school day to collaborate. During this time, conferencing between ESL and content area 
teachers regularly takes place. They often discuss strategies to simplify concepts, especially the challenging material in upper 
level math and science. We also have bilingual and word-to-word dictionaries and glossaries in all our content-area 
classrooms. We have a 1:1 student/laptop ratio which helps provide a scaffold for students who might be struggling within a 
content area.   
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
•     Use of bilingual and ESL dictionaries and glossaries in the content-area classrooms  
•     Extended time opportunities for students for classwork, tests, and other as needed 
•     One-on-one tutoring after-school with content area teachers 
•     Conferencing with ELLs in and out of classroom 
•     After-school and before-school ELL enrichment programs, Regents Prep and Saturday School     
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Spanish and Mandarin are offered as electives at Cambria Heights Academy.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

n/a    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our ELL personnel are trained in our after-school weekly professional development on Monday afternoons. Here, we focus on 
adapting materials and pedagogy to Common Core Learning Standards. The staff is further supported through grade teams and 
subject teams and co-planning, with time allocated in the day for the collaborative work. 
CHA PD for teachers is provided by the administrative staff as well through Affinity and the Borough Support Centers. 
Within the school, professional development concentrates on the CCSS and supporting ELLs by:   
• understanding the current literacy levels of the ELL students.   
• scaffolding instruction in Math and Science through experiments and the use of manipulatives.  
• learning how to strategically integrate technology in the content areas.   
• differentiating instruction as a general rule but especially with ELLs.   
• How to use periodic assessment data to support ELLs learning. 
• Item analysis and use of data to inform instruction.      
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
We provide all students with a freshmen orientation week that helps all our students acclimate to high school. We go over 
school-wide procedures and routines and the students work on a creative writing project. This helps all of our students, ELLs 
and non-ELLs, with their writing and gives the teachers a better understanding of their current writing levels. 
 
We create a PD calendar that takes this regulation into consideration in the planning of the PD for the year. We have no 
trouble meeting this requirement and all agendas are kept electronically. In addition, we send our ELL teacher out of the 
building to external PD to help meet this requirement.    
 
 

 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Parent volunteers are encouraged to spend time and assist in school.   Parental involvement workshops held 4 times a year 
with discussions around transcript review, promotion and graduation requirements, etc. These workshops include parents of 
ELLs and are supported by the SLT and the PTA.   At our monthly PTA meetings we provide on site translation services.       

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          55 

 

 

ELL parent involvement is strong as they attend PTA meetings, Open School Conferences, and walk-in to meet with the Parent 
Coordinator when the need arises. Translation is never an issue because chances are one of our staff members speaks the 
home language. All parents are clear about this and are informed about the person they should contact for specific translation 
needs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Melissa Menake, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

At the beginning of each school year, families who are new to the DOE are administered the NYCDOE Home 
Language Survey and they record their preferred communication language. According to ATS Reports, 
approximately 11% of the school population has parents/guardians that prefer to be communicated with in a 
language other than English. Emergency Contact cards are used to help identify the specific languages of 
parents/guardians, as well as in-person questionnaires and surveys and phone conversations. All information is 
recorded in a spreadsheet which is shared with school personnel. In addition, we use the program Kinvolved 
which automatically translates all communication in multiple languages to and from the home. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the case of an emergency, a staff member that is able to communicate in the home language will be asked to 
communicate with parent and/or guardian. We have at least one staff member who speaks the preferred language 
of each of our families.  

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During staff professional development sessions, staff are informed of effective methods of communicating with 
parents/guardians whose preferred language is other than English concerning student progress.

  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

In September parents/guardians receive a family handbook containing grading policies, behavioral expectations, 
and services available for students. A translated version of the family handbook is provided along with the 
informational brochure about the services provided by the T & I Unit and instructions on how to obtain an 
interpreter. 

 

Within the school multilingual welcome posters are posted and all NYCDOE documents are displayed with 
translated versions provided. 

 

During advisory periods advisors distribute the Language Identification Guide to determine the language spoken by 
a parent, and translators are made available for parents that prefer to communicate in languages other than 
English. 

 

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

During each parent teacher conference (October, March, and May) parents complete a survey to rate the 
effectiveness of communication throughout the year.
