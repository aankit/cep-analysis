Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

PS 19’s Mission Statement - We, the Judith K. Weiss-Woodlawn School community, are dedicated to fostering a 
partnership between the home, the school and the community. We are committed to the child by providing a 
nurturing, stimulating environment that maintains high expectations for all students. In order to achieve this, we will 
promote learning, develop dignity, self-esteem and mutual respect. Moreover, we will provide opportunities to 
develop critical thinking skills and the skills necessary for decision making and problem solving. Our overall goal is to 
enable students to become responsible citizens in a multicultural society.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

The essence of the PS 19 community is found in the strength of its families. Parents continue to be involved in their 
children’s education, both within school and outside of the school day, and PS 19 can be considered a central hub for 
community involvement. The Parents’ Association, along with PS 19’s Student Union, conducted various activities 
such as food drives, Toys for Tots, and clothing drives designed to support those in the community who need 
assistance. Students actively collected food, pennies for our Penny Harvest, and Box Tops’. Our students were given 
many opportunities to become active community members as they learned about their civic responsibilities. In 2017-
178PS 19 continued its partnership with the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center to create an after school 
program available for all students in grades 6-8. Activities included Sports, Art, Yoga, Dance, Science Lab, Interactive 
Gaming, Leadership, Interactive Video, and Lego Robotics as well as other outside events. The COMPASS Program 
provided family support by offering Parent Workshops related to high school choice and by conducting celebrations 
such as a Talent Show for families to attend and enjoy. PS 19 also utilized a grant from City Councilman Andrew Cohen 
from the Bronx Council District 11 and the NYC Department of Cultural Affairs to initiate a CASA after school program 
for students in grades 3-5 on Thursdays and Fridays beginning in January 2018. PS 19 will begin a construction project 
(building addition) that will provide facilities that other schools enjoy (ex. gym , auditorium, library, art and music 
rooms) as well as addressing the severe overcrowding of our current facility. The new building will allow our school to 
provide greater resources and programs to the community. 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

PS 19 is composed of two classes on grade for each grade kindergarten through eighth. Most grades have one ICT 
class and one general education class. Our students with disabilities and our English Language Learners are serviced in 
the most appropriate class on each grade level. Currently our ELL population is consists of 54 students. The largest 
group speaks Albanian, followed closely by Spanish speakers, and Arabic speakers. Additionally, we have students 
whose native languages are Portuguese, Ukrainian, and Greek. PS 19 had 16 new admits last year (2017-18) of ELL 
students. Our ELL students receive the services of one full time instructor and one part-time instructor. Students are 
grouped heterogeneously and are taught by a staff of 35 teachers. Children are assessed in reading and mathematics 
to determine which children would benefit from academic intervention services and SETSS. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

The elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which PS 19 has made the most progress over the past year 
includes Collaborative Teaching, Learning Environment, and Curriculum. The 2017-18 School Quality Guide Our key 
area of focus this year is Rigorous instruction in that we have determined through the data received on the Spring 
2018 NYS English Language Arts (ELA) exams that the level of student writing is not in line with the student to student 
group discussions that they engage in during instructional time. This disconnect has impacted the writing portion of 
exams and student written responses.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Student Progress on standardized testing is a serious concern and area in need of improvement. While our middle 
school students perform above the city, district, and state average certain grades struggle (Grade 5). The rigorous 
content on the New York State (NYS) English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics exams will be covered in the 
curricula and taught by teachers following the instructional programs recommended by the Department of Education 
and will be supplemented as needed, better preparing our students for the NYS exams. Teachers will continue to plan 
collaboratively on subject, and grade levels to provide lessons that will result in higher student performance. School 
leaders will continue to support staff by providing multiple opportunities for professional development and fostering 
strong collaborations amongst the staff. The administration and teachers will provide appropriate support and 
instruction through additional Academic Intervention Services for all students, especially ELL and students with 
Individual Education Plans (IEP’s). On the 2018 NYS Exams, 54.5% of students met standards in ELA. On the 2018 NYS 
mathematics exams, 57.2% of students met the standards.Our Black and Hispanic students scored 38.5% and 50.5% 
levels 3 or 4 respectively in ELA. Females outperformed males 66.5% to 44.8%. On the 2018 NYS Math exams our 
Black and Hispanic students scored at 46.2% and 44.3% respectively. Females outperformed males at 62.2% to 52.6% 
levels 3 and 4. Our ELL students scored a 25.7 % rate for students attaining level 3 and 4 for the 2018 NYS Math 
exams. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, all grade 3-8 teachers instructing ELA will implement targeted instructional writing strategies that will 
result in a 3 percentage point increase of the students scoring at or above proficiency level (level 3 & 4) as measured by 
the NYS ELA assessments.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
The Framework For Great Schools Report 2017-18 provided several insights into how our students perceive PS 19's 
Supportive Environment. The information was obtained from the 2017-18 NYC School Survey. In the 2017-18 School 
Quality Guide PS 19 scored well in the Social-Emotional component of the survey. However, there were some areas of 
concern identified:  

- In the area of "Personal Attention and Support" only 59% of PS 19's middle school students responded positively 
that their teachers support them when they are upset. 

- 53% of our Middle School students say that students rarely or never harass, bully, or intimidate other students at 
their school.  

We see a need to address the perception of our middle school students that our school environment does not offer 
the supports that were asked in the NYC School Survey. We have investigated ways to improve the environment. 
Through the use of student Advisories we hope to accomplish 4 goals:   

  ensure than each student is known well at school by at least one adult who is that youngster's advocate 

(adviser); 
guarantee that every student belongs to a peer group; 

 
  help every student find ways of being successful within the academic and social options the school provides; 
  promote communication and coordination between home and school. 

 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
If the staff supports and participates in the introduction of student advisories that provide a safe and supportive 
environment for their 6-8 grade students which will foster an engaging learning experience within the PS 19 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          15

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017-18 Principal Performance Review (PPR)Quality indicated a Proficient rating on Quality indicator 4.2 – PS 19 
for Teacher Teams and Leadership Development. The findings for this indicator revealed that PS 19 had placed a very 
high value on teacher teams as a catalyst for improving instruction and pedagogy. Teacher teams consistently 
analyzed assessment data and student work, and made adjustments to the curricula. The findings also indicted that 
distributive leadership structures are embedded in school practice. 

By looking at these two indicators it is apparent that we need to continue addressing our pedagogical practices 
aligned to the curricula and reflect on the school's belief of how students learn best.we need to strengthen and 
support our teachers use of questioning strategies, scaffolds, and multiple entry points so that all learners are 
challenged. Our goal is to be Well Developed in the PPR Indicator 4.2. We can utilize the teacher teams to refocus our 
efforts to address entry points and differentiation within the classroom. Teachers that have been identified as 
successful based on classroom observations will be team leaders. They will share best practices and demo lessons 
(classroom inter-visitations) related to Danielson’s components.  

By reviewing our ADVANCE dashboard and the 2017- 18 MOTP summary report, the observations of teachers practice 
indicate that our teachers are secure in Domain 2 but are inconsistent in the ratings for Domain 3. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, teacher teams will engage weekly in professional development to improve instructional techniques 
including strategies to provide students multiple entry points and greater opportunities to engage the students in higher 
order thinking skills. This will be evidenced by a 3 percentage point increase in the number of rated teachers in the 
Highly Effective category” in Domain 3.

Funding was set aside for 2018-19 school year ( School and PTA funds) to increase it's use the IO Education -SKEDULA 
program so that more parents are accessing the program to obtain up to the minute information about their child's 
progress. The administrators, parent coordinator and several staff members will run workshops demonstrating how to 
access and use the program which currently has not reached the level anticipated for the last school year. This tool 
will help the parent and teacher communicate quickly and easily on academic issues. The workshops and information 
meetings will coincide with the September parent-teacher evening as well as the November meeting. Other 
workshops will be held throughout the year as needed depending on the level of parent access to SKEDULA. The 
administrators and technology teacher will monitor the interface levels.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

In the most recent Principal Performance review PPR (2017-18) the QR Component 2.2. (Assessment) was identified 
as an area of focus. The feedback from the reviewer indicated that while the school uses a number of assessment 
data to comprise their student leveled groups, more attention needs to be paid toward assessing students while the 
classroom lesson takes place. The reviewer indicted that the administration should seek support from the ADVANCE 
Team and establish calibration visits with the Assistant Principals and the principal that will promote more feedback 
to the teachers as well as time frames and deadlines in which all stakeholders will be held accountable toward. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Effective School Leadership. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, school leaders will support teachers by using the Danielson Framework for Teaching by providing 
effective time bound feedback as evidenced by a 3% increase of the number of teachers rated highly effective in 
Component 3d n (Using Assessment in Instruction) compared to their 2017-18 End Of Year (EOY) ratings.

Section 5E – Framework for Great Schools Element – Strong Family and Community Ties: The school creates a 
welcoming environment for families and takes advantage of community resources to enrich the civic life of the school. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc.

1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

The 2017 -18School Quality Guide revealed a lower than anticipated score in outreach to parents. There is a priority 
need to improve strong family and community ties. In the 2017-18 school year the four Parent-Teacher conferences 
were well attended, however the Tuesday afternoon parent contact time was underutilized and did not support 
growth in addressing this need. There is a need to increase the attendance and involvement of the parents at all 
school functions as well as the attendance and involvement with the PTA. We believe that by increasing the amount 
of opportunities to engage the parents we will become highly effective in family and community engagement which in 
turn will support student achievement. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June of 2019, there will be a 10% increase in the number of parent/guardian teacher conferences in the Tuesday 
afternoon Teacher-Parent time compared to the attendance sheets/phone logs for the 2017-18 school year.

4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34 

 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy.

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.

P.S. 19 is a K-8 community school that has an enrollment 521 students. ELL students making up 
10.4% (54 students) of the population.  There are 2 classes on a grade with ENL students 
serviced by a Freestanding ESL programs.     A total of  47 (9.2%) current students were 
administered the 2017 NYSESLAT resulting in 18 test takers advancing 1 to 2 
proficiency levels, 16 test takers remaining at the same proficiency rating and 0 regressing. 
Modalities of strength for the school is in the speaking with gains in writing which aligning to 
the instructional focus for the ENL students and the prior 17/18 program.  In looking at the 
School Quality Report 16/17, the overall school had an increase of ELA proficiency level of 3.34 
and ENL had a 2.73 proficiency level. There was a decrease in level 1 performance in 
ELA( 7.6%) for our ENL students. Unlike the previous year where there was a decrease in the 
ENL performance average proficiency from a 2.25 to a 2.21 in ELA.  In math the overall school 
had a 3.3% performance level gain but the ENL students had an overall decrease of 12.1% with a 
13.3% increase in level 1.The previous year also mirrored loss for our ENL students Math went 
from a 2.63 to 2.42 average proficiency The school two prominent areas of concern is the 
students who are not progressing on the NYSESLAT and the drops in ENL math performance.  
Between the two academic years, several changes were made to the ELA curriculum with a focus 
on reading complex text and increase in non fiction reading.  This limited student access to 
reading books appropriate to his or her level.  Several of the students had difficulty with the non 
fiction text with limited background knowledge or vocabulary knowledge to have success with 
the class selected text.  In looking at overall performance and success in programs, we also 
looked at other forms of assessment (ELA state exams, Performance Assessments, Fountas & 
Pinnells & Math state exams). This supported us in identifying several target grades for the 
supplemental program.   Lastly, alongside language acquisition, prior knowledge is extremely 
relevant to learning.  Our ENL students have limited exposure to several concepts need to 
comprehend non fiction text or limited opportunities to develop their speaking and listening 
modalities in the classroom.  Additionally, we found that books offered did not culturally relate 
or were sensitive to our ENL population. 
 
 
 
Subgroups and Grade Level 
 
The morning Title III program will look to address the needs of students in grades 1-7 at all 
proficiency levels with reading non fiction as part of the instructional focus.  The class will be 
offered to a total of  current ENL students.  One lIcensed ESL teacher will work with the 1 - 4 
grade span, content area teacher will work with 5 -8 grade span. Additionally, we will add a math

Attendance will be taken at each session by the teacher and recorded in SKEDULA, our online 
data system, along with a binder where students will sign in upon arrival.  Parents will be 
notified on school letter head about the program in their preferred language.  Tear- offs signed by 
the parent will be required for attendance to the program.  Lastly, parent coordinator will 
outreach using the interpretation service by phone for families that do not reply to the 
applications for attendance to the TITLE III program. On the tear-off we will request an email or 
contact number so we can add to school messenger for updates and reminders concerning the 
program at the requested home language.  
 
Program Overview 
In order to address our student’s needs, our goal is to create a program that supports the 
instruction during the day but is geared towards ELL students. The program that we will be 
implementing will be based on a theme approach in learning reading using non fiction text along 
with a math focus day.  Two ENL teachers will provide the instruction to students range from 
grades 1-8. Students will be places based on data from the NYSESLAT and 
NYC/NYS assessments.  Professional Development will be offered to the staff.  Staff will be 
offered 4 professional development session aligning with the instructional focus of the program- 
reading non fiction text and building math concepts.  We will utilize, Language Power, as a tool 
to address all five modalities with an emphasis on reading and writing. Language Power is an 
English language development program that builds students’ background knowledge around 
relevant content-area topics and themes; engages students in meaningful language experiences 
with structured, comprehensible input and output; and provides students with an authentic 
purpose for learning academic language functions and forms. The program and lessons will be 
systematically structured to differentiate for students’ language proficiency levels, and scaffold 
the acquisition of the language objectives. Instruction will be provided in a risk free atmosphere 
providing groups of students with meaningful language experiences through the use of thematic 
text sets that are based on common curriculum themes. As research shows, English language 
learners benefit from a thematic approach to learning because when students can connect 
learning to a larger context, it makes the information more meaningful (Haas 2000). In each 
theme, students will have multiple exposures to vocabulary and language structures and receive 
varied opportunities to use the language in context and across the curriculum. Additionally, these 
themes build students’ background around content-area standards supporting their academic 
achievement in other curricular areas.

Rationale: Based on teacher surveys that were completed in , 83% of the staff requested 
professional development around using ESL methodology.  In addition several of our ELA 
programs were evaluated based on the strategies provided to ensure access for all 
students.  Although our current ELA and math curriculum do offer supports, they are generic and 
do not provide a classroom teacher with the understanding to utilize the  tools and strategies they 
can provide to the ELL students to enhance learning. While curriculum planning for 2017-2018, 
teachers felt unsure on how to support the ENL students but thoughtfully revised units of study 
to reflect students' interest and ability levels with book clubs become a core protocol in the 
classrooms.   Lastly, based on Advance data from formal and informal 
observations,  teachers  provided limited points of entry for ELL students.  
 
As part of our Professional Learning Plan, teachers’ school wide will receive differentiated 
training during the weekly sessions on Monday.  School wide we have teachers working in teams 
in researching and developing action plans to support student learning.  In looking at the PS 19 
Professional Learning Plan,   Teacher will also be able to register to attend PD provided by the 
BFSC. As recipients of the DELLSS EBlast , we have signed up to receive notifications of 
upcoming events during a New York City Department of Education, Department of English 
Language Learners and Student Support professional development session or activity.   All 
Teachers are encouraged to attend workshops at no cost to Title III funding. Protocol is to notify 
administration of the workshop and dates.  Once approved teachers will self register.  ESL 
teachers will attend a minimum of 2 self selected workshops provided by the DELLSS and/or 
BFSC. Two teacher will be designated the ESL liasion and attend the monthly meetings at the 
BFSC for the 2018-2019 school year.  ESL teachers are then required to present to staff during a 
grade conference. In addition, we have a teacher team consisting of Special Education, General 
Education and ENL teacher attending a workshop series looking at ways to successfully 
implement the integrated model for our ENL instruction.  Lastly, we will look at the Spring 
BFSC calendar when made available to send common branch teachers.

Title III PD Activities: In house PD will be provided by Todd Wagner and Spheresa Gjidija 
about how the Title III program will further support student learning. This professional 
development will be offered for teachers in grades k through 8 for a total of 7 participants and 1 
facilitator.  In house PD will discuss the language acquisition process for our ELLs.  Firstly,  we 
will look at understanding where they are in language acquisition based on the NYSESLAT.  PD 
will look at areas of strengths and areas in need.  The second session will discuss how the 
program is being implement to support ENL in math that will  align to our current curriculum.  It 
will address specific reading strategies across content area for ELLs. A PD will be provided on 
how to provide multiple entry points in ELA, SS and science instruction.  Last session, staff will 
then look at how to plan and support ENL accordingly in day to day instruction.  All participants 
will be required to attend all 3 sessions and turn key during the grade collaboration meeting. As a 
school we have only two classes on a grade allowing for frequent collaboration.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
 Our goal is to improve all student achievement through a balanced approach to literacy, mathematics 
and mastery of content areas. Assessment tools are utilized in planning our instruction for differentiation. Students are 
assessed using both formative and summative assessments- the LAB-R test, NYSESLAT, Fountas & Pinnell, Performance 
Assessments, chapter test, Exit Slips, writing samples, I-Ready, Performance assessments in core content areas, conferences 
and teacher observations.  Four times a year K - 3 are tested on the Fountas and Pinnell Benchmark assessments. In 
September the data provides us with areas of strength and areas of needed improvement for students in concepts of print, 
letter sound id, fluency, sight words and comprehension.  This gives us an idea on what skill we need to work with in order for 
the student to make progress. These assessment help us target our instruction and through continuous monitoring we are able 
to look at gains and formulate next steps. One focus from the prior and upcoming year is to utilize formative assessments daily

in the classrooms. All teachers are required to keep a monthly calendar displaying reading groups and individual 
conferences.  Teachers then use a log that is used to record the informal data and set individual goals for the student. lastly, 
we have looked at and will continue to look at formative assessments for daily lessons. We now utilize lesson check in and exit 
slips daily to endure student understand and make instructional decisions for  all students.  Here we can immediately address 
student needs versus waiting until the end of a unit of chapter for the re-teach.  
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Teachers are provided with a progress monitoring calendar at the beginning of the school year outlining all 
summative assessments for the year. We also produce a monthly newsletter with a section on assessments for the 
teachers.  In the 16/17 8 teachers attended PD offered by the BFSC in using assessment. The teachers then turn -keyed this to 
staff during the PLCs on Monday.  We also created a resource on One Drive where teachers can go to find assessment tools to 
use during lessons, We have scheduled into our PLC time a block to look at the formative assessments, teaching strategy used 
to address the need and the follow up results.  
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
 Success of our program is evaluated in several aspects.  Firstly, we look at the emotional and social aspect of how a student 
and family acclimates to our school. We monitor for the development of friendships, participation in class, and extra curricular 
activities.  In addition, we look to see families attendance at parent workshops, Tuesday parent engagement day, class 
celebrations, and parent teacher conferences. We are committed to welcoming and including the different ethnic 
communities of our ELL parents and 
students in all school activities.   
  In addition, we monitor students academic progress in school.  Each year we look at the results from the NYSESLAT and 
compare to  prior year for AYP.  We look at individual students, ELL levels and across grades.  In addition we look at our yearly 
school wide assessments such as the Fountas and Pinnell levels, chapter and unit test in math, and online assessment- I -
Ready.  We look at the results of the NYSESLAT from the previous year,  NYTL for newcomers,  and compare them to current 
year NYSESLAT/ NYSITELL.   We  monitor data to see how the students advance through the levels of language proficiency.  The 
16/17 school year really utilized the NYC Performance tasks in all content area and for ELL students. WE targeted specific 
CCLS standards that were need for groups of students and restructured curriculum or teaching instruction.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

In June of the prior year, a list of target students is created based on the end of the year assessments and reviewed in 
September. This list is provide to future teachers in June along with an updated one in September. At P.S. 19 our RTI team 
meets bi weekly to look at school wide data from several formative and  summative assessments. Each teacher is asked to 
identify at risks students and implement a Tier II program within the classroom.  For example, in grade 2 a teacher might meet 
with a particular reading group 2-3 times a week, if a child is targeted his/j=her group will meet at a minimum of 4 times a 
week. Teacher is then asked to progress monitor weekly and the team looks at the data. Depending on the individual student 
growth or lack of the student may them be targeted for  a Tier III intervention. Students are placed in the instructional 
programs for 6 to 8 weeks and reviewed by the team using the progress monitoring tools designed for the programs.  
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
 In September, our PLC groups work across grades analyzing data from several sources like the NYSESLAT and state exams 
along with the end of the year content area assessments. Particular students are targeted at risks and an instructional plan is 
created for them within the classroom. Teacher teams then look at student work from the instruction plan.  Here we look at 
areas of growth and areas that still need improvement. The goal is to tailor the instruction to meet the needs of the student, 
instead of pulling them out for a restrictive program.This might look like two to  three additional strategy reading lessons for a 
targeted group of students in the classroom.  This is our first level of RTI.  
 
In addition, we have created a RTI team that meets bi-weekly.  Here classroom teachers and content area teachers present a 
student that they have academic concerns. Students are presented to the team  regardless of other services he/she are being 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

 

provided.  A long and short term plan is devised for the student and shared with the teacher and parent. When necessary 
students will receive AIS for an extended period(6-8) weeks based on the plan.  The AIS teacher is required to progress monitor 
the student and report back to the team 3 times a cycle.  At the end of the cycle (6-8) weeks the child is discussed again to look 
whether their was progress or a need for continuation of AIS.     
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
The data patterns across the proficiency levels in the NYSITELL and NYSESLAT show that students tend to have the most 
difficulty in the reading and writing modalities with overall strengths in listening and speaking. Speaking has always been an 
area of strength for our ELL students and will continue with past practices during instruction that enhanced student learning 
(partnerships, repetition, use of technology, and book clubs) .  In looking at the number of NYSESLAT test takers and the 
modalities of need it is apparent that writing is an area in need for k-8. Students identified as entering and emerging have not 
demonstrated strong control over common sentence patterns, coordination, spelling and mechanics. In looking at the 2016, 
ELA in the short and extended response the trend was that students, especially ENL students, scored lower than their peers.  
In looking at the NYSESLAT, of the 37 tested in the 15/16 year, 19 students remained at the same level. 8 students advanced 
one proficiency level, 0 students regressed 1 proficiency level and 1 regressed 2 proficiency levels.  
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

OUr ENL Team distributes the data to all teachers  and families in  in September.  The data is then reviewed as a team during 
grade meetings and the PLC. In looking at the data instructional decisions and curriculum is modified to meet the needs of the 
students.  In addition, lesson and unit plans will be adjusted to meet the needs of the ENL population. The work is done in 
collaboration with the ENL teachers and the content area teacher.   

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

 Instruction for ELLs will be delivered in the ESL/ENL Program Model. There are two components to this program the 
standalone ENL units and the Integrated ENL units. Our school has chosen to implement the Collaborative Teaching 
Model for the Integrated ENL units. There are presently two classes on a grade at PS 19 The students have been 
grouped heterogeneously and are not in any of the Integrated Co-teaching classes. The ESL Teachers Ms. Gjidija and 
Mr. Wagner,  will provide Integrated Push-in ELA/ENL service in these classrooms for the mandated amount of 
minutes. Stand Alone ENL Service will be provided in the ESL rooms of Ms. Gjidija for grades . This will be a total 
of  students for the 17/18 school year. For our  4 students with IEPs, they are placed in an ICT class and will receive 
the integrated ENL units in the neighboring classroom.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Not applicable 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

Not applicable 

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          49 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

            The Assistant Principal  is responsible for ensuring that the mandated number of instructional minutes are provided 
according to students’ proficiency levels. Schedules are created for the ESL teachers and then reviewed collaboratively. All ESL 
teachers' schedules are kept on file in main office and reviewed monthly to make revisions as necessary due to incoming 
enrollment. In the event of a large increase of ENLs, the Principal will be notified of the need for additional ENL service 
providers. Lastly, all class are programmed into STARS classroom outlining the mandates.  
2a. PS 19 has planned the ENL units of study to simplify scheduling for our ESL teachers. Entering and Emerging students will 
receive 1unit of Stand-Alone ENL Instruction. Entering, Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding students will receive 1 unit of 
Integrated ENL/ELA service through the Push-In Collaborative Teaching Model for ELA. Commanding ELLs have been placed in 
ELL classes and will receive .5 units of Integrated ENL/ELA .5 units a week. ELLs with IEPs will receive their mandated units in 
the neighboring classroom.   Teachers schedules were created across the grades to ensure that the student received the ESL 
service and did not conflict with their IEP recommended program. 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
      All content area is delivered in an instructional program that ensures academic rigor. In addition to our 90 minute ELA and 
math block,all students at P.S. 19 receive instruction in science, social studies, technology and the the arts. Each classroom has 
a leveled library for students to utilize. This year all classes will be following the Teachers' College Unit of Study with 
modification based on needs, such as guided reading and strategy groups. .   Kindergarten to 8th do  labs once a week in the 
classroom. In math we will continue to do a balanced approach to learning using Go Math curriculum as a resource.  Our 
elementary science teacher utilizes ESL strategies for her instruction that have been shared out during grade conferences and 
professional development. Students are guided in small groups the work on language development both verbal and written. 
We also provide laptops/ipads to our newcomer students in ELA, science, math, and social studies. Here the textbooks are 
available online along with a website tutorials that support the content. As a staff we really heavily on Google translate for our 
middle school newcomers and all learners.Unfortunately, several languages are not available in the textbooks or trade books 
and the teacher will summarize/take notes then translate using Google Translate for the students. 
 
Technology is used on a daily basis in our classrooms. Each room is equipped with a smart board where lessons use visual 
support in the content area to support student learning. There is a computer lab for technology classes and lab carts and 
ipad carts for teachers to use.  technology is used by  teachers like Video module to support learning and build background 
knowledge.   In addition to the above support for content area, our K-8 teachers follow the recommended NYC DOE pacing 
calendar for social studies and science. For the 17/18school year we opted into the NYC DOE Social Studies core 
curriculum.  Several trade books, in addition to our core curriculum program from Houghton Mifflin, were purchased for our 
ELL population to support units of study. These trade books are supported with photographs, time lines, maps, and easier 
readability for our ELL students.   During our weekly grade conferences strategies are shared in terms of best practices for our 
ELL. In addition we receive support from our Network Ell Achievement Coach.Weekly experiments are provided school wide 
and the ESL teacher will further support the units of study during her instruction.  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

    Currently our school  only offers an ESL/ENL Program, we do not evaluate students in their home language. If a need arises 
throughout the year to evaluate an ELL in their native language, we will contact the ELL Compliance Leader to find appropriate 
materials to evaluate the student. For State and Local assessment that is available in native language students are provided a 
copy in their native language and English.  During state exams it is necessary to utilize interpretation services for Arabic since 
the NYS Math and Science are not yet translated in this language.   When using the DOE performance assessments from 
Schoolnet in all content areas, translation is available in all languages including Arabic.  Students are provided with the copy in 
the native language and English for the assessment.  
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

a. 

SIFE   

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

 
 
 6.a. When we have SIFE students we focus on instruction that teaches not only academic but social language. Weekly our 
students work with a counselor on study skills and remedial content. They are in a double block of ELA and Math in a team 
teaching model. When we have a SIFE students we also assign a "Buddy" system with a classmate. 
b. Our newcomers in grades 4 and up are using the Keys to Learning program 7 periods a week with a double block on 2 days. 
Our newcomers in elementary are in a balanced literacy program daily for a double period with the support of two teachers. 
We look at building conversation around themes of familiar context like families.  Teacher provides word and letter support in 
English and native language if necessary. The ENL teacher looks at building phonics, phonemic awareness, sight words, 
reading/listening comprehension and fluency. Other programs that we use  based on needs and levels are Fundations, Math 
Steps, Starfall, A+ Math, Backpack, Raz Kids and I Ready!  
.c. During the daily 90 minute Literacy and Math block all ELL students are receiving the support of two teachers in the 
classroom. We have returned to teachers' college units of study for k -8  with modifications as needed such as guided reading 
in a "Take Ten Model".  In math we are using Go Math and CMP3 as an instructional resource but not the sole resources. These 
programs have online tutorial s to support student learning.  Weekly math games  are used to reinforce basic skills along with a 
problem of the day for higher order thinking skills. Math is supported for our ELLs with two teachers using the website and 
small group instruction based on needs in double blocks. Technology is widely used in all classrooms to support all our ELL 
students in all content areas. Each room is equipped with smart board sand digital image projectors to provide visual, auditory, 
and kinesthetic support to our students. Classrooms are set up with laptops  to further the learning modalities of ELA. 
 d. Our long term ELLs are in a heterogeneous classes that have the support of two teachers during the literacy and math 
block. They are receiving the support in writing, an area of weakness for students.  We provide several opportunities 
throughout the year to engage the parents his or her child's learning-orientations, celebrations, progress report meeting, 
report cards, and parent workshops. 
e. Our 4 ELLs with special needs are closely monitored and provided all the academic support. Our related service teachers 
work directly in the classroom with the general education teacher and the ESL teacher. We have weekly special education 
meetings that are attended by all support service providers and our ESL teacher. Here we work on strategies that best support 
our students and analyse the data for instruction. For our special education model, we strongly support an ICT setting. All our 
special need students are in this setting accessing general education with the support of two teachers. Curriculum is not 
altered but modified to best meet the learners needs with multiple entry points. Some modifications are put in to place for 
students maybe time frame, amount of questions, presentation of material, etc. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
 
Teachers across the grades and content areas use a variety of instructional strategies to provide access to academic content 
areas and accelerate English language development. The use of visual presentation is an emphasis for our ELLs-SWDs  which 
can be streamlined through the Smart Board, laptops or I-Pads which are available to all classes. We  use video clips, 
photographs, and readability of text using articles that all pertain to the topic/content being taught. the use of Newsela where 
we can still have students reading the same text but at different lexile levels is used from K - 8.  In addition ELL students are 
partnered with high performing, articulated students who reinforce instruction. Non fiction libraries have been purchased for 
content areas across the grades. Here the teachers work on teaching students strategies to support them as readers during 
guided reading and conferences. Students are encouraged to turn and talk with partners. Accountable talk is present in all 
classes and all content areas. Each class now has new ELA and Math curriculum resources.  For the ELA all students are using 
the same anchor text which is heavily supported by the teacher during a first read (read aloud) students then access the text 
during a second read with partners if necessary  to answer text specific questions.   The program also offers online tutorials 
and supports which students have access to in school.  
  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 

 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 
The school has worked on program that encourages collaboration with the staff. All  teachers are provided  collaboration 
period to work with staff on planning for instruction.This occurs across grades and curriculum. Lesson plans  incorporates ELL 
strategies and differentiation for all learners and shared through OneDrive. In addition to this, we have weekly Special 
Education meetings with all the special ed teachers and service providers.The school has developed curriculum calendars in 
content areas that are constantly being reviewed and revised based on student progress. From K through 8th grade we have 
double blocks daily for literacy and math. Our ELL -SWD are following an ICT model to ensure access to the general education 
curriculum but now have the support of two teachers. This allows teachers to provide small group instruction based on the 
needs of the lesson. In addition, this year our extended day is on two days for longer blocks of 45 minutes to ensure 
consistency and more time on task. All our ELL students are with their peers during the math an literacy block with support of 
another teacher in the room.     
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
: All students that are targeted for intervention attend a 90 minute literacy and math block with the support of two teachers. 
During this block the ESL teacher pushes in for additional support. Each classroom is equipped with a smart board, digital 
image projector and access to a class set of  laptops and i-pads. This provides the tools teachers need to implement ELL 
learning strategies (visual, auditory, etc….)  In our K-3 classes we use Fundations.  For students that have a need they are 
"double dosed" in the program. For grades K - 8 we also use a program called Leveled Intervention for guided reading. This is 
done in addition to the ELA block and is done by our AIS teacher. At 19, we work on matching programs to students not 
students to programs. Steps for our intervention programs range from Tier I to Tier III supports. Lower grade teachers send 
home packets with each student to support class work. Students are assessed formerly monthly and placed in strategic reading 
groups based on needs. Assessments occur throughout the day informally by the teacher conferences, checklist, exit slips, etc. 
We also have bi-weekly RTI meetings that we discuss and monitor the progress of our students. Each grade has collaboration 
periods for data inquiry groups, monitoring student progress and sharing "Best Practices". All students have progress 
monitoring folders that are used to record the data.   
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

This school year we are looking at a more integrated approach.  All ELLs will be engaging in their ELA studies parallel to their 
peers.  We are looking to the continuation of book clubs for student discussion and increase student rigor but most 
importantly to engage in authentic conversations.   Since we have identified writing as an area of need, we are looking at using 
the If Then curriculum to help support our ENLs in writing.  WE have calendared the units of study along with publishing dates 
for all grades.  We are looking at using technology to support the writing process in all classrooms. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

Did not have a bilingual program.  
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
 At PS 19 we are limited in the programs offered to our students .  For the 2017 - 2018 school year we will have an after school 
program for Middle School (MMCC) , test prep, a high school prep course and the CASA art program for lower grades.these 
programs will be open to all our students depending on grade level.  Every child receives an invitation and is encouraged to 
attend.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
  As discussed previously, technology is used to support our ELL during instruction. Each classroom is equipped with a smart 
board and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          52 

 

digital image projector for interactive lessons, visual and auditory support for our students. The school has one state of the art 
computer lab. This year we have purchased an additional 30 laptops that are in carts that can be wheeled into the classroom 
for grades K-3along with IPad (34) cart . Our 4-8 classes also have access to Laptops and IPads which are located on the 3rd 
floor near the classrooms. They are used for various tasks. Student use them to access websites that support language 
acquisition.In math they use them for video clips to support the lesson and the online tutorial if needed.  
 Many of our newcomers use the laptop for the writing process and to assist in translation in Google Translator. Also the 
Smartboards  are used for visual and auditory support for students that provides video components on topics. In addition the 
ESL teachers use the IPADs to access Discovery education that supports learning through videos.    
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

At PS 19, instruction is done in an Freestanding ESL model.  Our largest population of ELLs are Albanian who receive support 
from Ms. Gijidaja who is fluent in Albanian. In addition, Mr. Wagner who also does ESL instruction teaches Spanish to grade 7 
and 8.. Our ESL teachers  are able to support them in native language development (Spanish and Albanian). We also utilize 
Google Translate as a support in the classroom along with translators when available. Students are peered with other students 
who are dual language.  In addition we rely heavily on visual supports through the content libraries and video presentation.  
  
  
   
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

 All required supports and resources are age and grade level appropriate. Due to the fact that we are a K to 8 building we are 
required to purchase various programs which at time might appear inconsistent. Our newcomers in 1st have very different 
needs and awareness than or 8th grades. Our goal is for the students to access the gen-ed curriculum but at times it is 
necessary for students to be pulled out of the instructional classroom.    In planning the program and instruction, we look 
heavily at a students social-emotional factors not just the academic needs.  
 
 Our guidance counselor works closely with our staff in assisting students with the transition to high school. She holds a parent 
workshop twice a year and goes in to the classroom for articulation along with individual student conferences. Students in 7th 
grade begin the high school process by having a weekly class with the guidance counselor.  In addition we have a high school 
fair in October for all students.  The guidance Counselor also has a mandated individual meeting with families for our middle 
school student about the high school process.  All families are required to attend at least one meeting. In addition, the 
two ESL teachers and the guidance counselor schedule tours on selected high schools in NYC that target ENL= New World High 
School.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
  We do not share a building. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
All new families are introduced to our school community including the principal, assistant principals, the parent coordinator, 
health intern, and the pupil accounting secretary. They are given an opportunity to tour the school building and to meet their 
teacher for the upcoming school year.In order to assist newly enrolled ENL students before the beginning of the school year 
we hold an orientation with the parents to familiarize them with PS/MS 19. We offer workshops throughout the school year 
for parents.  In addition, we buddy up our new ENLs with academically successful, articulate students to assist them in the 
school day.  Other support staff that we utilize is our guidance counselor and SAPIS worker as  a person that checks in with the 
students on a daily basis.   Also during the Tuesday parent Engagement time, we schedule a beginning of the year meeting with 
the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher for all families.  
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

 Presently,the language offered at PS/MS 19 is Spanish. Starting in 7th grade students receive Spanish instruction twice a week. 
They continue to have Spanish for 8th and some students are giving the SLP exam.

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
1.  All staff at P.S. 19 participate in a rigorous, professional development plan.Our assistant principals, ENL liaison, and pupil 
personnel secretary, participates in professional development offered by the DOE in regard to training for registration, 
compliance and ATS coding of ENL students. Each grade and teacher has  prep period to ensure collaboration. As a school we 
have a weekly Special Education, RTI, data inquiry, and professional development meeting which we are fortunate to have our 
ENL teacher be apart of the majority of the committees.   
With the support of our district, our ENL teachers receives on site staff development from the ENL specialist and will attend 
District  workshops whenever offered. Our ELL teacher also attends seminars geared towards the ELL population and DOE 
offered workshops. Our teachers of ELL students attend workshops targeted in supporting  our ENL population offered by the 
BFSC.  Teachers this year have had a year long plan to attend PD offered through the BFSC.  We have monthly PD meetings 
where staff turn keys from meetings they have attended.  
  
  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
 Our guidance counselor works closely with our staff in assisting students with the transition to high school. She holds a parent 
workshop twice a year and goes in to the classroom for articulation along with individual student conferences. Students in 7th 
grade begin the high school process by having a weekly class with the guidance counselor.  In addition we have a high school 
fair in October for all students.  The guidance Counselor also has a mandated individual meeting with families for our middle 
school student about the high school process.  All families are required to attend at least one meeting. In addition, the two ESL 
teachers and the guidance counselor schedule tours on selected high schools in NYC that target ENL= New World High 
School.    
    
 All staff have or will obtain the mandated 7.5 hours of ENL training that is recorded. In addition to this we have professional 
development each year that revolves around the instruction of ENLs. Our weekly collaboration meeting with our ESL teacher 
provides support on a continuous cycle for all ENLs. teacher will be offered after school workshops throughout the year on ELL 
training. 
   When teachers attend outside professional development they are required to bring back agendas, a record of attendance 
and turn key to selected staff.  In addition, our PLC had two six week cycles that rotated on ENL specific professional 
development.  Minutes were required to be recorded at the meetings and submitted to administration.  Starting in June 2017, 
all teachers are required to complete a form in OneDrive about the PD that he or she attended. This is then monitored by the 
assistant principal and complied into a spreadsheet.

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Our two ENL teachers  have dedicated her Tuesday to meet with her ELL families.  She sets up a yearly calendar of 
appointments for families. She sits with each family, the student and the classroom teacher.  In addition, she has an open door 
policy that at any time families can come to speak with her. The classroom teachers and content area teachers are in 
attendance at these meetings.   

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

We understand the importance of welcoming new parents into our school community. Our Parent Coordinator and the 
Parents' Association are instrumental in providing school information for new parents, especially parents of ELLs. Our ESL 
teacher, classroom teachers, and all support personnel put forth every effort to ensure that our parents are consistently 
updated regarding student achievement. We have staff members who serve as translators (Albanian, Spanish) for parents 
during meetings, especially Parent-Teacher conferences, phone calls, IEP meetings, High School articulation meetings and for 
any occasion where needed. In addition, we have a school website to enhance communication with all parents where 
Google translator can be implemented. Workshops are planned throughout the school year based on surveys and 
questionnaires. We offer a family math and literacy night yearly for all families. We also host the open school week in 
November, a parent orientation in September for parents, various workshops throughout the school year, and school 
celebrations (publishing celebrations, honor roll, and performances). this year we will also be offering after school workshops 
for ELL parents based on topics received from a parent survey.

Policy and Reference Guide, I, Timothy P. Sullivan, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b.

choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

During enrollment ELL students are identified through the Home Language Survey as outlined in the LAP. The 
information is then input into the ATS system for easy identification of language translation needs. We also send 
home a language preference survey to families which we then provide them all school notices in their language of 
choice. We do this twice a year to ensure that any changes we can accurately update in ATS. The office goes 
through each student emergency card in the beginning of the year to confirm language preferences and 
alignment to ATS.  

In addition, we have our own website that has translated documents and access directly to Google translate for 
parents. All school notifications are uploaded to our webpage- ps19.us. We also use the DOE Translation 
Department to translate important notices and general school information. Additionally, we have staff available 
to to translate as needed-Albanian, Spanish,and Chinese. Our Parent Coordinator works closely and effectively to 
insure that translation needs are met. As new students enroll, the number of families requiring written 
translations fluctuate. As of now, oral interpretation can be provided by a licensed ESL teacher in Spanish and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

Albanian. Otherwise we use the DOE over - the -phone service. The PS 19 school community are informed by the 
administration and office personnel search out in-house staff for oral translations on an as-needed basis. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

School uses The phone/text system, School Messenger, which sends the message in the requested language via voice 
mail or text based on families preference for emergency situation. For individual calls, such as the nurse's office, one 
of the ESL teachers will be called to interpret in Spanish or Albanian. When it is not one of these languages the DOE 
over-the-phone interpretation service is used.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

During the September Faculty Conference, all staff attending a PD were they receive, review and set up an individual 
plan aligning to the Chancellor's Regulation A-663. The LAC is available throughout the year to assist along with the 
ESL teacher and the Assistant Principal in any area of need presented by the staff. All staff are provided with the DOE 
over the phone Interpretation number along with the direction on how to access. The assistant principal will 
frequently work with staff who are new to the use of the service. In addition, the number is posted in the main office 
where staff utilize to connect families. A file cabinet is looked in the main office with all documents and the nine 
translated versions that are available from the DOE's language and translation page. The documents are ranging from 
all registration forms to emergency cards.

Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

Our school will consult the data provided on the parent survey to ascertain if we can improve the Translation and 
Interpretation that we provide for our parents. Additionally, the ENL teachers and the LAC will survey parents at ELL 
about the quality and availability of Translation and Interpretation that they have received from the school. Feedback 
from these surveys will be discussed with the administration and any changes necessary will be made.
