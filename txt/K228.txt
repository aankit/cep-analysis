Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

IS 228 is a family of empowered, lifelong learners who actively contribute to our school community and engage in the 
learning process academically, socially and emotionally. Through a well developed rigorous curriculum we pride on 
cultivating a learning community by inspiring students of today for greatness of tomorrow and by promoting critical 
thinking, resourcefulness and creativity. We aim to foster responsible citizenship, compassion and leadership in both 
attitudes and actions, and guide every student on a path of quality learning to be ready for either an institution of 
higher learning and / or a career.  

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

Instructional focus: Strategic plan for 2018-2019 academic year is to implement research based and data driven 
strategies aligned to the NY State Performance Standards. The curriculum and teaching initiatives will ensure 
alignment and intended rigor by fostering critical thinking, resourcefulness and creativity.  

Based on the analysis of school-wide Formative Assessments and Advance Data, the instructional team developed a 
challenging, authentic and State guided curricula, programs and assessments. Our instructional focus draws on the 
best educational practices of higher order questioning, academic discussion and constructive feedback, as well as 
helps students develop into lifelong learners in line with our school's mission.  

Cyclical Professional Development sessions will ensure that the needs of individual teachers are met. The PD plan 
includes three approaches: workshops and collaborative model, instructional rounds and one-on- one coaching. 

The development of the instructional focus is guided by various sources of data including Advance, feedback from 
PPO visits, 2016-17 Quality Review report, interdisciplinary instructional walk-throughs and from IS 228 end-of-year 
teacher surveys responses. To ensure that the teaching practices and classroom strategies are in line with our 
instructional focus, a comprehensive, cyclical PD action plan will guide teachers on this path. We aim to empower 
teachers to build a learning community and allow students to assume greater responsibility for the successes in their 
learning process. While high expectations serve as the foundation of our school’s instructional focus, we realize that 
purposeful interdisciplinary planning of our weekly PD sessions will allow teachers to drive their instructional 
practices and invite students to develop their critical thinking skills. In accordance with this ideal, school leaders will 
work collaboratively with teachers in September 2018 to create a school wide list of non-negotiable practices for 
classroom instruction based on our instructional focus. The non - negotiable practices will be displayed and visible in 
all classrooms and hallways. 

Our belief in the power of teacher teams is evident in the way we initiate the programming schedule for teachers over 
the past several years. Initially, only teachers in the Math and ELA departments were scheduled to meet as a team 
and collaboratively plan. Over time we have included the common planning schedule throughout all departments. 
Now ALL subject area teachers (Math, ELA, SS, science and the arts) meet for common planning on a regular basis. 
Our goal for teacher teams for the upcoming academic year is to be self-sufficient, teacher led and to engage in 
interdisciplinary planning. We will offer continuous professional development that will empower teachers to 
collaborate and take responsibility for student learning through inquiry cycles. 

Access to technology has become a major consideration at I.S. 228 through the years. To date, technology is available 
in every classroom on a daily basis. Laptops are available for regular student/teacher use, as well as smart boards, 
document cameras and I-Pads are all available to help implement rigorous, engaging lessons. To monitor students’ 
learning outcomes, IO Education platform is implemented school-wide. This has allowed all administrators, teachers 
and staff members to access students’ data upon demand. To bolster our parent engagement initiatives, we offer 
"Tech Afternoon Hours" (2:30-3:30) every Tuesday afternoon during family engagement time. Family members have 
access to I.S. 228 parent coordinators and volunteer teachers during the allocated time to participate in the school’s 
thematic (i.e. email workshops, online homework navigational tool) tech tutorial. To monitor progress in our students' 
success, all students are assessed in Math and ELA by the I-ready platform. All staff and students have access to the 
school’s Google platform and educational apps through an IS228.org account.  

As part of the goal to strengthen our commitment to the school wide anti-bullying campaign, we will continue to 
implement "Bridg-it" and PULSE initiatives. Bridg-it is a program that allows students, faculty and parents to instantly 
and confidentially alert school administrators of problematic behavior via any web-enabled device. The platform 
allows issues to come to light sooner, making the situation easier to deal with and resolve by the administrators. 
Furthermore, we will continue with the initiatives developed by the DAB community to create, maintain and 
contribute to a culture of tolerance and an equitable learning environment. These initiatives invite the participation 
by the administrators, teachers, students and parents, and will offer tools and strategies to: combat bullying in an 
urban setting, contribute to maintain a positive school culture and respond to and resolve conflicts with effective

restorative methods. PULSE continues to be a proactive approach to fostering a supportive environment in the I.S. 
228 school community. 

The upcoming year marks the fifth anniversary of our in house small group student - educator program known as: 
“STOMP” (Student Teacher Outreach Mentorship Program). Students identified as “at-risk” in all grades meet with a 
teacher mentor once a week during a lunch period. During this time students are able to talk about life goals, 
community service as well as issues and problems that they may be facing in or out of school. Most importantly, the 
one on one or group meetings offer a safe environment to exchange information, get advice and feedback from a 
trusted teacher and group of peers. The following four major topics are addressed: Self-Reflection, Self-Advocacy, 
Career Readiness and Community Service.. 

I.S. 228 offers opportunities to partake in a variety of activities offered before school (“Zero” period), after school, on 
Saturdays and during school hours to help our students develop academically, socially, emotionally and physically. 
Programs offered: ENL Prep, ELA and Math Remediation, Specialized High School Test Prep in Math and ELA, Sports 
(Soccer, Basketball, Tennis, Gymnastics), Cheer Leading, Dance (Chinese, Classic, Hip Hop) Art, Physical Fitness, 
Council for Unity, and Drama. During “Zero” period students are offered extra time in Math, ELA, Music (strings & 
winds), and Photography and Creative writing via yearbook staff. 

I.S. 228 Dance Magnet partners with the Joyce Theater and City Center, allowing students to experience a broad 
spectrum of performances by leading national and international dance companies reflecting the rich cultural, ethnic 
and stylistic diversity. By incorporating ‘Visual Thinking Strategies’ in ELA and Social Studies via PD sessions given by 
an ELA teacher (Astor Educator alumni at Metropolitan Museum of Art, teachers investigate ways students can 
develop key CC skills through analysis of works of art. In the 2018-19 school year we hope to expand the “outside the 
classroom” experience for students to incorporate other subject and magnet areas. 

 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The Heritage Language Program gives students, with a connection to home language and culture, the opportunity to 
develop their bi-literacy skills through a structured humanities-oriented curriculum as defined by the CCLS. We are 
proud to support our students and their families in this unique way of developing oral fluency and literacy in multiple 
languages. In the current global economy multilingualism is an extremely valuable skill to acquire for any career 
choice. Our core belief is shaping an educational plan to help our students develop into well rounded individuals 
ready for the world beyond school. Our intention is to ensure students’ civic participation in the workforce, 
educational institutions and local community endeavors. This year we offered Chinese, Hebrew, Russian and Spanish 
heritage language programs and our teachers have multiple teaching licenses in the field. 

ENL students comprise 12 -13 percent of the school population. The school provides services in accordance with the 
New Language Progression hourly requirements. The services include push in, pull out and placement in heritage 
language classes. To service this group, I.S. 228 attracts highly qualified teachers with multiple certifications, as well as 
creative programming for students and teachers; in particular, various co-teaching models. Teachers need to be 
allowed to develop professionally through series of strategically appropriate PD sessions. According to benchmarks 
that simulate the NYSESLAT, our students need additional time to practice oral and written communication skills 
within content area classes. 

Our special education students are serviced through ICT and stand alone programs. Academically, students need 
additional interventions during the day and after school. Our goal is to provide academic and social-emotional support 
and teacher training.

We need to pay special attention to long term ELLs with an active IEP. Students will be programmed with highly 
trained teachers with intensified professional development sessions. Support from an Inquiry Team ensures equity for 
all students. 

 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Our yearly focus and strongest progress made over the past year is in our ability to provide a supportive environment 
for our students and staff. School leaders communicated clear goals, fostering a commitment to the academic and 
social-emotional success of each child, to the entire school community. Throughout the year members of the school 
community demonstrated a proactive approach in their dedication to each student by collaborating with one another. 
The PULSE initiative instills empowerment, patience, understanding, collaboration and support throughout the school 
community. Our key areas of focus for the upcoming year is to expand the PULSE initiative in support of specific “at 
risk” student subgroups in ENL and Special Education.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. According to our 2016 quality review, IS 228 had successfully implemented the following instructional initiatives 
across all grades and classrooms: a school-wide common learning intention format and gradual release model. 

 

2. The focus of this year’s goal and action plan is the implementation of strategies for successful development of the 
school’s ENL and SWD students. Although these two student groups continue to show improvement in academic 
indicators, such as The ELA and the NYSESLAT exams, the progress is slower than desired. The leadership team’s 
intention for this academic year is to continue closing the achievement gap for these targeted populations. 

 

 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019 60% of targeted students (ENL/SWD) will meet their individual I ready learning targets in math and ELA. 
Using the Curriculum Associates’ I-Ready exam as an indicator.

can help their children. We will also implement the following: grade-level orientations, one on one ENL parent 
placement conferences , Parent-teacher conference nights, State testing informational meeting/strategies for test 
anxiety, ENL language progression report conferences, and how to access IO education platform which allows parents 
to track their child’s academic progress.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
In regards to the Supportive Environment tenet our strength this year was implementing the Continuous Learning 
inquiry team. The team learned about and implemented strategies to support ENL/SWD students.  

Our students who are both ELL/SWD have a lower rate of attendance according to ATS reports and lower test data as 
reported on the NYS exams as well as I-ready, it is our inference that extra support is needed for them to reach their 
highest potential. Our goal is to expand the initial work of this inquiry team to include more teachers and support 
staff.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
Through targeted small group instruction and mentoring, By June 2019, A targeted group of at risk students will 
improve their attendance by 3%, resulting in each targeted student achieving a five point overall gain in their 
academic average as measured by report card grades.

create a plan with incentives for improvement 

Teachers and mentors of identified students will meet 
during parent engagement time on Tuesdays to discuss 
student data and progress. 

 

We will continue to offer student and families access to 
BridgeIT as an outlet for combating school based anxiety 
and bullying.

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and

After reflecting on the attendance numbers of ENL parents coming for meetings to receive updates on their child's 
language progression, we recognized that there are barriers to more parents participating. No matter what language a 
family speaks, parental support is the key to academic success. ENL families are often at a disadvantage when it 
comes to supporting their child academically because of language and cultural barriers. It can be easy to interpret ENL 
parent "no shows" as a lack of interest. However, very often ENL parents want their children to succeed as much as 
any other but are unable to participate to the same extent that other parents participate due to these barriers or their 
work schedules. Regular open and friendly communication from a teacher can make a big difference in parent 
participation in the academic life of their child.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Strong Family and Community Ties. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
Time-bound.  
By June 2019, each teacher will contact one ENL parent each week to share information on his/her student or to inform 
the parent of a school activity. This will be evidenced by an increase in ENL parent attendance at their student's second 
language progression meeting and 50% of all ENL students showing growth on the speaking modality of the NYSESLAT.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
We have a strong partnership with several colleges and universities in the area including CUNY, St. Francis and 
Brooklyn College. In addition we have a hiring committee made up of teachers and administrators. Potential teachers 
who interview provide sample lesson plans, instructional units, teaching portfolios and perform a demo lesson for the 
committee. Student perspectives are also ascertained after demo lessons. In order to retain our highly qualified 
pedagogues we provide a supportive environment where they are empowered to help make key decisions. The 
principal allocates appropriate financing and time for targeted professional development that addresses the specific 
needs and requests of teachers. The Principal and administrators have an “open door” policy which allows teachers to 
feel comfortable discussing their thoughts and strategies for raising student achievement and creating a positive 
school environment. Lastly, the administration takes into consideration each teacher’s skills set and previous 
experience when making decisions regarding programming. We make it a point to place teachers in classroom 
settings where their skills can be highlighted. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
 

The instructional leadership team (administrators, coaches and lead teachers) collaboratively developed the 
instructional focus after doing a school-wide formative assessment. Additionally, last year’s Advance data was 
analyzed for pedagogical weaknesses. After compiling and analyzing the data we found that the greatest areas of 
need amongst our staff were the following: questioning, feedback and formative assessment.

We comprised a cyclical professional development plan which is differentiated to meet the needs of individual 
teachers. The plan includes three approaches: PD workshops, instructional rounds and one on one coaching. 

Administrators receive regular PD through the DOE talent coach, the borough field support center and the 
Educational Leadership Institute (CSA) and CEI. Teachers will receive PD from Brooklyn South, Showcase schools, 
school administrations, coaches, CEI, Literacy Supports and Education Consortium. Paraprofessionals receive PD from 
the Assistant Principal of Special Services and the UFT.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
 

We analyze specific power standards and create scales for each grade level to ensure detailed analysis of what is 
taught and how it is measured. Teachers also use a learning intention with each lesson to ensure the mini-lesson, 
tasks and assessments are all aligned. Teacher teams will review IEP and language progress reports and review port 
folio samples te ensure assessments are appropriate for each student. Trello will be used by teacher teams to create 
personalized learning plans.

During common planning sessions and during Inquiry team meetings, teachers analyze curriculum, lesson plans, 
student work and assessments and record a snapshot of their work on an ongoing daily agenda that is shared with 
and visible to all team members via a google document. Teams started the year by analyzing initial progress 
monitoring data and baselines to look for trends, strengths and weaknesses across classes and grade levels. After 
analyzing data, teachers used protocols to collaborate on team goals. These goals are created with the intention of 
driving instruction in future lessons and units. Additionally, teachers use common planning to “norm” grading of 
school-wide performance tasks and assessments to ensure a fair and unbiased grading of student work. Lastly, 
teacher teams use common planning to share best practices and content specific PD. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. David A. Boody , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and implementing a parent involvement 
policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement between the school and the families. The 
school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving them in planning and decision-making in 
support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to actively participate on the School Leadership 
Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained volunteers and welcomed members of the school 
community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

David A. Boody will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

creating a parent outreach committee 

 
  providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, 

e.g., literacy, math and use of technology; 

  providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and 

 

decision making in support of the education of their children; 
fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and 
monitor their child’s progress; 

  providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 
 

sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and 
in languages that parents can understand;

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.; 

● conduct parent workshops with topics that may include: parenting skills, understanding educational accountability 
grade-level curriculum and assessment expectations; literacy, accessing community and support services; and 
technology training to build parents’ capacity to help their children at home;  

● provide opportunities for parents to help them understand the accountability system, e.g., ESSA/State 
accountability system, student proficiency levels, Annual School Report Card, Progress Report, Quality Review Report, 
Learning Environment Survey Report; 

● host the required Annual Title I Parent Meeting on or before December 1 st of each school year to advise parents of 
children participating in the Title I program about the school’s Title I funded program(s), their right to be involved in 
the program and the parent involvement requirements under Title I, Part A, Section 1118 and other applicable 
sections under the Elementary and Secondary School Act;

● schedule additional parent meetings, e.g., quarterly meetings, with flexible times, such as meetings in the morning 
or evening, to share information about the school’s educational program and other initiatives of the Chancellor and 
allow parents to provide suggestions; 

● translate all critical school documents and provide interpretation during meetings and events as needed;  

● conduct an Annual Title I Parent Fair/Event where all parents are invited to attend formal presentations and 
workshops that address their student academic skill needs and what parents can do to help;

school day to ensure that after-school is fully aligned wi1h 1he school day curriculum; school and disttict goals; NYC, 
NYS and Common Core Learning standards; NYC Blueprints for the Arts; and college and career readiness priorities. 
Certified school day teachers will provide after-school academic enrichment activities utilizing creative, inquiry based, 
and differentiated learning strategies to reinforce Math and  
ELA concepts learned during the school day in small groups and one-on-one. The PAC will meet  
regularly to review curriculum maps and lesson plans, as well as discuss safety, scheduling. A data sorter will enable 
21st Century to access real-time grades, behavior, and attendance for all students.

expression. Most importantly, students who struggle with English or with disabilities will be afforded opportunities to 
establish themselves as members of the school co=unity and leaders, while becoming more proficient with the English 
language and recognizing their untapped talents and abilities.The program design is guided by the research-based 
Youth Program Quali1:y model, focusing on four key areas of positive youth development: safe environment, 
supportive environment, interaction, and engagement. The partnering agencies in this proposal will offer project-
based activities aligned with Common Core Learning standards to increase stundents' math and literacy acquisition, 
school day attendance and engagement, high school readiness, and SEDL. Activities will be offered during after school 
hours across the three program sites, deemed the peak time for youth engage in crime and high risk behaviors. 9 Staff 
will be encouraged to create culturally responsive classrooms, defined as "defined as "using the cultural knowledge, 
prior experiences, frames of reference, and performance styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning more 
relevant and effective for them 

 

The results of our school's NYCDOE's School Survey and input from the PTA, school principals, and parent 
coordinators provided a clear understanding of needs and informed the program content and scheduling, as well as 
the selection of well-respected partners fami1iar with the community. Once the program is fully implemented, the 
CSCs u.ill be responsible for soliciting parent and student input into program design through phone calls, meetings, 
surveys, and participation in quarterly QSA meetings that u.ill inform any needed program adjustments.. We believe 
the benefits of parents' engagement with schools on children's academic achievement, social competence, and post-
secondary readiness.Keys to Abundant Llfe will offer monthly parent/child culinary workshops that is focus 'on health,

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and 
Performance Specialist.  Any updates or revisions to this plan must be made through the iPlan portal by June 30.

Begin description here:            
IS 228’s Part 154 Program will serve 150 ELL students in compliance with all State mandates. 
To supplement this program, our Title III Language Program targets to increase ELLs’ English 
language proficiency and help them meet and / or exceed state academic achievement standards.  
Rationale: Acquiring the literacy level and reaching the required level of English proficiency in 
middle school is an overwhelming task for many of our newcomer English Language Learners 
(ELL). Parents have requested, and continue to request, to have access to more opportunities for 
their children to learn and practice English beyond the school day.  
Research shows that it can take from five to seven years to build cognitive academic language 
proficiency (CALP) in ELLs, we have designed a supplementary program to address both the 
basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS) ("social language") and the CALP ("academic 
language") needs of our newcomer ELL students. Additionally, students who have been in the 
country for several years but continue to need academic language support will benefit from 
participating in the Title III Language Program.  The programs vary according to targeted 
students, languages of instruction and content-areas addressed.  The goal for all programs is to 
improve listening, speaking, reading and writing skills among our ELLs, and increase their level 
of English proficiency as well as meet and / or exceed academic learning standards at each grade 
level.  
Program description:  
1. Zero Period: This program will support up to 12 Entering, Emerging and Transitioning SWD 
ELLs in grades 6-8 with an IEP. In order to prepare for Zero Period, two groups of students will 
work with the special education teacher twice a week before the start of school.   The goal of 
Zero Period is to increase the participants’ reading and writing skills in English and improve 
their proficiency level on the state ELA exam.  One certified, licensed ENL teacher and One 
certified SWD teacher provides instruction and the AP of Instruction oversees the 
program.  “Zero Period” meets four hours per week; on Monday through Thursday. The program 
is to begin November 1, 2018 and end May 2nd, 2019.  Total of 65 days, one hour per day for 
two teachers.  An appropriate library of skill level books in English needs to be acquired in order 
to engage students at their appropriate reading levels.  “Zoom In” reading skills books will be 
utilized to teach reading strategies for comprehension.  Students will be engaged in a variety of 
literature-based writing activities, vocabulary building lessons, and interactive learning tasks to 
help them work with more challenging texts.  For community engagement, parents of Entering, 
Emerging and Transitioning students will be invited in writing (in the Home language and 
English) to sign their child up for this program. Phone messenger and posts on school website 
and Skedula (Pupil Path). Translation services provided by in-house bilingual staff.  Attendance 
will be taken by the teacher each session and submitted to the attendance coordinator and the 
after school director. Parents will be called and records kept in the main office.  The CASS 
computerized ID system will also be used by all students participating in the program.  
2. After-School International Song and Dance, and Language Arts Program: This program 
supports ELLs in developing language proficiency and multicultural experiences through the 
arts. The target population for the Program is 15 ELL students and 6 former ELL students who 
wish to explore their Heritage language and culture while developing their English language

instruction in authentic heritage dance and opportunities to collaboratively choreograph for 
special school events. Students are provided support in the native language as well.  ELL 
students will be encouraged to teach Heritage dance to non-ELLs to foster greater respect for 
American and Heritage cultures.  The international culture will be determined by the amount of 
participants and cultural background.  Option is to break up the program into sessions thereby 
allowing more than one target population and language to participate.  The schedule of the 
program will be one afternoon per week, two hours per session each day, for duration of 15 
weeks. The program will begin the week of November 1st, 2018 and end May 7th, 2019. The

supplementary program affords students extra time and support to develop 
listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills in the English language. Teachers provide project-
based interactive activities aimed to guide students in developing literacy skills aligned to those 
necessary for academic core classes. Special emphasis will be placed on helping students 
develop an awareness of social studies, particularly in the areas of American history and 
geography.  Students will have an opportunity to practice the skills needed for reading 
comprehension and academic writing in Social Studies as a content.  Libraries of non-fiction and 
fiction books related to American history topics, including biographies of Americans from 
various backgrounds, will be used in class; as well as bilingual glossaries and dictionaries.  The 
program will begin December 3rd, 2018, and end the week of May 20th, 2019.  Classes are

2. Educational consultants specializing in English as a Second Language instruction provide PD 
sessions for ENL teachers. Teachers will receive two days of PD from November through June. 
The sessions are custom tailored to meet the needs of the department. Teachers will focus on 
topics such as scaffolding instruction for newcomer students and how to differentiate instruction 
for multiple levels of ELL students within one class. One ENL staff member will attend 
Brooklyn South Professional Development sessions and turnkey to the other staff members 
within the school. ENL staff members are encouraged to attend PD at universities and state level 
conferences at the school's expense. The PD information is turn keyed to content area teachers 
with an ELL student population in their classes. Each professional development session will be

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Rationale: Our goal is to help parents improve their English proficiency for daily 
communication.  Parents are a viable part of the school community, by increasing 
communicative proficiency parents will play a more important role in their children's 
education  and decision making process.   Our goal is to is to improve areas of communications 
with us regarding their son's or daughter's academic and social/emotional progress. We invite 
students to attend any classes with their parents to make the family experience more comfortable 
and beneficial.  A newly created Inquiry Team will help invite parents to attend the listed 
activities, and encourage participation throughout the year (to prevent the loss of interest and 
participation witnessed last year). 
1. We are offering two hours of ENL and English Skills workshops for parents on Thursday 
evenings from 5:30 p.m – 7:30 p.m. for 20 weeks. The classes will begin the week of November 
1st, 2018 and end the week of May 2nd, 2019. Classes are supervised by the Assistant Principals. 
   English Grammar: The first hour of the class will be devoted to teaching English grammar, 
usage, and language to parents whose first language is other than English (LOTE). Parents will 
collaborate with their own child as they experience "real-life" interactions such as completing a 
job application or visiting a doctor’s office. Classes are taught by a licensed ENL teacher with 
numerous years of experience in teaching both students and parents. Parents will receive 
notebooks and writing materials. Newspapers, magazines, and blogs will also be used. Bilingual 
dictionaries are required for in class use. 
   Parent Skills and Strategies Workshop: The second hour of the ENL weekly workshop will 
allow parents to experience skill acquisition in reading and writing. Parents will gain first hand 
exposure to children’s daily lessons and skill acquisition. The ENL teacher will introduce a skill 
or strategy each week and, through shared reading and writing, allow the parents to participate in 
creating responses to reading or writing within a particular genre. Parents will be encouraged to 
discuss these skills and strategies with their children in their native languages. Libraries of trade 
books in English and various native languages will be purchased for use with this program. For 
community engagement, parents of Entering, Emerging and Transitioning students will be 
invited in writing (in the Home language and English) to sign up for this program. Notices 
posted in main office. Phone messenger and posts on school website and Skedula (Pupil Path). 
Translation services provided by in-house bilingual staff. Attendance will be taken by the teacher 
each session and submitted to the Assistant Principal. 
2. Annual entitlement or status letters will be sent to all parents to inform families the of current 
ENL status and current class placement. The ENL coordinator will be generate letters, have them 
translated and sent home for signature and collected.  The letters are saved in a central, secure 
location. Parents and those students who have tested out of ENL will be invited to a celebration 
in October during Tuesday family outreach time. 
3. Tuesday ENL Parent Engagement: Teachers will reach out to parents of ELL and former ELL 
students on Tuesdays from 2:30-3:30 pm. The outreach will begin in October and end in June. 
Teachers are supervised during this time by the AP of Instruction and the Director of 
Curriculum. Parents will be invited to the school during this time for different tutorials and 
workshops on the NYSESLAT, ELA and Math State tests, and the New Language Arts

Progressions. When needed, teachers will use translation services through the NYC Translation 
and Interpretation Unit. We will use our electronic headphone system to translate to specific 
parents when in-house talent is available. Pamphlets in the appropriated languages will be 
provided. 
4. Fliers and Sign-up Sheets in appropriated languages generated by the Parent Coordinators. 
Signs for parents will be posted around the school and in the Parent Engagement Center in 
appropriate languages. Notices will be posted on the school web-site, and Skedula/IO Education 
(pupil path). Poster paper and color ink are required for these materials. 
5. A monthly newsletter is distributed by the parent coordinators.  The Newsletter is translated 
into appropriate languages and posted on the school website each month. Each program for ENL 
students will be promoted in the newsletter throughout the school year with the goals 
accomplished. 
6 Parent surveys are used throughout both semesters to determine the needs of ENL families in 
regards to selecting topics for parent seminars. Based on the feedback, we will add or delete 
planned parent seminars.  Parent interest seems to focus on state exams, promotional criteria and 
high school acceptances. We will plan, invite and implement the seminars as requested. 
7 In addition to the four parent conferences aligned with the distribution of report cards, one 
additional parent meeting will be scheduled to discuss language progress reports. Progress 
verbiage will be aligned with "We are NY" performance descriptors. Some conferences will be 
held during Tuesday outreach times and others during evenings. Specific invites will be sent to 
families in English and in the native language.

SUBMISSION FORM 

2017-18 AND 2018-19 SCHOOL YEAR 

 

DIRECTIONS: This submission form supports schools with organizing and describing the quantitative and qualitative information 

necessary for a well-conceived school-based Language Allocation Policy (LAP) that describes high quality programs for English 

language learners (ELL). This is a two-year plan on how schools will support ELLs’ linguistic and academic needs. This LAP form is a 

part of the school’s Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP). Note: this is a living document; any schoolwide changes involving the 

services of ELLs, such as the addition or expansion of a transitional bilingual education (TBE) or dual language (DL) program should 

be updated in this form. Agendas, minutes of LAP meetings, and LAP team members’ attendance at meetings should be kept readily 

available on file in the school.  When preparing your school’s submission, provide extended responses in the available spaces.  For 

additional information, refer to the English Language Learner Policy & Reference Guide.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
After initial assessment with the NYSITELL and/or LAB-R exams, ELLs are assessed with several placement tests: 1) Multilingual 
Literacy SIFE (MLS) Screener SIFE identification, 2) National Geographic Insider Series placement test, 3) Achieve3000 or I-
Ready NY placement tests to gain Lexile levels, and 4) Teacher-generated assessment tests for differentiation level. Such 
assessments collect data about our ELL demographic. This data directly informs ENL instruction, which then is communicated 
to non-ENL teachers through interdisciplinary teams. 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          61 

 

The testing coordinator and ESL director review the data for the creation of classes and the placement of students and the 
ability to share information with teacher teams regularly during weekly meetings. 
Our school structure is detailed below: 
To identify the placement of our ELLs, we follow multiple steps to ensure our ELLs are placed in the appropriate setting.  As 
ELLs are admitted to the school, at registration we complete the ELL intake process.  With at least one parent or guardian, the 
family is invited to the Parent Engagement Center.  Here, they complete the K-12 Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
either in English or in a translated version that the parent requests.  The completed HLIS is placed in the student’s cumulative 
folder and a copy is placed in the school’s ELL Folder of Critical Documents.  A member of our ELL Intake Team helps with 
translation if necessary.  If no translator is available in the student’s native language, the translation unit will be called. The ELL 
Coordinator is present for the entire intake process and completes all initial formal assessments.  The ELL Intake Team consists 
of:•   Donna Shulman (ELL Coordinator)•   Our Translation Staff: XiLing Zoda (Family Worker, fluent in Mandarin),  Rudi Chen 
Tam (Parent Coordinator, fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese), Tatiana Chelengovskaya (Family Worker & Certified Interpreter 
and Translator, fluent in Russian), Estela Hernandez (Social Worker, fluent in Spanish)• Jacqueline Agosto Monett (Licensed 
ENL Teacher, fluent in Spanish)•  Sheila Damato (Licensed ENL Teacher)•  Scott Herman (AP, Director of Instruction and ENL 
Departments)•  Betty Tang (Licensed Guidance Counselor, fluent in Cantonese)The ELL Coordinator then conducts an oral 
interview with the student based on the results of the HLIS.  If it is determined that the student is dominant in English, even 
though the home language may be different, a more extensive interview and screening process will be necessary.  The ELL 
Coordinator and/or licensed ENL teacher will review a student’s prior work in reading, writing, and mathematics, both in 
English and the home language.  If the student does not have this type of work, we will use our own assessments such as the 
Inside NG initial assessment and the assessment from the Foundations Program that are both culturally sensitive and age-
appropriate.  If it is determined from these assessments that the student is not an ELL, the identification process ends 
here. The ELL Coordinator or ENL Teacher (both licensed pedagogues) will then administer the NYSITELL within 10 days of the 
student’s enrollment.  NYSITELL scan sheets are printed by the ELL Coordinator using the RLBA function in ATS.  Results of the 
NYSITELL are scanned into ATS the same day as test administration.  Immediately following the scan, the ELL Coordinator 
prints the RLCB Scan Report from ATS which indicates the student’s proficiency level and checks for any errors that may have 
occurred while scanning.  The ELL Coordinator will address any scanning issues with the principal.  When appropriate the 
Spanish LAB-R is administered to Spanish-speaking students.  These results are also scanned into ATS the same day as test 
administration.  Test results for students are kept in a binder labeled “continuous testing” and also filed in a “NYSITELL 
completed tests” file in the ELL Coordinator’s office.  NYSITELL and Spanish LAB-R results are immediately shared with the AP 
and the student’s ENL Teacher and/or Dual Language teacher.         If the student is transferring from another school within the 
DOE, the ELL Coordinator checks the student’s history in ATS and based on LAB-R or NYSITELL results, the student is placed in 
the appropriate ENL class.         After the parent completes the HLIS and after the oral interview with the student, the SIFE Oral 
Interview Questionnaire is administered to the student in the native language if the student tests as an ELL on the NYSITELL.  If 
results of the interview show a gap in formal education, then the MLS test is administered to the student in the native 
language (currently the test is available in Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Haitian Creole, and Spanish).  Based on the results of the 
assessment, the student may be classified as SIF. 
 
SIFE determination will be made within 30 days of an ELL student’s enrollment for students scoring at the entering or emerging 
level on the NYSITELL.  As previously stated, students are administered the SIFE Oral Interview Questionnaire to determine if 
there may be a gap or interruption in formalized education.  This is in addition to an interview with the parent to ask about 
previous schooling in the home country.  A member of the ELL Intake Team fluent in that student’s language can conduct the 
interview.  If no one is available for translation, the Translation Unit can be called.  The SIFE Oral Interview is currently 
available in 12 languages: Albanian, Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, English, French, Haitian Creole, Korean, Polish, Russian, Spanish, 
and Urdu. Based on the interview, the student may be administered the LENS examination.  The MLS exam is administered by 
the ELL Coordinator or student’s ENL Teacher.  Our school currently has a MLS account that was established by the NYC DOE 
Office of English Language Learners.  If no MLS examination is available in that student’s language, the ELL Coordinator will use 
the answers from the oral interview to determine SIFE status.  In addition, because SIFE status can now be changed for up to 
one year in ATS, the student’s ENL Teacher can administer math and reading assessments in the student’s language during the 
first month of school.  These can be made through the use of translation services.  Student work produced in class during the 
first few months of school will also help to determine SIFE status.  Since suspected SIFE students are placed in our newcomer 
program, teachers have a better chance of identifying these students as they teach classroom procedures and routines to 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

newly admitted students. 
 
For newly enrolled students, the pupil accounting secretary, Fran Favaloro, conducts an interview with the parents and 
reviews all paperwork from the student’s previous school.  If the student is admitted from another NYC DOE school, the 
student is identified in SESIS and ATS as having an IEP.   For newly admitted students to the DOE (and within the United States) 
whose home language is other than English, the Language Proficiency Team will determine if the student is eligible for ELL 
services based on the IEP.  If a student has an IEP and the home language is other than English, the LPT is formed and they will 
review evidence of the student’s English development.  A qualified interpreter will also be present at the meeting of the 
LPT.   The LPT will review student assessments that include the LENS, oral interviews with the student and parents, and any 
documents from the student’s previous school.The Language Proficiency Team consists of the following staff 
members:•  Donna Shulman (ELL Coordinator), Scott Herman (Assistant Principal), Yael Ben Moshe (Assistant Principal of 
SPEP), Victoria Cama (School Psychologist), Betsy Lopez (ENL Teacher) 
•  Our Translation Staff: XiLing Zoda (Family Worker, fluent in Mandarin),  Rudi Chen Tam (Parent Coordinator, fluent in 
Mandarin and Cantonese), Tatiana Chelengovskaya (Family Worker & Certified Interpreter and Translator, fluent in Russian), 
Estela Hernandez (Social Worker, fluent in Spanish) 
• Jacqueline Agosto Monett (Licensed ENL Teacher, fluent in Spanish) 
• Sheila Damato (Licensed ENL Teacher) 
• Scott Herman (AP, Director of Instruction and ENL Departments) 
• Betty Tang (Licensed Guidance Counselor, fluent in Cantonese) 
- The student’s parent or guardian 
If the LPT recommends the student take the NYSITELL, this will determine ELL status.  The ELL Identification process continues 
as with all students.  If the LPT recommends the student should not take the NYSITELL, the recommendation is sent to the 
principal for review.  Upon review, the principal determines that the student should or should not take the NYSITELL.  If the 
student takes the NYSITELL, it will determine ELL status and identification continues as with all students.  If the principal 
determines the student should not take the NYSITELL, the recommendation is sent to the superintendent for review.  The 
parent or guardian is notified within 3 days of the decision.  Upon review, if the superintendent determines the student should 
take the NYSITELL, the ELL Identification process continues as with all students.   If the superintendent determines the student 
should not take NYSITELL, the parent is notified that the student is not an ELL.  The ELL Identification process terminates and 
the student does not receive ELL services.  Students with IEPs can complete the ELL Identification process within 20 days of 
enrollment instead of the usual 10 day enrollment period.   
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We evaluate the success of our ELLs based on their demonstrated ability to listen with understanding, speak, read, and write in 
English. We evaluate ELL programs based on the progress our students make throughout the year. At the end of each year, 
teachers and supervisory staff reflect on each program’s effectiveness by how much they helped students make progress. The 
measures used to evaluate programs include: 1) Teacher observations of student progress, 2) Achievement on teacher-
generated formative assessments, 3) NYSESLAT, 4) ELA, Math and Science State Tests, 5 NYC performance tasks in all 4 major 
subjects, 6) ELL Periodic Assessment and 7) teacher-created progress reports. When there is sufficient, consistent growth in 
student performance on all of these tasks from month to month and/or year to year, we can say that our ELL programs are 
successful.  
 
The data revealed that we are our students are making language progress and are moving from one level to the next as 
anticipated. Also, it revealed that we are meeting AMAO (I, II, & III).  We use the data was to create new classes for the next 
academic year and group the students accordingly.  
The AMAO tool has been a valuable asset that guides instructional planning and budgetary allocations. We use this tool in 
three ways: 1) Reflect on the effectiveness of specific ELL programs based on the data analysis, 2) Plan classes and identify 
student instructional needs (especially for at-risk students or those with refugee/asylum status), and 3) Allocate funding in the 
school budget (including grants) for different ENL purposes (academic enrichment and recreational).  Data from the LAB-R over 
the past five years indicated that those ELL students who had at least one year of English as a foreign language in their home 
country tended to score at an Advanced level on the initial placement assessments (NYSITELL and LAB-R). In addition, these 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          63 

 

students were successful in making gains each year thereafter, on the NYSESLAT, and tended to test out/become proficient 
earlier than other Newcomer ELLs. Those ELLs who had appropriate or higher level educational experiences and literacy in 
their home language, also tended to make larger gains on the NYSESLAT from year to year than those with more limited 
educational experience. This finding was true across all grade levels. Another pattern across grade levels is the difference 
between the performance of the Gen. Ed ELLs and ELL-SWDs on the NYSESLAT. On all grade levels, Beginner ELLs in Gen. Ed 
achieved gains faster on the Reading and Writing components of the NYSESLAT than they did in Listening and Speaking.  ELLs in 
Special Ed. classes made gains in Listening and Speaking faster than they did in Reading and Writing.  On the Advanced level, 
students in all grades had the most difficulty with the Listening section of the NYSESLAT as compared to their success in other 
parts of the exam.  With ELL-SWDs, the Advanced students made little progress from year to year on the Reading and Writing 
sections of the NYSESLAT. This infers that their lack of progress in those areas may be attributed to their particular disabilities 
rather than difficulty in understanding English. In the Heritage Language program, ELLs tended to improve more rapidly in 
Reading and Writing than they did in Listening and Speaking, with the slowest progress in the Listening sections.  
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

School administrators, coaches and select teachers meet each Friday as an instructional team to review summative and 
formative data. Then they lead teacher teams each Monday or Tuesday in a Cycle of Reflection to review the effectiveness or 
programs, classes or teaching strategies. Furthermore, a team of teachers and coaches will visit classes with ENL students each 
Tuesday as part of an instructional-round. Feedback is discussed and shared with the teachers that same day via email. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
We use ELL data, especially, with commanding students, so we give them additional reading periods four or five times a week 
during or writing two times per week. 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
 
Students are homogeneously grouped in freestanding ENL and Dual Language classes 
 by their proficiency levels: High Intermediate & Advanced ELLs whose home languages are Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, and 
Hebrew.  
An examination of 2017 NYSESLAT data showed patterns across proficiencies grades 6-8. It was noted that our students 
needed the most help in writing, but al components are practiced in ENL and Dual language classes. 
  
Example of student placement: 
 
Grade 6 
There were 1 entering and 8 emerging ELLs placed in Class 601, 9 transitioning  ELLs placed in Class 610 and 11 expanding 
ELLs placed in Class 610.  Finally, there were 14 commanding ELL students in Class 611. 
Grade 7 
There were 10 entering and 8 emerging ELLs placed in Class 701. There were 13 transitioning and 11 expanding in Class 710. 
Finally, there were 7 commanding ELLs placed in Class 708..   
 Grade 8 
There were 3 entering and 7 emerging ELL's in Class 801. There were 8 transitioning ELL's and 13 expanding ELL's in Class 810. 
3 commanding ELL students in Class 808. 
 
We strategiclly placed students who are ELL and SWD in specific ICT or self contained classes to ensure correct number of 
hours of service (push in or pull out). 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          64 

 

 

At Is 228, we have  inquiry teams which meet regularly to review relevant data from summative and formative assessments. 
After looking at student work and assessments, the inquiry teams members turn-key the findings to teacher teams (and 
parents). This allows teachers to differentiate instruction and give new data to the inquiry team. Teachers can also find data 
from a variety of technology platforms such as IO Educations, Google-docs, I-Ready New York, Achieve 3000, Insider Program, 
and School Net. After full Cycles of Reflection, each quarter, adjustment are made to placement, classes, teaching strategies 
and curriculum. 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

Students are homogeneously grouped in freestanding ENL classes by their proficiency levels.The students receive 
instruction from ENL-certified teachers 8 times per week as well as Magnet classes 5 times per week. We also 
discovered through data analysis that students who are at risks of becoming long term ELLs need an extra period or 
two of ENL support. 
 
ELLs in the Freestanding ENL program attend all content-area classes with their regular class cohort.  Content-area 
and ELA instruction is delivered in English, but students have access to native language support through the use of 
bilingual dictionaries and both fiction and non-fiction native language texts. Beginner and Low-Intermediate ELLs are 
taught by ESL/TESOL certified teachers in ELA. High-Intermediate and Advanced ELLs go to a non-ENL ELA class but are 
programmed for an ENL magnet/support class five times per week.  ENL and ELA teachers plan collaboratively to align 
instruction, providing the following scaffolds for ELLs: 1) Modeling, 2) MEAL writing model, 3) differentiation, and 4) 
collaborative learning.  The National Geographic ENL curriculum is used in the Beginner/Low-Intermediate classes. 
High-Intermediate and Advanced classes follow the ELA Expeditionary Learning curriculum. Non-ENL teachers of ELLs 
receive regular training throughout the year coordinated by the Assistant Principal that oversees the department. 
Such training involves in-house instruction from the ENL department as well as outside consultants. Grade-level and 
department meetings are held on a weekly basis to discuss specific students, strategies, and curricula. The purpose of 
these meetings is to continually refine pedagogical practices as well as address the various social/emotional issues 
that arise.     
 

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

We do not have a TBE program.    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

In our Dual Language/Heritage Language classes, students are homogeneously grouped by their proficiency levels: 
High Intermediate & Advanced ELLs whose home languages are Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, and Hebrew.   
 
The Dual Language and ENL departments also coordinate a day of celebration at the end of the year called the 
Heritage Celebration Festival for all Heritage Language students and ELLs. This day is meant to mark the incredible 
achievement our students have accomplished by successfully completing the school year. Teachers create cultural 
stations in which students learn about different cultures. Students and parents bring in their favorite dishes to share. 
Teachers and non-Heritage Language and ENL classes are invited to attend as well.  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          65 

 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

Students at each proficiency level are delivered the appropriate number of instructional minutes in ENL, ELA, and HLA.  When 
students are scheduled, our school programmer and ELL Coordinator work carefully together to ensure that all ENL students 
are programmed and are receiving the mandated number of minutes.  The RLAT report is printed immediately after NYSESLAT 
scores are released, and the report is run every 2-3 days in the beginning of the year to ensure all students are accounted 
for.  If an error is found, the grade level APs and notified and the student’s program is immediately changed.  Students at the 
entering level (formerly beginning) receive 2 units per week, or 360 minutes of ENL.  This will be satisfied by 1 unit of study in 
ENL and 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA (integrated ENL).  There is no flexibility for entering level students. Students at the 
emerging level (formerly low intermediate) will be programmed for 2 units of study per week, or 360 minutes.  They will 
receive .5 units of study in ENL, or 90 minutes, and 1 unit of study in ENL/ELA, or 180 minutes.  There is flexibility of .5 units of 
study, which can be stand-alone ENL or integrated ENL/Content Area instruction.  Students at the entering and emerging levels 
will be grouped together in our 601, 701, and 801 classes.  Students at the entering level who are new to the country and SIFE 
students will be in our Newcomer program, and they will receive both stand alone and integrated ENL.Students at the 
transitioning level (formerly intermediate) receive 1 unit of study per week, or 180 minutes.  These students receive .5 units of 
study in ENL/ELA, or 90 minutes, which is integrated ENL.  The other .5 unit (90 minutes) can be either stand-alone ENL or 
integrated ENL/Content area.  These students will be in the 610, 710, and 810 classes at our school.Our students at the 
expanding level (formerly advanced) receive 1 unit of study per week, or 180 minutes.  They receive the unit of study in either 
ENL/ELA or another Content Area.  These students will be in our 614, 714, 814 (Hebrew) ,615, 715, 815 (Chinese), 616, 716, 
816 (Russian) and 617, 717, 817 (Spanish) dual language programs.  According to new CR Part 154 mandates, Commanding 
students (formerly proficient) will now receive .5 units of study per week (90 minutes) of integrated ENL in ELA or the content 
area.   These students will receive ENL either during push-in ELA or a designated ENL elective.Students in our Dual Language 
program receive the mandated minutes in HLA at the different proficiency levels.  Students at the entering, emerging, 
transitioning, and expanding levels receive 1 HLA class a week, which would be 5 periods of home language arts.         
 
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
   The goals of our freestanding ENL program are to: 
  
1)     Provide support in content-area instruction through interdisciplinary curricula. Teachers integrate math, inquiry, reading, 
and writing skills necessary for success in Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies in order to enrich student learning in the 
aforementioned content areas. 
2)     Teach successful reading, writing, and speaking skills so that students make significant progress toward English 
proficiency, and, in doing so, meet or exceed the Common Core Curriculum Standards. 
3)     Celebrate the diversity of languages and culture in our student body, thereby creating an inclusive environment for all 
students. 
  
ELLs in the Freestanding ENL program attend all content-area classes with their regular class cohort.  Content-area and ELA 
instruction is delivered in English, but students have access to native language support through the use of bilingual dictionaries 
and both fiction and non-fiction native language texts. Beginner and Low-Intermediate ELLs are taught by ESL/TESOL certified 
teachers in ELA. High-Intermediate and Advanced ELLs go to a non-ENL ELA class but are programmed for an ENL 
magnet/support class five times per week.  
  
ENL and ELA teachers plan collaboratively to align instruction, providing the following scaffolds for ELLs: 1) Modeling, 2) MEAL 
writing model, 3) differentiation, and 4) collaborative learning.  
  
The National Geographic ENL curriculum is used in the Beginner/Low-Intermediate classes. High-Intermediate and Advanced 
classes follow the ELA Expeditionary Learning curriculum. Non-ENL teachers of ELLs receive regular training throughout the 
year coordinated by the Assistant Principal that oversees the department. Such training involves in-house instruction from the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          66 

 

ENL department as well as outside consultants. Grade-level and department meetings are held on a weekly basis to discuss 
specific students, strategies, and curricula. The purpose of these meetings is to continually refine pedagogical practices as well 
as address the various social/emotional issues that arise.  
  
The Dual Language and ENL departments also coordinate a day of celebration at the end of the year called the Heritage 
Celebration Festival for all Dual Language students and ELLs. This day is meant to mark the incredible achievement our 
students have accomplished by successfully completing the school year. Teachers create cultural stations in which students 
learn about different cultures. Students and parents bring in their favorite dishes to share. Teachers and non-Dual Language 
and ENL classes are invited to attend as well.  
  
Additionally, the Title III afterschool and Saturday ENL programs provide supplementary support, creating opportunities for 
increased practice in English as well as core content help. Through the Urban Arts Partnership, ELLs work with teaching artists 
that contextualize culture in America.    Students are also permitted to join their parents for family ELA lessons two night per 
week for two hours per night. 
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

PELL students in our Chinese Dual Language program take the Chinese Reading Test in grades 6, 7, and 8.  This makes it easier 
to assess students’ reading achievement in Chinese.  The HLA Teacher and ENL teacher will also review the student’s test 
scores from the previous year in order to determine appropriate instruction and placement.  ELL students in our Spanish Dual 
Language program take the Examen de Lectura en Espanol (ELE) in grades 6, 7, and 8.  It assesses students’ literacy in 
Spanish.  Spanish HLA teachers and the students’ ENL teachers will review these scores to understand students’ proficiency 
level in the native language.    
Newly arrived ELL students whose home language is Spanish take the Spanish LAB-R within 10 days of enrollment.  These 
scores are shared with all teachers, in particular the student’s ENL teacher.   Newly arrived students suspected of having a gap 
in formal education also complete the LENS assessment in Chinese, Spanish, or Arabic. 
Since we have so many different language groups represented, it is a challenge to evaluate all ELL students in their home 
language.  This year, because of new part CR 154 requirements, we will assess students in their home language throughout the 
year.  This will be completed with two measures: the BVAT (Bilingual Verbal Abilities Test) and the Oral Proficiency Interview 
(OPI).  The BVAT assesses the cognitive-language academic ability of students.  Both assessments will be given in the fall and 
spring of each year to all ELL students.  The BVAT is available in 17 languages so the majority of our students can be 
assessed:  Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, Korean, and Polish, among others.  The BVAT takes approximately 30 minutes to complete 
so it will not interfere with instructional time.  The OPI takes place over the phone and consists of a 30-45 minute interview.    
We are also working closely with the translation unit to provide home language assessments in our low frequency languages 
such as Urdu, Uzbek and Tajik.  We are gradually having larger numbers of Uzbek students enroll in our school, and these 
students speak Russian, Uzbek, or Tajik.  ENL teachers will be working collaboratively to create periodic assessments (to be 
administered in the fall and spring) that will be translated into these languages.   
ENL Teachers should also be instructed on how to use the Foreign Language Assessment Directory (FLAD), which is a free, 
searchable directory of nearly 200 tests in over 90 languages.  Because we cannot anticipate ordering every possible language 
for our incoming students, the ENL teachers will need to order these assessments for some students on an incoming basis.  The 
FLAD will help teachers accomplish this goal.  Using the FLAD, teachers can search for tests by name of test, grade, proficiency 
level, language, skills targeted by the test, and intended use.  In the beginning of the year, after we print the RLAT and RELC 
reports, ENL teachers will use the FLAD to decide which home language assessments are best to order for their students. The 
tests will be administered in the fall and again the spring.  If newly admitted students have additional languages, these can be 
ordered using the FLAD.  ENL teachers will also create assessments that will be translated into the home language with the 
help of our bilingual staff and the translation unit.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 

Long Term 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          67 

 

e. 

Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Instruction is differentiated for all ELL subgroups at I.S. 228.  For SIFE students, our ELL teachers use the SIFE Bridges 
curriculum, which has been recently updated to align to the NYS Common Core.  The updated curriculum includes 4 modules 
that are thematic and use both central and supplemental texts.  The Bridges curriculum is also used for SIFEs in Science, Social 
Studies, and Math within our Newcomer ENL program. 
Newcomer students (0-3 years) use the National Geographic Fundamentals curriculum.  This curriculum provides support for 
ENL students (typically at the entering and emerging levels), focusing on standards-based literacy and language 
instruction.  Instruction is further differentiated by using the NYC DOE ELL Units.  These 3 thematic units support the 
Fundamentals curriculum with a variety of speaking, reading, listening, and writing activities.   
Developing students (4-6) years use one of two curriculums, depending on program placement.  ENL students at the 
transitioning level use the National Geographic Inside program.  This program is aligned to the CCSS Standards and includes 
instruction and assessment in the four modalities.  Developing students in the integrated ENL/ELA program use Expeditionary 
learning, which is modified by the ELL teacher to include language supports and objectives.  These students have differentiated 
instruction from the newly created AIR Secondary Curricular Units for the NYC DOE and the Stanford University ELA Units: 
Understanding Language.   
Long Term ELLs (7 or more years) are instructed with the Expeditionary ELA units with differentiated instruction provided by 
the student’s ELL teacher.  Students are supported by the Stanford University ELA units that were specifically designed for 
ELLs.  ELL Teachers provide differentiation instruction through the Focused Reading materials from Teacher Created 
Materials.  This curriculum provides English language support and is aligned to the CCSS.  These students will also use the 
National Geographic Global Issues curriculum during magnet ENL program.  Global Issues is differentiated by thematic units 
that support language objectives.   
Former ELLs up to two years will have differentiated instruction by using the Expeditionary Learning modules that are modified 
by our ELL teachers.  These students will also use the Academic Vocabulary toolkit from National Geographic.  This program, 
aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, teaches words for cross curricular needs, so students are better supported in 
all content areas.   
All ELL students use the Achieve3000 Reading Intervention program and the i-Ready reading and math programs.  These 
technology-based computer programs are differentiated for individual students.  It is particularly beneficial because each 
student can work independently at his or her level while the teacher performs small group work with select students.   
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
For our ELL-SWD students, we provide a variety of instructional strategies and grade-level materials for all content areas.  This 
year, we will be using the Academic Vocabulary Toolkit (from National Geographic) not just for Former ELLs but for ELL-SWD 
students.  This provides students with access to academic vocabulary that they need to master in order to be successful in the 
content areas and on all state assessments, including the NYSESLAT.   
ELL-SWD students receive a variety of differentiated instructional strategies such as step by step directions, small group work, 
charts with visuals of key concepts, math manipulatives, and audiobooks, to name a few.  ELL Teachers continue to work with 
content area teachers by providing support in how best to instruct ELL students, particularly those with disabilities.   
We plan to continue our M.E.A.L. workshop writing series that was provided by ELL teachers this year to all staff 
members.  This training helped teachers of ELL-SWD students to implement a flexible writing model that provides students the 
structure to write a main idea and support it with evidence and analysis.  To accelerate English language development, ELL-
SWD students benefit from the Foundations curriculum and the Global Issues curriculum, both from National Geographic, as 
well as the Focused Reading materials.  ELL-SWD students use the Achieve3000 Differentiated reading intervention program 
and the i-Ready reading and math programs that are tailored to each student’s reading and math levels. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
In addition to the methodologies outlined in Question 8, our school offers ICT classes with ESL/TESOL certified teachers as well 
as SETSS instructional periods to ELL-SWDs with a focus on mathematics and reading. ENL and Special Education teachers 
carefully select appropriate instructional materials and then differentiate in order to provide the necessary scaffolds for ELL-
SWDs, per their IEPs. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          68 

 

  
In order for ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and gain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment, we use 
curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility.  Out ELL-SWD students all use the Achieve3000 and i-Ready differentiated 
reading and math programs.  These allow students to work independently and at their own pace in order to achieve their goals 
and objectives and improve English proficiency.  ELL-SWD students also follow the Inside NG Program that has built-in 
differentiation to each unit and lesson.  The differentiation is based on student’s varying language proficiency levels.  It is also 
important for our teachers to understand the difference between learning disabilities and language acquisition.  Our ELL-SWDs 
do not usually receive self-contained ENL, but are rather in a group of other ELL students during either magnet program or 
integrated ENL/ELA.  This allows not just for flexible scheduling for also instruction because all ENL teachers receive training on 
differentiated instruction and the differences between that and modifications.  .   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
ELA-targeted interventions include multiple entry points and scaffolds that teachers create to differentiate the National 
Geographic or Expeditionary Learning curriculum. ELLs also receive five periods of ENL magnet per week, in which an ENL 
teacher works with students on reading, writing, and speaking skills while unpacking key content concepts. We purchase 
supplementary enrichment tools such as Achieve3000, Brainpop, Brainpop ESL, Raz Kids, Science A-Z, and the necessary 
technology (laptops, iPads, and Smartboards) to use them. At least one day of our Title III after-school program will 
incorporate an ENL intervention class for ELLs that require additional help with their course load. 
  
The primary intervention in math is teacher training. Highly trained and qualified teachers will be enlisted to teach ELLs. They 
will employ the necessary engagement strategies that will provide multiple entry points for students. The class will be paced 
appropriately, according to students’ mastery of the subject. Teachers will evaluate students’ needs on a case by case basis. 
ELLs are invited to enroll in magnet and other after-school programs that offer meaningful interactions with EP students. Such 
classes and programs include: Chinese Dance Troupe, New York Junior Tennis League (NYJTL), orchestra, jazz band, art, Student 
Government, Student Teacher Outreach Mentoring Program (STOMP), girls and boys basketball team, physical education, Hip 
Hop Dance, and cheerleading.    
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In 2018-19, we will expand the Dual Language/Heritage Language program to include the target language of Hebrew in 
sixth,  seventh grades and eighth grades. Additionally, students will receive Target Language enrichment twice per week to 
deepen their proficiency. In the beginning of the year, all ENL and Dual Language students and their families will be invited to 
an orientation meeting that outlines the high expectations and benchmarks students are expected to meet throughout the 
year. During that meeting, we will also review the various intervention and enrichment programs that we offer. Parents will 
meet the supervisory staff that directly oversee their child/children and given the means to directly communicate with said 
staff members via email and telephone.  
  
Teachers in the DL program will have increased interdisciplinary team time to meet with other DL teachers. They will also have 
increased department time, in order to align instruction with Gen. Ed. and ENL teachers.  Within the freestanding ENL 
program, teachers will form interdisciplinary connections in ELA as well as during magnet classes, thereby preparing students 
for English proficiency in the next year and beyond. During their interdisciplinary team time, ENL teachers will contribute 
strategies and models that will fortify Gen. Ed. instruction.  
  
We will purchase Raz Kids, Science A-Z, Achieve 3000 and Brainpop ESL to incorporate in classroom instruction. All ENL and DL 
classrooms will be equipped with new Smartboards, iPads and/or laptops.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

There are no programs or services that will be discontinued for ELLs. . 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          69 

 

All students have equal access to before- and after-school programs: various dance troupes (Chinese, Hip Hop, Cheerleading), 
academic support programs (Saturday Academy, ENL, ELA, and Math tutoring), chess, and sports programs. Even though ENL 
students must attend ENL magnet, they participate in all other special events such as Science Fair, the Egg Drop contest, 
honors classes, and are encouraged to audition for school plays and musicals. Outside of the magnet period, resident artists 
teach classes monthly to ENL students and coordinate performances to commemorate cultural holidays such as Chinese New 
Year.     
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
As mentioned before, all ENL and DL classrooms are equipped with Smartboards, iPads and/or laptops. Online programs that 
are purchased specifically for their use are ST Math, Brainpop ESL, Science A-Z, Raz Kids, iReady, and Achieve3000. Bilingual 
word-to-word dictionaries are purchased in every target language represented in our school. All students receive a NYSESLAT 
prep book that they can keep to accompany test prep during class leading up to the test. Students receive all of the same 
materials and supplies as non-ELL and –DL teachers in their content areas. For instance, in Science, they receive microscopes, 
specimens for dissection, goggles, gloves, and etc.      
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Native language support in the DL/HL programs is delivered through Social Studies, which employ full language immersion in 
the target language of Hebrew, Russian, Mandarin, and Spanish. Both ENL and DL classrooms have native language libraries 
that include both works of fiction and non-fiction.  
  
Within the ENL classroom, students have access to bilingual dictionaries and content area glossaries. Additionally, ENL teachers 
all have knowledge of and/or speak Spanish, Arabic, or Mandarin fluently, which is useful in translanguaging.    
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

First and foremost, per current research, ELLs and DL students are grouped according to their proficiency level. With the 
exception of SIFE students, who are grouped from 6-8 within the same class, all ELLs are grouped within Beginner/Low-
Intermediate and High-Intermediate/Advanced classes. Teachers collaboratively decided on curriculum that targets the needs 
of each group. The Beginner/Low-Intermediate group use National Geographic while the High-Intermediate/Advanced group 
uses Expeditionary Learning like the rest of the school. Keeping students in homogeneous groups also aids teachers in their 
best practices and adapt curricula that can be reused and refined.   All ENL and DL classrooms are equipped with Smartboards, 
iPads and/or laptops. Online programs that are purchased specifically for their use are ST Math, Brainpop ESL, Science A-Z, Raz 
Kids, iReady, and Achieve3000. Bilingual word-to-word dictionaries are purchased in every target language represented in our 
school. All students receive a NYSESLAT prep book that they can keep to accompany test prep during class leading up to the 
test. Students receive all of the same materials and supplies as non-ELL and –DL teachers in their content areas. For instance, 
in Science, they receive microscopes, specimens for dissection, goggles, gloves, and etc.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not co-locate. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Our ELL Coordinator along with the Assistant Principal of the ENL department manages all the ENL activities throughout the 
year. The ELL Coordinator will greet parents and students and administer the NYSITELL or Spanish LAB-R during enrollment. 
Teachers will explain procedures to new students and pair them with a class partner to show them around. Finally, the 
Assistant Principal of ENL,  will supervise cafeteria time and make himself available for questions from both the student(s) and 
their family. For our newly enrolled ELLs, there are welcome activities coordinated by the Newcomer program 
teachers.  Students are also welcome to come to the Parent Engagement Center with their parents during registration.  Here, 
they can speak with the Parent Coordinator, ELL Coordinator, and any other members of the ELL intake team to ask and have 
any questions answered about the beginning of the school year.   During the year, new ELLs will receive support through our 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

 

Newcomer program.  They will receive specialized instruction and curriculum in ENL instruction, social studies, math, and 
science.  Our ELL and content area teachers are highly qualified in instructing these students, and have received (and will 
continue to receive) extensive professional development on scaffolding lessons for new ELLs.  ELLs and their parents will also 
be invited to the ELL Parent Engagement Day, where ELL teachers, the school counselor, and the parent coordinator will be 
available to assist parents and students, as well as answer questions during individual parent meetings.  Translation will be a 
priority for us this year, so we will make it a priority to have the materials translated into as many possible languages as we can 
for this day.  Our new ELLs will also be part of all of our school fundraising events for our spring ELL trip-such as bake sales and 
holiday sales.  We want to expose these students to at least 2 field trips throughout New York City, and to this end our new 
ELLs will help support and make advertisements for the fundraising efforts of the ENL Department.  We hope to take these 
ELLs to at least one cultural event and one museum. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

Language electives offered to ELLs from all levels of proficiency in English and in their Hebrew, Spanish, Russian, Mandarin, and 
Italian. 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

a) We employ the side-by-side, two-way, immersion DL model in Social Studies. Because of the two-way 
model, Transitioning, Expanding and Commmanding  ELLs are integrated with EPs for 100% of the day.    
  
b) Social Studies is the core content classes in which instruction is taught in the target language (Spanish, 
Mandarin, Hebrew, and Russian).  
  
c) Teachers alternate English and target language instruction every other day. For instance, on Monday 
students will learn about World War II in English and then write a MEAL analysis of the war the next day 
in the target language. 
  
d) Emergent literacy is taught in the Target Language Enrichment class, which is twice per week. Each 
language (English and target) are taught in an alternating cycle – see point C.    
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
a) Foci of professional development for ELL personnel include SIFE, New Language Progressions, integration of ENL and 
content. ELL personnel receive professional develop in three ways: 
b) Collaborative team building through weekly departmental meetings. ENL teachers meet to discuss administrative and 
instructional issues and make decisions on them. They also meet to plan curriculum, devise interdisciplinary connections, and 
support one another in professional learning. 
c) By developing professional learning workshops to instruct and inform non-ENL teachers of ELLs the best and most current 
practices. Teachers collaborated to create a series of workshops to integrate the MEAL writing method in the ENL, Special Ed., 
and General Ed. curriculum.

d) Through PD provided by outside organizations that specialize in ELL instruction such as Global Learning Project and 21st 
Century.       
Non-ENL teachers of ELLs are provided training throughout the year in two ways: through in-house workshops facilitated by 
our ENL teachers and by attending PD led by outside organizations. ELL instructional specialists also come into our school to 
observe such teachers and give immediate, actionable feedback.  
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
At least 15% of all teachers’ total PD time will be dedicated to ENL training. This will be provided by the ENL department and 
will focus on scaffolding the MEAL writing method and providing models for content integration. At least 50% of all ENL 
teachers’ total PD time will be in ENL training. This will be provided by outside PD facilitators from 21st Century, Global 
Language Project and Ed. Consortium. Additional PD will be provided by Scott Herman, AP of the ENL department and the DOE 
office of DELLS.  Attendance and an agenda are collected from each weekly departmental meeting. Records from each ENL PD 
include, but are not limited to, the following: session materials, attendance, and agenda. Scott Herman, AP of the ENL 
department, will keep these records. Outside PD materials are kept by the attendee(s). Follow up for attending outside PD 
include teacher-led discussions, presentations, and application in the classroom.  
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
To provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs, the ENL department will organize an annual ELL Parent 
Engagement Day, with meetings in the afternoon and evening.  Members of the ELL Intake Team will be available to direct 
parents and answer any questions during this time.  All ENL teachers will be present, in addition to the content area teachers 
of our ELL Students and our AP of the ENL Department.  In addition, members of our Translation & Interpretation Staff will be 
available, including bilingual staff members and teachers who can assist during this time.  Parents will receive written 
notification of the meeting in their home language and our translators will follow-up with phone calls to parents to make sure 
they attend the meeting. At the ELL Parent Engagement Day, the ENL Department will organize a PowerPoint presentation to 
acquaint parents with the requirements of the program.  This will include goals of the program, language development 
progress, language tests the students have to take including the NYSITELL, MLS, and NYSESLAT, and language development 
needs in the content areas.  Content area teachers of ENL students will be present during this time as well.  Then there will be 
a Q & A session between teachers and parents. After this, teachers will have individual meetings with parents similar to how 
the conferences are organized during Parent Teacher Conference days.  Parents will have designated times they can speak to 
their child’s teachers, and the parents will receive the student’s program so they can discuss any areas of concern with all 
teachers.  Each ENL student will also receive a progress report prior to the Parent Engagement Day so parents are aware of 
their child’s language progress and results.  At the individual meetings, translators will be present.  If translators are not 
available in the parents’ language, then the translation unit will be called.  Parents will also be encouraged to bring an English-
speaking translator to the meeting, when possible.  All parent handouts and information packets will be available in multiple 
languages for the day of the conferences.   Parents will complete a survey at the end of the session to determine if their needs 
were met or if they have further questions.  Attendance will be recorded by all teachers to make sure they have seen as many 
parents as possible.  Any parents who did not attend the Engagement Day will be called by the child’s teacher.  The child’s 
teacher will arrange to meet with these parents either after school or during the Tuesday parent engagement time period.  

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 
We make the best efforts at IS 228 to involve the parents of our ELL students.  This includes fostering strong relationships with 
our bilingual teachers and translators to ensure that almost every language spoken at IS 228 is represented.  We believe that 
parental involvement begins with communication, and when we have staff who can communicate with our parents this is the 
key to our success.  ELL parents attend our open house night in September, our parent conferences, and our new ELL Parent

Engagement Day.  The dual language program sponsors a multicultural fair in which all ELL parents are invited to attend and 
volunteer.  Students share their cultures through music, food, art, and readings and the entire school community is invited to 
participate during the day.The PTA makes an effort to reach out to all parents, including parents of ELLs, by sending out weekly 
emails, called, "Boody Blasts" that are sent to parent emails.  ELL parents have also asked to be more involved in their child's 
homework procedures.  To this end, we have improved our homework website on the IS228.org homepage, where teachers of 
all subjects post nightly homework assignments.  Because it is accessed through a shared Google document, parents can view 
the website and translate everything into their native language.  In this way our ELL parents are aware of their child's 
assignments and are more prepared for parent conferences and teacher meetings.During Tuesday parent outreach, ELL 
parents are invited to the school to meet with their child's teachers.  We also offer a NYSESLAT Parent Information Session in 
the spring.  Translated materials are available and translators are present to communicate with parents.  At this meeting, the 
ELL Coordinator and ENL teachers prepare a presentation to review the NYSESLAT and what is required of students to take the 
test, as well as how parents can help their children.  It is followed by a Q&A session in which parents have the opportunity to 
ask questions about the test and share other concerns.  In addition,  we offered a Spring ENLParent/Student Library 
Workshop as an opportunity to meet with the local librarians and obtain library cards and information about the programs 
given afterschool, on weekends and activities taking place during the summer. 
Our ENL parents come from a variety of diverse backgrounds and cultures.  To this end, many of them, especially parents of 
newcomer and SIFE students, are not accustomed to life in the United States and general school culture.  All parental 
involvement involves the use of translated materials and our staff of bilingual teachers and certified 
interpreters/translators.  Our ENL parents truly want to be involved at school, and need the added support to overcome the 
language barrier if they do not speak English.  Parents want to support their child's academic progress, so their needs are 
addressed when we continue to support them in understanding the variety of assessments the students take throughout the 
year.  The NYSESLAT Parent Information session acquaints parents with this yearly test.  When parents complete the 
orientation process, they are informed of the requirements of the NYSITELL and/or MLS examination and how they can help 
their child succeed in school.Parents sometimes have difficulty coming to the school during the day, so with the addition of the 
Tuesday parent outreach time parents have extra opportunities to meet with their children's teachers after school.  The 
Multicultural Fair brings together parents of different backgrounds and nationalities, and helps promote the goals and 
objectives of our ENL/ Heritage Language programs.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Dominick D'angelo , testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

The parent coordinators created a matrix of all the student home languages in our school. This data was 
correlated to each students' assigned home room so that translated materials can be disseminated accordingly. 
Our school also developed a home survey, to be anonymously completed by all students. The purpose of this 
survey was to assess the effectiveness of communication between I.S. 228 and parents. The Language Proficiency 
Team (LPT) was established to convene about any issues regarding the ELL identification process. In doing so, the 
LPT also assess translation and interpretation support. Finally, over the past two years, we have hired staff who 
are fluent in Spanish, Russian, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese), Arabic, and Hebrew; all predominant languages 
within our school. These staff members frequently translate documents that go out to parents as well as interpret 
for any parents who come into the building.

C. Parent-teacher conferences. School staff serve as translators. 
Additionally, we will hire Arabic and Urdu translators. 

D. Open house events. These events are for prospective students. We 
enlist the help of bilingual volunteers on such events. 

E. School messenger phone calls. This useful program translates 
school messages automatically in each family's designated language.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In case of an emergency we use Remind App that translates messages into home language, as an alternate we use the 
DOE phone translator. 

 
 

 
 
Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

On the first day of school a professional development session is conducted in which all Chancellor's regulations that 
are "important" are reviewed including A-663. Teachers sign for their copy of A-663 and other important regulations 
to ensure that all have read, received and understand them. 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

We have completed the checklist of notification requirements. Brochures, notices, and fliers are translated and 
publicly posted. We have one parent coordinator in the main office that have been trained on the many resources we 
have for translation. Should the parents of more than 10% of our students speak a primary language that is neither 
English nor a language that we have translators readily available for, we will use the Translation and Interpretation 
Unit.  

 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79 

 

A. At the beginning of each year, we issue a parent survey that was created by staff developers at our school. We use 
the data from the surveys to develop an action plan on how to maintain high quality programs while improving in 
areas where needed. For instance, this year, parents expressed a need for STEM after-school programs. In response, 
we have formed a partnership with St. Francis College, to provide accelerated science enrichment for our 7 th and 8 th 
grade students; we are developing a coding course with a Robotics teacher; we are continually offering per session 
opportunities for licensed and well-qualified teachers to lead after-school programs. 

B. School leadership responds to all parent phone calls and emails in a timely manner; this feedback is usually 
immediately put into place. 

C. We have a designated technology coordinator that maintains a school website. Our AP of Operations maintains the 
school Facebook site. Both online sites are ways in which parents can submit feedback.
