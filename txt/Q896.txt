Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our young women are expected to model grades 6-12 college-readiness skills in all subject areas and be given 
opportunities for which the learning is centered in innovative student-led opportunities that strategically result in 
closing the achievement gap in mathematics and science. 

 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

We also believe that early exposure to AP and College Now courses will close the financial gap that students of color 
face when they enroll in college. We believe that if students graduate from TYWLS College Ready, with AP qualifying 
scores and with College Now credits, they will be better situated for college success and completion of undergraduate 
coursework in four years or less.  

  

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
The Young Women’s Leadership School of Queens is known for its sisterhood and its motive is to help prepare young 
women for the real world. We are one of five single gender schools in NYC and twenty schools nationwide are 
modeled after our flagship school in East Harlem. The Young Leader's Network, now the Student Leadership Network 
is passionate about educating the "whole girl" so that she becomes the best woman that she can be. 

 

Specific to our school, the SLT has been working cooperatively to encourage the four pillars within the school 
community. In order to effectively affiliate and incorporate the four pillars and the morals and beliefs of the school, 
our Student Government proposed the TYWLS Honor code which expressed the expectations of a TYWLS student. The 
Young Women’s Leadership School of Queens continues to empower young women of all ethnicities. 

The special needs population at TYWLS consists of almost 20% of TYWLS scholars. Their academic needs vary, but 
TYWLS of Queens fully supports the Least Restrictive Environment initiative. We offer programming options such as 
ICT, SETSS, speech therapy, physical therapy, and two students who receive one-on-one Paraprofessional support.

our Students With Disabilities with all mandated services and of course, upon request. One unique special population 
is our conservative Muslim families who are not always supportive of their daughter's aspirational dreams to attend 
college away from home. 

The special needs population at TYWLS consists of 82 TYWLS scholars. Their academic needs vary, but TYWLS of 
Queens fully supports the Least Restrictive Environment initiative. We offer programming options such as ICT, SETSS, 
speech therapy, physical therapy, and two students who receive one-on-one Paraprofessional support. Additionally, 
our ENL (English as a New Language), population is supported through a push-in and pull-out model to address the 
learning needs of each individual student. With the increase of our IEP population, we will be implementing even 
more pull-out sessions for customized support.

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

1. The school has made the most progress in the area of Supportive Environment as evidenced by our PPO Areas of 
Celebration for 2018. We are also proud of the progress made in Effective School Leadership. 

2. We have increased our College Readiness index from 45%-70% for the class of 2018. 

3. Our June 2018 Regents scores with regard to Mastery have increased significantly in U.S. History (61%), Living 
Environment (52%) Global History( 42%). 

Our key area of focus this year is Rigorous Instruction for 2019. We want to increase SAT scores by providing more 
coherent assessments.  

To this end, we have challenged teachers to make a commitment to student learning that either requires a higher 
level of RELEASE or INNOVATION. We want students to be stimulated to take charge of their learning and a teacher-
centered environment does not support this mission.  

Common practices that teachers use in our classrooms include but are not limited to: 

Socratic Seminars 
Student-led research opportunities 

 
 
  Classroom debates 
  Cornell note-taking 
  Google classroom  
  Partner quizzes 


Impact on Middle School learners: 

1.  70% of all 6th 8th grade students earned a level 3 0r four on both the ELA and the Math State test in 2018. 

 

 

 

Impact on High School learners: 

1.  Students are receptive to and asking for more AP classes and College Now Opportunities. 
2.  54% of the girls who took AP Seminar received qualifying scores in May of 2018. This was our first year of the 

course. 

3.  100% of 10th, 11th and 12th grades students are taking one or more AP classes for 2018-2019. 
4.  25 girls enrolled in College Now at our school voluntarily for our first on- site course. 
5.  Currently, only 5 of the 75(.06%) of the class of 2019 have not achieved a College Ready score on the 

Common Core ELA Regents 

1.  How do teachers plan and refine curricula to meet the needs of the diversity of learners in your school? What 

system(s) do you have to assess adjustments to curricula and its alignment to Common Core Learning 
Standards and instructional shifts? 

2.  What assessments do you and your staff administer across grades and subjects? 
3.  How do you and your staff use data from these assessments to inform instruction? 

 

 

Reflection: Traditionally, teachers have meet in Department and in Grade Teams to identify trends among the lowest 
third and then create interventions on a individualized basis, to address student needs. Data used to inform these 
collaborative teacher team meetings included: 

  Mock Regents Data 
  Marking Period grades 
  Tutoring Logs 
  End of Unit assessments 
  Class participation and performance 

 

This year, in addition to the traditional methods mentioned above, teachers in grades 6-12 began by administering a 
baseline assessment aligned to AP skills in all subject area , including Art. The assessments were compiled using 
modules and units available to teachers on the NMSI Laying the Foundation website. Teachers used this platform to 
retrieve entire tests or to customize their own assessments to identify student who are entering their grade below 
skill level.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
We are currently up to 70% from 45% of students who are considered college ready. Going to 90% would mean that 
we have increased by 45% within 3 years. As a college bound school, we need for all students to graduate college 
ready. We want to avoid having students to take remedial classes in college.

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By May 2019, 90% of the class of 2019 will graduate College Ready and achieve college-ready scores of 75% on the 
ELA and a 70% on Common Core Math, respectively.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
Beginning October 9, 2018, frequent and on-going communication that is tailored to each student, every Tuesday 
during Parent Outreach time. Teachers and Parent Coordinator will schedule and facilitate the meetings. 

Talk to parents to tutor them on basic math skills - To support parents with “at-home” math homework help, TYWLS 
will provide basic math skills workshops to refresh parents on math skills. 

Parents must understand why College Readiness scores are so important. They save time and money in college. With 
education, parents can encourage their daughters to retake exams and support the school's efforts to get students to 
attend tutoring.

Strengths 

  Examples of leadership strengths include all teacher observations receive face-to-face feedback after a 

 
 

teacher observation to reflect on teacher practices.  
Leadership gives clear next steps for teachers to help improve practice immediately. 
Leadership delineates clear groups of students (such as ELL's, SWD's, and Graduation At-Risk students) for 
whom teachers are assigned to closely monitor progress through tutoring and inquiry work.  

Needs 

  Discussions with teachers during IPC's reflect that instructional staff will benefit from more timely feedback to 

inform their practice. 

  Teachers require more professional development to raise scores in Domains 1 and Domain 3 according to 

 

observation ratings and student report card data.  
Increase opportunities for students to lead work, for teachers to innovate and release. In doing so, there will 
be more ownership on learning.

Monthly Professional Development meeting with the LTF Vertical 
Team will center around designing instruction that will help all 
students access rigorous material, and questioning and 
discussion techniques that support students in critical thinking 
skills. Teachers would like to seek out instructional coaches to 
help improve curriculum development and delivery.  

Select teachers will participate in Inter-visitations with teachers 
rated Highly Effective in a Danielson component for which they 
have been rated Developing/Ineffective.  

On alternating Mondays, teachers will meet in grade level and 
department level meetings in order to improve LTF coherence 
between departments and grades.  

Based on supervisory feedback, teachers and administration will 
identify resources that will improve teacher practice. They will 
devise a plan together in order to obtain this resource, consider a 
timeline for next steps, and set goals for how resources will 
improve their practice. Resources include technology, furniture, 
student resources, portfolios, manipulatives, posters etc.  

Teachers participate in continuous parent and family contact 
every Tuesday afternoon. Teachers call parents in groups or 
individually to keep parents aware of student progress in the 
classroom. Parent meetings are also set up during this time in 
order for families to meet with all teachers at once in order to 
discuss concerns or celebrations.  

Parent engagement/education will occur in the form of family 
meetings and goal-setting for students who are "At-Risk" for not 
graduating on time. Additionally, workshops for families of 
students with IEP's will be held each fall, as well as other 
workshops held throughout the year by various teachers (such as 
Skedula tutorials, graduation requirements, college counseling, 
Edmodo, 8th grade and 12th grade events, AP information 
sessions, etc.)

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Recruitment: Our school community receives between 20 and 40 resumes for every teacher posting. Potential staff 
members go through a multi-step process which includes interviews, writing samples and demo lessons. The current 
staff supports the process by observing the demo lessons and sitting in on group interviews. 

Retention: As a school community, teachers are monitoring teacher talk with timers that were purchased by the 
principal as they conduct inter-visitations and self- regulate. Within the majority of observation reports, the principal 
and assistant principal cite teacher talk time. During year one, the focus is to raise teacher awareness regarding the 
number of minutes they are talking to students (lecturing) versus the number of minutes students are engaged in a 
rigorous task. For year two and three, the PD plan will focus on the cohesiveness of the overall lesson, with clear links 
between the mini-lesson, independent/group work, lesson summary, and the learning objective. As teachers engage 
in workshop model practices, there is a school-wide focus on improving the number of open-ended and critical 
thinking questions, which allows for an increase in opportunities for student-centered thinking. The supporting 
document is the DOK wheel which is prominently posted in each teacher’s classroom and widely referenced in 
informal and formal observation reports. (1.2) 

With a team of 36 educators, their observation reports clearly indicate improvement in the competencies of student 
engagement and communicating with students. For example, in year one, teachers are clearly communicating the 
goal of the mini-lesson as well as independent/group work expectations. Unlike previous years, the teaching team has 
incorporated more opportunities for Think/Pair/Share, Accountable Talk, and debates. Students often share in 
student government meetings and with their advisory teachers that teachers are allowing them to work with partners

7. The vast majority of staff is engaged in data inquiry and analysis of our bottom third as we look at deficiencies 
within literacy in grades 6, 8, and 11. (4.2)  

8. As teachers engage in workshop model practices, there is a school-wide focus on improving the number of open-
ended and critical thinking questions, which allows for an increase in opportunities for student-centered thinking. The 
supporting document is the DOK wheel which is prominently posted in each teacher’s classroom and widely 
referenced in informal and formal observation reports. (1.2)  

The majority of teachers have signed- up for professional development workshops to further quality of instruction 
and girls education best practices. Teachers have participated in day workshops as well as overnight conferences. The 
turnkey process occurs in formal and informal ways and, specifically during department and faculty meetings. 

Teachers receive in-house support from their Peer Collaborative Teacher in the form of intervisitations and coaching 
sessions. Teachers and school leaders attend off site PD and achieve CLTE Certification hours.

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The school has adopted a school-wide grading policy to ensure consistency and coherence across all grades. The new 
policy has an increased weight for multiple types of assessments. The school utilizes mock regents exams at the high 
school level to measure student progress throughout the year. Teachers use the DDC program to create and monitor 
progress on classroom assessments.  

 

Baseline data will be reviewed by the LTF Team first and then by all teachers. Three samples of student work; 
completed baselines that demonstrate high, middle and low performance on the assessment will be reviewed along 
with samples of the rubric used for grading. Student work from all subject areas will be analyzed for trends that 
demonstrate student needs and/or deficiencies. Then, as a grade and as a department, teachers will review upcoming 
unit plans and modify instruction to address the gaps identified by the baseline assessment data review. 

 

 

Desired impact on student learning: 

1.  All students who did not demonstrate mastery on the skills in the baseline assessment, as evidenced by a 

failing grade, are assigned to six weeks of mandated remedial tutoring every Tuesday. 

2.  Students will be administered the same baseline assessment to determine if progress towards mastery has 

been made. If yes, they move out of remedial tutoring. If no, they remain and continue to work towards 
mastery for another six weeks. 

3.  Through the modification of existing classroom instruction and curricula, students will receive more targeted 

instruction and more focused assessments due to the data analysis of baseline assessments. 

 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          44 

 

achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The Young Women’s Leadership School of Queens in compliance with the 
Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary School (ESSA) Act, is responsible for creating and 
implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving 
them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to 
actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained 
volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

TYWLS will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● Continually survey parents and child for effective possible changes; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments;

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand via letters, phone blasts and email in most prevalent language; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community;

The school’s Parent Involvement  

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families. 
The Parent Coordinator or a dedicated staff person will provide parent workshops based on the assessed needs of the 
parents of children who attend the school and will work to ensure that the school environment is welcoming and 
inviting to all parents. The Parent Coordinator will also maintain a log of events and activities planned for parents 
each month and file a report with the central office.;

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Literacy skills are assessed using the the NYS ELA exam, the NYS Regents exams, and the NYSESLAT.  An initial 
classroom  benchmark  assessment  is  also  provided  by  the  classroom pedagogue  to 
determine  students’  initial  lexile  levels.  In the first ten days of school, ENL teachers conduct informal speaking, reading, and 
writing assessments with ENL students in order to determine areas in need of development.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

ENL teachers and content-area teachers communicate via email.  Communication with content teachers and co-teachers is 
subject to time availability (common preparation periods).   Co-planning structure used varies depending on needs of students 
and is flexible in order to meet the needs of students.  Co-teaching methods used include parallel teaching, alternate teaching, 
station teaching, one teach-one observe, team teaching, one teach-one support.  These co-teaching structures are aligned 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

 

with the Affinity Group’s Integrated ENL PD’s and “Collaboration and Co-Teaching: Strategies for English Learners” by Andrea 
Honigsfeld and Maria G. Dove. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Summative Assessments happen in the form of essays, projects, presentations, and exams in core content classes.  Content 
teachers communicate with ENL teachers areas of progress and areas of need for ENL students.  ENL teachers focus on 
literacy/writing/content skills providing supports as needed.  Students will also be creating portfolios to track progress and 
performance.  Success evaluation comes in the form of NYS ELA exam scores. Currently the school is #1 in the district.   
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Content teachers communicate with ENL teachers weekly.  ENL teachers provide support in the form of scaffolds (literacy, 
writing, speaking, vocabulary), targeted language needs, often developing supplemental materials to support students in 
literacy/writing development.  ENL teachers address interventions through one-on-one support, classroom support, and after 
school tutoring.  ENL teachers work with the core content teachers to develop language in all content areas.  Instructional 
supports are used in core content classes to facilitate academically rigorous and challenging instructional goals.  ENL teachers 
engage students in instructional conversations, giving students the opportunity to think-aloud, demonstrate content 
knowledge and language development, as well as, utilize these instructional conversations as additional assessments of 
language development, content knowledge, reading and writing skills. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
Out  of  the  2.3%  of  students  that  currently  embody  our  ENL population,  3 are  long  term  ELLs, 1 is a transitioning 
newcomer, 9 are Commanding, and the remainder are approaching  commanding.  7 of these students are ELL-SWDs. 
  
NYSESLAT scores are used to determine a baseline for ENL minutes.  ENL programming ensures that ENL students receive ENL 
support from an ENL educator. Students in grades 6-8 receive more than the recommended minutes in order to strengthen 
and develop core content and language skills to ensure high school readiness.  Currently all ENL students in HS receive more 
than the recommended minutes in order to support and strengthen content and language skills necessary for the Regents 
exams.  Commanding students receive 90 minutes or above to help support the transitioning process. 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

ENL teacher shares ENL student breakdown with staff at PD along with scaffolding suggestions to support students in core 
content classes.  ENL teacher meets with ELA, SS, and Science teachers to discuss student progress, as well as, supports 
students’ need to continue to develop language, literacy, and writing skills.  Information is also shared during breakout 
sessions on Monday PD’s, through emails, and Skedula logs.  ENL teacher participates on Principal’s Instructional Cabinet 
Meetings as needed.

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

An integrated co-teaching model is used, as well as, targeted pull-out lessons, depending on the proficiency level and 
language needs of ENL students.   The ENL programming minutes are provided in compliance with CR PART 154 and 
the NYSESLAT data.  At  the middle  school  level,  classes  travel  in  blocks  and  are  placed  by  grade level in 
heterogeneous (mixed proficiency levels) groups based on the previous  school year’s NYS ELA exam. At the high 
school level, students are given a more individualized programming in heterogeneous classroom groupings.   
  
ENL programming is based on the educational philosophy that language should be taught in conjunction with 
academic content.  ENL teacher focuses on the language needed to support students in accomplishing content 
tasks.  Support is based on the needs of individual students.  Some students may need support learning Tier 1 words, 
while other students may need support with fluency.  All ENL students receive support with Tier 2 and Tier 3 
vocabulary.  Students practice and exhibit knowledge of language through speaking, writing, listening, and reading 
activities.   
  
Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning students receive targeted pull-out support in English language development 
(reading/writing/speaking/listening) as well as, support with content assignments and projects.   
We have an ELL tutoring club after school on Mondays where HS students tutor MS students in a supportive 
environment facilitated by the ENL instructor.  This helps build community between HS and MS students.  MS 
students have the opportunity to form relationships with older peers who have had the experience of learning a new 
language and can give advice and study tips while HS students gain self-confidence in their own language skills and 
abilities.  HS students receive community service credit for this support.  MS students self-select what assignments 
and skills they need support with.     

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

N/A    

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

N/A  

 

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

In compliance with CR PART 154, students are programmed according to NYSESLAT proficiency levels for ENL, ELA, and 
HLA.  To ensure compliance, ENL quarterly reports from Affinity Group are analyzed and changes are made to student/teacher 
schedules subject to program availability.  Instructional minutes are provided in both an ICT and pullout model.  Entering, 
Emerging and Transitioning  students  receive  instruction  employing  both  models  while Expanding and 
Commanding  students  receive  instruction  only  in an Integrated Co-teaching  model.   Middle school students receive ENL 
support in ELA and Science classes.   
High school students receive ENL support in ELA, Math, Science, and History classes.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
All instruction is provided in English with language support focused on vocabulary development and targeted content 
skill.  Instructional approaches are based on the concept that Language is best learned through the development of content 
skills, a philosophy of QTEL training by Dr. Waliqui.   Students are given scaffolded support for vocabulary development and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

reading/writing skills, such as sentence starters and models of language structure.  Visuals are used to aid in the understanding 
of core content.  Discussion strategies are used regularly in core content classes, helping students develop speaking skills and 
content skills.  Students also have access to dual language dictionaries and other students who speak their home 
language.  ENL teacher attends ELL Leadership PD series and Co-Teaching PD’s at the Affinity Group and implements ENL and 
Co-Teaching strategies in ICT classrooms.     
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

The majority of ELLs entering our school have received Freestanding ENL instruction, which means that English has become the 
language of academia for them.  They have not had much exposure to academic vocabulary in their home language.  Students 
are encouraged to use their home language, bilingual dictionaries, and discuss core content with peers who speak their home 
language.  Newcomer ELLs utilize vocabulary boxes, creating their own bilingual dictionaries, using bilingual dictionaries and 
images to support their home language.   
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

All ELLs are encouraged to take advantage of after-school tutoring.  All ELLs are given extended time on exams.  Students 
receive differentiated support as needed through reading and writing scaffolds, modified texts, graphic organizers, vocabulary 
boxes, use of visuals to aid in conceptual understanding.  ENL teachers provide targeted interventions for students as 
discussed in questions 8 & 9. 
  
a. SIFE students receive support with study and organizational skills in advisory class in order to help students acclimate to the 
culture of learning expected at school. 
  
b. Newcomer ELLs receive targeted one-on-support as needed for vocabulary and language development. 
  
c. Developing ELLs receive scaffolding with literacy, writing, and vocabulary skills. 
  
d. Long Term ELLs receive support with literacy and writing skills. 
  
e. Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status receive support with reading and writing assignments 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
Teachers use a variety of strategies to provide access to academic content areas and accelerate English language development 
including interactive Promethean boards, Elmo projectors, Small group, pair work, annotation, cornell note taking, word walls, 
glossaries, videos, visuals, reading and writing scaffolds, modified texts as needed, vocabulary boxes, ed-modo, Google 
Classroom, audio textbooks, color coding, verbal repetition, guided notes, various groupings, and co-teaching 
models.  Students are grouped homogeneously and heterogeneously depending on lesson/language objective.  Teachers 
utilize co-teaching models that will support ELL-SWDs according to the needs of students and the lesson/language objectives. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
 ELL-SWDs have more opportunities for individualized instruction.  ENL teachers use one-on-one instruction to address the 
individual needs of students.  As stated in question 8, students receive targeted support in specific areas of need.  ENL teacher 
utilizes grouping, guided notes, verbal repetition, visuals, color-coding, etc to support ELL-SWDs.  Communication about the 
needs and progress of ELL-SWDs occurs weekly between ENL teachers and SPED teachers.  Differentiation and scaffolding are 
also used to support ELL-SWDs.  ENL, SPED, and Content teachers practice co-teaching strategies that vary depending on the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

needs of students and the skills being targeted.  Co-teachers may use a variety of techniques including parallel teaching with 
two groups, both teachers interactively teaching, one teacher teaching and the other supporting, or one teacher teaching 
while the other observes.   
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
All ELLs receive push-in co-teaching support in collaboration with content teachers.  Literacy and writing skills are supported 
through the use of visuals, vocabulary boxes, graphic organizers, modified texts, and scaffolds.  All services are provided in 
English but students are encouraged to speak with peers who speak their home language if needed.  In middle school, students 
receive ENL support in ELA and Science classes.  In high school, students receive support in ELA, Science, Math, and Social 
Studies classes.  All ENL students are encouraged to attend after-school tutoring on Tuesdays to receive extra help with 
assignments. 
  
Students receive targeted ENL support as needed.  Students may receive support in developing Tier 1, 2 and 3 vocabulary, 
reading fluency, and writing.  Entering, Emerging, and Transitioning often receive ENL support in a pull-out classroom.  ENL 
Teachers focus on developing reading/writing/speaking/listening skills, as well as, core content skills through the use of 
modified texts, texts at a lexile level above their reading level, vocabulary games, cloze-end activities, writing activities, 
etc.  ENL teachers also support students in developing academic, organizational, and time-management skills to help acclimate 
students to the culture of learning at our school. 
Targeted interventions vary depending on the needs of the students determined by the ENL instructor through classroom 
observations, assessments, and feedback from core content area teachers.  In the year 2016-2017, two transitioning students 
received targeted support in fluency and sight word development, as well as, core content skills.  In the year 2017-2018 two 
students that were expanding and transitioning received targeted support in developing reading and writing skills for content 
area courses.  This year, 2018-2019, one transitioning student is receiving targeted support in developing fluency and sight 
word development, as well as, core content skills. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

Due to the success of targeted ENL pull-out support, we will be continuing with targeted ENL support for Entering and 
Emerging students. Transitioning and Expanding students will receive targeted support as needed and determined by ENL 
teacher.   We have implemented an ELL tutoring club where MS students receive help with homework from HS students.  This 
after school club is driven by student needs and goals and will provide a safe space for students to receive extra help on 
assignments.  During this time focus may also be on developing organizational and time-management skills with students 
during this period.  ENL teachers will also be able to assess which areas students need more support with, as well as, progress 
throughout the year. 
  
We will also be implementing a modified grading policy and purchasing modified texts.  During Monday extended day time, we 
will be providing time for co-teachers to meet and plan curriculum and activities, focusing on inquiry-based work around the 
needs of our ELLs.   
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

N/A 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
There are no restrictions.  ELLs are encouraged to participate in all after school activities and supplemental services offered. 
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In core content areas, teachers use Promethean boards, Google Classroom, visual aids, bilingual dictionaries, modified texts, 
scaffolded writing activities, vocabulary boxes, and graphic organizers.  For building writing and analytical skills, ENL teacher 
utilizes strategies from the Hochman Method in core content classes. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58

and content development, Dix-It game cards for vocabulary development, Superteacherworksheets.com for language 
development.  ENL teachers also utilize a variety of games such as pictionary, memory, charades, etc to support language 
development in an engaging and interactive environment.  Various novels at the appropriate reading level are also utilized to 
support reading/writing/speaking/listening development. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

ENL services support home language through the use of bilingual dictionaries, vocabulary boxes, peer language support, 
visuals, instructional conversations, and over-the-phone translation services provided by the DOE.  Students are encouraged to 
utilize their home language in creative projects and with other students who speak their language in the classroom.  Students 
are also encouraged to make connections between their experiences of the world and what they are learning in class.       
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

In compliance with CR PART 154, students are programmed according to NYSESLAT proficiency levels for ENL.  To ensure 
compliance, ENL quarterly reports from Affinity Group are analyzed and changes are made to student/teacher schedules 
subject to program availability.  Instructional minutes are provided in both an ICT and pullout model.  Entering, Emerging and 
Transitioning  students  receive  instruction  employing  both  models  while Expanding and 
Commanding  students  receive  instruction  only  in an Integrated Co-teaching  model.   Middle school students receive ENL 
support in ELA and Science classes.  High school students receive ENL support in ELA, Math, Science, and History classes.    
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
The Young Women’s  Leadership School of Queens offers 2 summer  intensives led by an ELA instructor and on-site 
administrator to support newly enrolled students. The Summer Bridge program is one week while the TYWLS explorers 
program is a three-week program. 
  
We have also formed a lasting partnership with Queens Community House that provides full 8 week summer intensive 
activities prior to the  beginning of the school year.   
  
Several ELLs in grades 6-7 will be attending an ELL Enrichment Summer Program sponsored by the DOE. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

French, Blended Language, and Spanish 
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)?

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
 
ELL personnel attends workshops sponsored by the DOE throughout the school year.  ENL teachers are given ENL sponsored 
PD’s for Common Core as well as online support. 
  
ENL teacher has attended the Affinity Group’s ELL Leadership Series and Integrated Co-Teaching PDs.  Through the ELL 
Leadership Series, ENL teacher has incorporated QTEL teaching strategies in curriculum as well as, co-teaching strategies in 
ELA, Social Studies, and Science classes.  ENL teacher has incorporated writing strategies from the Hochman Method and 
Writing Across Content PD. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff members have been provided  with an  ESL/ELL Survival  Guide published by Joss and Bass to support  the instructional 
transition from elementary  to middle school and middle to  high school. Additionally,  content area  teachers  will attend 
Professional Development sessions  to help reinforce  new strategies  they obtain.  Using information gathered from teaching 
surveys, ENL teachers will share strategies with content teachers on how to develop and support students with language 
development in professional learning groups.  ENL teachers also share with staff strategies learned from DOE-sponsored PD’s, 
as well as, strategies acquired from the Affinity Group’s ELL Leadership series and Integrated Co-Teaching PD’s. 
  
Professional  development  records  for  ELL pedagogues  are  kept  in  a  google  doc  that  is  approved  by  an  administrator 
on  a  monthly  basis.  Additionally, a  copy  of  the workshop  agenda  is  disclosed to  the  payroll  secretary  upon  return 
from  a  field  attended  workshop. In  house  professional development sessions  are  held  once  per  week and a paper 
attendance is  taken  before  each  meeting.

orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences? 
  
Once  per  week,  all  ENL homes  are  contacted by phone  or  email to discuss student success and 
struggles.  All  correspondence  is  recorded  in  Skedula.  ENL teacher meets with parents at the beginning of the year to 
discuss goals of the program and language development in content areas.  ENL teacher utilizes the EDAT to share information 
about student language development and areas of focus.  ENL teacher shares student's NYSESLAT level, testing 
accommodations, and ENL instructional break down with parents.  Additionally, the ENL Coordinator  works  with  the SPED 
team to support translation  service  for  ENL students  who  also  need  IEP  accommodations annually.  Teachers are 
encouraged to use over-the-phone translation services provided by the DOE are used to communicate with families. 

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Fostering a strong family involvement is a school-wide goal.  There are no restrictions on families participating in school 
events.  All parents, including ELL families, are encouraged to participate in school-wide events.  Notice of such events is given 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60

and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided

in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.
