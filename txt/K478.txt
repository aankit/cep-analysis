Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

Our mission statement reads as follows: We believe that all students can achieve academic excellence. Teaching them 
to be responsible and productive citizens and preparing them to participate fully in the world they will face after 
graduation is an essential component at EBT. The entire school community is committed to ensure the students' 
cognitive, creative and social growth. In partnership with universities, corporations and community organizations, 
students will have the opportunity to experience the world of work.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          9 

 

 

 

 

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  
Located in East Williamsburg, The High School for Enterprise, Business and Technology (EBT) is one of the three high 
schools located at the Grand Street Campus. Over the past few years, our four-year graduation rate has exceeded 
75%, above the city average, including reaching over 80% for the class of 2016 and 78% for the class of 2017. As of 
June of 2018, EBT is officially an International Baccalaureate World School, and will begin to offer IB courses leading to 
the IB diploma in September, 2018. In addition to their core academics, students have the opportunity to participate 
in three CTE (Career and Technical Education) programs (CISCO Networking Academy, Academy of Hospitality and 
Tourism, and new this year, engineering), join any of the 20 sports teams on campus, or join our award-winning arts 
program, with classes in instrumental music, chorus, and visual art. Our student population is primarily Black and 
Latino (95%) and majority male (66%), with sizeable populations of English Language Learners (8%) and students with 
IEPs (17%). 

  

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

EBT’s focus is to serve our special populations by giving them the skills and knowledge necessary to graduate from 
high school and to succeed in college and career. Our ELLs need additional support in language acquisition and 
support in the four modalities (speaking, listening, reading and writing), as well as helping them acclimate to a new 
culture. Our students with IEPs need additional support in higher level cognitive activities, including written and 
mathematical analysis and extended writing, as well as help in managing behavior and overcoming challenges and 
setbacks in a constructive manner.  

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

We have worked extremely hard to meet the city-wide expectations set forth in the Framework for Great Schools.  

 

Two areas of celebration are as follows: 

 

Rigorous Instruction: We have focused on building the skills that students need for college and the 21st century 
workplace. In addition to the aforementioned IB and CTE programs, our school also offers nine Advanced Placement 
courses. Our school instructional focus is to have students develop the skill of using evidence to support arguments in 
discussion, which will then transfer to stronger writing in literacy and math, and develop the communication and 
collaboration skills that support college and career readiness. Developing these types of critical thinking and analytical 
skill is a challenge; one that the teachers, staff and administration work hard every day to achieve. 

 

Supportive Environment: We recently began a peer mentoring program, in collaboration with the Center for 
Supportive Schools in Princeton, NJ. Peer mentors from our upper grades meet with a group of 9th graders on a 
weekly basis, to discuss and plan for making good choices, becoming successful high school students and avoiding 
pitfalls. We are looking to grow in this area by having our student government take a more active role in getting 
students voices heard in the building decision making process. We have also recently started a Gender/Sexualities 
Alliance across all three schools at the Grand Street Campus, which focus on issues facing the LGBTQ+ community. We 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          10 

 

have also created formal channels for teachers and other staff members to raise concerns with the administration; 
UFT members have an appointed time slot at each cabinet meeting, in addition to the monthly consultation 
committee meeting between UFT members and administration. 

 

One area for improvement follows: 

 

Effective School Leadership: According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, only 44% of teachers say that the 
principal is an effective manager who makes the school run smoothly, and only 54% of teachers say that they trust the 
principal. We began to address this concern last year by hosting a school-wide off-site meeting focused on developing 
a new school mission and shared vision, and by allowing more opportunities for teachers to express their concerns to 
the administration through UFT representatives, both formally and informally.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
1. According to the most recent 2017-18 School Quality Guide, the High School for Enterprise, Business and 
Technology (EBT) scored 3.72 in the “Rigorous Instruction” category, above both the borough and city average. EBT 
scored a rating of “Well Developed” in the quality review measure of “How interesting and challenging is the 
curriculum?” on its most recent quality review (2017-18). All of these ratings speak very well for our school’s 
commitment to rigorous instruction. 

Some highlights from the 2017-18 School Quality Guide and the 2016–17 School Performance Dashboard include the 
following: 

  Percent of 9th grade students earning enough credits to be on track for graduation: 88%, compared to 79% in 

comparison group. 

  Percent of 10th grade students earning enough credits to be on track for graduation: 75%, compared to 73% in 

comparison group. 

  % of students who came in at Level 1, who graduated in four years: 66%, compared to 60% in comparison 

group. 

Other indicators of rigorous instruction include the following: 

  EBT is now an IB (International Baccalaureate) World School, offering IB courses leading to an IB diploma as of 

September, 2018. 

  EBT offers Advanced Placement classes in seven subjects (English Literature, English Language, U.S. History, 

World History, Calculus AB, Environmental Science, Computer Science Principles). 

  EBT offers CTE (Career and Technical Education) instruction in two programs: CISCO Networking Academy and 

Academy of Hospitality and Tourism. Students have the opportunity to take industry tests that are the 
equivalent to Associate’s and Bachelor’s Degrees in the field. 

2. Our priority needs for this are to (all data from 2017-18 School Quality Guide and the 2016–17 School Performance 
Dashboard): 

 

 
 

Increase the percentage of students who graduate with a Regents diploma and meet CUNY’s standards for 
college readiness in English and Math, which currently stands at 33%, below 39% for our comparison group. 
Increase the average score on the Global History Regents examination, which is currently 60%. 
Increase the average score on the Algebra 1 Regents examination, which is currently 62%. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          13 

 

 

 

Improve survey score on question related to % of teachers that say that respond to challenging questions in 
class (school value 47% vs. 59% for city) 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June, 2019, we will improve College Readiness Index in English and Mathematics (currently 33%, as compared to 39% 
in comparison group) by 3%, as measured by Regents examinations.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Academic intervention services like tutoring, after-school 
programs, and Saturday Institute will be offered to students who 
are having difficulty with academic course work, based on 
Regents scores, report card grades and teacher 
recommendation. This includes after school intervention for 
ELLs. Students will be encouraged by teachers to maximize the 
use of Castle Learning and Khan Academy online software for 
hands-on practice with Regents questions. Teachers in math and 
English administer interim assessments to measure student 
progress throughout the year. 

Teachers participation in professional development throughout 
the year, focused on student engagement, questioning and 
discussion and assessment. PDs are offered in-house by lead 
teachers, who turnkey information from Superintendent 
monthly meetings, and by field support center. Goal is for 
teachers to use 5-30-10 model, which encourages student 
engagement and rigor, which will result in higher Regents scores. 

School leaders and teachers will communicate to students the 
importance of achieving “college-ready” pass levels on Regents 
examinations, including avoiding the need for remedial classes in 
college. This will occur in grade-level assemblies, held once per 
semester. Students who are struggling with content in any core 
subjects are given individual support by teachers and 
encouraged to use many different approaches besides classroom 
instruction (online learning, student-to-student tutoring) to 
achieve.

The school holds a curriculum review for parents at freshmen orientation, held in June before new class arrives and 
again in September. We also hold curriculum information sessions at parent conferences and at School Leadership 
Team meetings. Key personnel are APs Supervision, who present or appoint lead teacher to present. 

School Leadership Team (SLT) will communicate to parents, once per semester, the requirements necessary to be 
considered “college-ready” by the city, so they understand why students who may have already passed an English or 
Math Regents exam may be asked to re-take it, in hopes of achieving “college-ready” pass level.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
1. According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, the High School for Enterprise, Business and Technology (EBT) 
scored 80% positive responses on survey questions related to guidance and 76% positive responses on survey 
questions relate to safety. On our latest Quality Review (May, 2018), the school received a rating of “Well Developed” 
for the measure “How clearly are high expectations communicated to students and staff?” Some of our strengths 
include the following: 

  78% of students in grades 9-12 agreed or strongly agreed that adults at their school (including teachers, 
administrators, counselors, and the principal) help them plan for how to meet their future career goals.  

  82% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they feel safe in their classes at their school. 
  88% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the adults at their school tell their students they believe they 

can achieve high academic standards. 

2. Priority needs for this year include creating methods for discerning when students are falling behind or having 
trouble in class, and giving opportunities to meet expectations. Supporting evidence from Quality Guide: 

  54% of students responded that, in most or all of their classes, their teachers help them catch up if they are 

behind. 

  47% of students responded that, in most or all of their classes, their teachers notice if they have trouble 

learning something. 

  38% of students responded that, in most or all of their classes, their teachers support them when they are 

upset. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound. 
By June 2019, improve the percentage by 5% of students who respond positively to the questions in the "Social-
Emotional" category on the next school survey, as compared to 69% on the 2017-18 School Quality Guide.

Strategies to address the needs of 
students with disabilities, English 
language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., 
overage/under-credited, SIFE,

We will implement peer mentoring for the 
freshmen, in collaboration with the Center 
for Supportive Schools in Princeton, NJ. 
Peer mentors from our upper grades meet 
with a group of 9th graders on a weekly 
basis, to discuss and plan for making good 
choices, becoming successful high school 
students and avoiding pitfalls. 

We will encourage all students to show 
greater respect to one another and to 
adults in the building by improving the 
school culture by promoting awareness of 
the “Respect for All” program. We will 
teach “Respect for All” lessons in each of 
the English Language Arts (ELA) and English 
as a Second Language (ESL) classes, hold 
grade-level assemblies during spring term, 
and honor students at our award 
ceremonies who are nominated by teachers 
for demonstrating exemplary integrity and 
character. 

The Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) 
provides a safe space for LGBTQ+ students, 
and gives them a platform to spread 
information about respecting these 
students.  

Teachers attend Professional development 
offered by Superintendency related to 
equity and social-emotional learning and 
support. Teachers debrief at department 
and school-wide meetings to find best ways 
to integrate these practices.

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Supportive Environment in order to 
support  the  whole  child?  Include  the  timeline  and  identify  key  personnel  and  stakeholders  responsible  for 
implementation and oversight. 
A number of our programs have parental outreach components. Our ENL (English as a New Language) program hosts 
two parent pot-lucks per year; supervised by ENL teachers. Our peer mentoring program has a parental outreach 
night; supervised by peer leader teachers. During freshmen orientation and parent-teacher nights, we have 
presentations related to “Respect for All” and GSA and Young Women’s Leadership clubs; supervised by APs Pupil 
Personnel and AP Humanities. At these presentations, we review school's focus on social-emotional health, including 
restorative justice practices, peer mentoring and "single shepherd" guidance counselors. 

We will teach “Respect for All” lessons to parents on the same date as the Parent-Teacher Conferences in the spring 

 

 
Part 4 – Budget and Resource Alignment

scored 3.20 in the Collaborative Teachers category, just slightly below the city average. On our most recent Quality 
Review, we were rated “proficient” on the measures related to this topic. There were some very positive signs in the 
Quality Guide related to teachers being supportive and respectful of our students’ cultural and linguistic backgrounds: 

  87% of students agreed or strongly agreed that they see people of many races, ethnicities, cultures, and 

backgrounds represented in the curriculum 

  89% of students agreed or strongly agreed that their teachers respect their culture/background. 
  89% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the teachers at their school are actively trying to improve their 

teaching. 

  89% of students say that their teachers present positive images of people from a variety of races, ethnicities, 

cultures, and backgrounds. 

Some of our strengths include the following: 

  Teachers with common preps meet on a weekly basis, during which they discuss curriculum, lesson plans and 

look over student work, looking for gaps in achievement upon which to focus. 

  Teachers have access to shared curriculum and other resources on a shared Google drive. Teachers are very 

willing to share their resources, especially with new teachers. 

  At department meetings and weekly Friday PD sessions, teachers have the opportunity to work together, 
share concerns with each other and their department supervisor, and get professional development. PD 
topics range from effectively using data, to classroom management strategies, to ways of engaging students 
in accountable talk and higher level thinking. 

  Over the past three years, we have sent teachers to professional development conferences, such as the 
National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) 
conferences and The Coalition of Schools Educating Boys of Color (COSEBOC) conference. 

  Teachers are encouraged to conduct inter-visitations with fellow teachers to see best practices, and to speak 

to other teachers when having issues with curriculum, or student behavior. 

2. Priority needs for this year: 

Provide high quality professional development that follows a logical progression, with time for teachers to develop 
and build upon prior work. According to the Quality Guide, only 61% of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that 
overall, their professional development experiences this year have included enough time to think carefully about, try, 
and evaluate new ideas.

Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Adjust Friday schedule to allow for hour-long professional 
development and planning time for teachers. PD based on needs 
assessment of Advance ratings, so that all PD is targeted and 
meaningful, and approved by PD Committee made up of UFT and 
Administration members. PD topics remain constant for each 
month, so teachers have time to build on strategies and revisit at 
later sessions. 

Teachers conduct inter-visitations, to reflect on best practices 
within department and provide non-evaluative feedback to 
teachers. 

Campus teacher leaders conduct building-wide walk-through 
observations. Each month focuses on a different subject area, 
same Danielson competency. Best practices are shared out with 
staff via newsletter and at teacher professional development 
sessions.

1. According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, and backed up by findings of our latest Quality Review (May, 2018), 
teachers and parents feel that our school sets high expectations for our students, and that our school leaders are 
supportive of them.  

  96% of families say that the principal encourages feedback from the community and them through regular 

meetings.  

  94% of families say that the principal at their school promotes family and community involvement in the 

school.  

  78% of teachers say that the principal sets high standards for student learning.  

2. Our priority need is to have the principal more clearly set a clear vision for the school, and to be more involved in 
instructional planning with teachers. Evidence from Quality Guide to back up this priority: 

  65% of teachers say that the principal communicates a clear vision for this school.  
  54% of teachers say that the principal knows what’s going on in their classroom.

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

1. According to the 2017-18 School Quality Guide, topics related to strong family-community ties received over 80% 
positive responses. Highlights from the Guide include: 

  90% of families say that school staff regularly communicate with them about how families can help their child 

learn.  

  95% of families say that their school communicates with them in a language and in a way that they can 

understand.  

  90% of families say that they have communicated with their child's teacher about their child's performance.  

2. While these numbers are very positive, they represent only a portion of our parents. Only 23% of our parents 
responded to the survey this year. This reflects some another area where parents do not feel fully engaged, such as: 

  55% of teachers say that families are offered opportunities to visit their child's classroom, such as observing 

instruction or participating in an activity with their child. 

The priority need this year is to increase the level of parental participation and engagement.

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
When staff positions become vacant, Assistant Principals and teachers attend New York City Department of Education 
(NYCDOE) recruitment fairs and post position availability on electronic bulletin board at Teachers College at Columbia 
University. APs invite candidates to the school for a tour and to meet other administrators and other teachers, 
especially teachers who have been recently hired. Staff then discuss candidates and make hiring decision. It is 
important that candidates are not just highly qualified, but a good match for the culture of the school. 

APs conduct frequent informal observations, as mandated by the Advance evaluation system. Evaluators send out 
descriptive emails following soon after the visit, with commendations, areas of growth, and next steps, all utilizing 
Danielson’s Framework for Teaching as a rubric. After this email is sent, the evaluator reviews their comments in a 
short meeting with the teacher. Then, the official observation report is filled out. A similar process takes place for 
formal observations. 

Teachers meet in common-prep meetings on a weekly basis, to discuss curricula, pedagogy and strategies for dealing 
with challenging situations in the classroom. Experienced teachers serve as mentors (both formal and informal) for 
newer teachers in the department. In addition, we make available to all teachers class curricula, lesson plans and 
materials collected and organized by teachers in a central archive. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  
The High School for Enterprise, Business and Technology (EBT) has adjusted its Friday schedule to allow for a weekly 
professional period. This time is split between targeted professional development, and time to allow teachers to work 
in common preparation groups on curriculum and lesson plans. Using results of informal observations, administrators 
can see what categories teachers need assistance with, and target professional development in those areas. PD 
sessions are offered by the Superintendent’s office, Department of Education, professional organizations and vendors 
(such as Pearson and Achieve3000). EBT sends lead teachers to monthly PD sessions hosted by Superintendent’s 
office. Topics of PD have included effective class management; writing rigorous class objectives; following 5-30-10 
model for student-centered instruction; planning around the Common Core and creating CCSS-based unit plans; using 
Danielson’s Framework for Teaching to focus on areas of pedagogy; and using different protocols for analyzing 
student work. Teachers are sent to professional conferences such as National Conference for Teachers of English 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          34

4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
● Teachers work collaboratively on formative and summative assessments given as part of the curriculum. Summative 
assessments are standardized across common classes (so all English 9 students take the same final exam, for 
example). Teachers use old Regents examinations, resources from Castlelearning.com and other external sources to 
create assessments. Teachers meet in common prep meetings to review results of assessments and plan instruction 
based on results. 

● Teachers perform test item data analyses in order to address student needs and design appropriate subsequent 
assessments. For example, if students are having difficulty understanding vocabulary through content, future 
assessments can focus on vocabulary. 

● Data analyses can also identify student deficiencies that can be addressed via targeted professional development 
workshops. For example, teachers can learn how to effectively teach students to make inferences based on a text. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          35 

 

● In-house professional development provided to teachers to understand and utilize the new NYC Periodic 
Assessment tools. 

● Professional development provided to teachers (by instructors from CITE) on how to tie formative assessment to 
lesson planning; PD provided by Superintendent’s office on how to use Common Core standards to develop 
assessments, then work backwards to plan curriculum targeted towards those standards and assessments. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          36 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

Educational research shows a positive correlation between effective parental involvement and student achievement. 
The overall aim of this policy is to develop a parent involvement program that will ensure effective involvement of 
parents and community in the school. The High School for Enterprise, Business and Technology, in compliance with 
the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is responsible for creating and 
implementing a parent involvement policy to strengthen the connection and support of student achievement 
between the school and the families. The school’s policy is designed to keep parents informed by actively involving 
them in planning and decision-making in support of the education of their children. Parents are encouraged to 
actively participate on the School Leadership Team, Parent Association, and Title I Parent Committee as trained 
volunteers and welcomed members of the school community. 

 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

The High School for Enterprise, Business and Technology will support parents and families of Title I students by: 

 

● providing materials and training to help parents work with their children to improve their achievement level, e.g., 
literacy, math, and use of technology; 

● providing parents with the information and training needed to effectively become involved in planning and decision 
making in support of the education of their children; 

● fostering a caring and effective home-school partnership to ensure that parents can effectively support and monitor 
their child’s progress; 

● providing assistance to parents in understanding City, State and Federal standards and assessments; 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          38 

 

● sharing information about school and parent related programs, meetings and other activities in a format, and in 
languages that parents can understand; 

● providing professional development opportunities for school staff with the assistance of parents to improve 
outreach, communication skills and cultural competency in order to build stronger ties between parents and other 
members of the school community. 

 

Parental Involvement and School Quality 

The school’s Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the needs of all 
parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with disabilities. The 
school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent involvement 
policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of the school. The findings of the evaluation through school 
surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of parents, and 
enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school.  

 

In developing the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the 
school’s Parent Association (or Parent-Teacher Association), as well as parent members of the School Leadership 
Team, were consulted on the proposed Title I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for 
additional input. To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, the school will: 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the School Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to the school to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as 
described in the school’s Parent Involvement Policy and the School-Parent Compact; 

● support school-level committees that include parents who are members of the School Leadership Team, the Parent 
Association (or Parent-Teacher Association) and Title I Parent Committee. This includes providing technical support 
and ongoing professional development, especially in developing leadership skills;  

● maintain a Parent Coordinator (or a dedicated staff person) to serve as a liaison between the school and families.

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

 

School-Parent Compact (SPC) 

The High School for Enterprise, Business and Technology , in compliance with the Section 1118 of Title I, Part A of the 
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), is implementing a School-Parent Compact to strengthen the connection and 
support of student achievement between the school and the families. Staff and parents of students participating in

Title III Supplemental Program for ELLs for the 2018-19 SY 
Directions: Title III supplemental services for ELLs must include all of the following three components: 

 

 

  Direct instruction: activities must be used to support language development, English and native language instruction, high 

academic achievement in math, and/or other core academic areas.  

o  The Title III supplemental instructional services must be based on student need 
o  These supplemental services should complement core bilingual and ESL services required under CR Part 154.  
o  Direct supplemental services should be provided for before school, after school, and Saturday programs. 
o  Teachers providing the services must be certified bilingual education and/or ESL teachers.   

  High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 

the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  

o  Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 

workshops and conferences.  

  Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 

community needs.   

o  These are in addition to mandated activities, such as parent orientation during ELL identification process.  

 
NOTE: The Title III program planning ratio is as follows: 60% direct to instruction, 10% to parental involvement, 10% to professional 
development, and 20% to OTPS.   
  
For more information on Title III requirements, please see the School Allocation Memo or contact your Senior ELL Compliance and

Begin description here:            
 
The  High School for Enterprise, Business, and Technology uses Title III funds to help students 
develop their language and academic skills, increase parental support, and provide teachers with 
ongoing professional development. The Title III fund is also used to provide students with 
additional educational resources and opportunities.  
We design our instructional programs to serve the educational needs of our English Language 
Learners.  The Title III program supplements our core transitional bilingual and free standing 
ENL programs that currently serve 98 students in grades 9-12.  Our Transitional Bilingual 
Education program follows the New York State recommended guidelines: Beginners, 
30% English, 70% Spanish; Intermediate, 50% English, 50% Spanish; Advanced, 70% English, 
30% Spanish. Our Free Standing ENL program meets the state mandates for minutes required 
per week: 
Entering and Emerging ELLs get 540 minutes of total ENL instructional time, which includes 
180 minutes of standalone ENL + 360 minutes integrated ENL (ENL/ELA or other core content 
area). Transitioning and Expanding ELLs receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL. 
Although our day programs meet the mandated service time for the ELLs, the diversity of the 
ELL subgroups served in our school requires additional support which we plan to offer during 
the  two sessions, fall and spring, of the Saturday Institute and after school program. The 
Saturday classes and after school sessions will address the linguistic and academic needs of 
newly arrived ELLs recently enrolled in the New York Public schools, long term 
ELLs  struggling to exit the program, students preparing for the mandated Regents, ELLs who 
have fallen behind academically, and students with interrupted formal education (SIFE). 
The focus of the Direct Instruction Supplemental Program is to help students achieve proficiency 
in core content literacy, as well as in each of the four modalities of the English language: 
listening, speaking, reading and writing. With this proficiency as well as computer competency, 
students will be equipped with college and career readiness skills. 
Additionally, the goals of the Saturday and after school programs are; to accelerate language 
acquisition, to fill in academic gaps and boost academic growth aligned with the common core 
benchmarks in all content areas, as well as to prepare students for 21st century college and career 
demands. The Title III program’s objectives are to provide access to technology and other 
resources, guided support and practice for the Regents exams, develop test taking strategies and 
study skills based on needs assessment and individualized planning, and to expose ELLs to 
cultural and civic aspects of our school community,  neighborhood, and New York City. 
The after school program will meet for 1.5 hours (2 periods) on a weekly basis. Students will be 
provided with extra help for classroom assignments (tutoring), as well as guidance and 
mentoring, and will have access to computers. Additionally, we will include educational trips 
near school, as well as social and fun academic activities, such as science experiments, computer 
games like Kahoot, Quizizz and "Cool math games" as well as board games like Pictionary, 
chess and Soduku.

Part B: Direct Instruction Supplemental Program Information  
Our after school program will begin in October and run through the end of May. Teachers will be 
licensed ENL teachers with "guest appearances" by Global Studies, Math and Science teachers, 
Including the bilingual Mr. Vergara, Ms. Montano, Mr. Jaquez and Mr. Benson. 
Parents are invited and encouraged to participate to all activities as chaperons and have their 
admission fees and transportation covered. 
Furthermore, we  teach students the importance of becoming active participants in their own 
language learning. Through this supplemental program, we  emphasize the need for each student 
to know his or her own learning style (visual, auditory or kinesthetic) and cognitive 
style.  Students are taught how to assess their own strengths and areas in need of growth.  This 
can be accomplished by showing students how to target skills that need to be sharpened through 
the use of formative and summative  assessments (e.g., unit exams, reading conferences, teacher 
feedback, etc.). 
In addition to the main focus of the courses mentioned above, time is allotted to address the 
academic needs of small  groups and individual students through direct instruction and web 
based  programs such as Newsela and Castle Learning. 
The curricula for English Language Learners (ELLs) in both the Free Standing and the 
Transitional Bilingual Education Programs are aligned with New York State Standards and 
Common Core Learning Standards.  In order to assist ELLs in demonstrating proficiency of 
these standards, we need the Direct Instruction Supplemental Program. 
For the Saturday Institute, first priority is given to our Entering and Emerging ELLs and students 
who did not show growth on the NYSESLAT last spring.  However, the program is open to the 
ELLs in all subgroups across all grade levels (9, 10, 11, and 12). Instruction will be differentiated 
based on the individual needs of each student.  
Although co-teaching is possible, generally students will move to whichever class/teacher they 
need support in (such as ELA, math or social studies). Students will be seated in small groups or 
pairs which will be homogeneous or heterogeneous depending on the activity, unless students are 
taking a practice exam, in which case they will sit individually. We will strive for a teacher to 
student ratio of 1:20 or less per content area. The most common model will be parallel teaching, 
but co/team teaching is not impossible depending on student attendance and needs. 
In addition, students have the opportunity to participate in cultural immersion activities, such as 
attending Metropolitan Opera performances in person or broadcast into EBT’s auditorium and 
visiting museums throughout New York City, such as the Museum of Modern Art.   
The primary language of instruction for the programs is English.  In addition, Spanish is 
frequently used to facilitate students' understanding of the material. 
There are 6 teachers in this program who help ELLs with their acquisition of the English 
language, one certified bilingual social studies teacher (Montano),  three ENL certified teachers 
(Goodman, Jungkurth & new hire) and three bilingual content teachers (Correa, Montano and 
new math hire or Lara). There will be one supervisor on site for administrative and instructional 
support. 
Materials will include classroom texts and online programs such as Castlelearning, Duolingo and 
NewsELA. Such software provides students with authentic language contexts and native speech 
and real-life social and cultural situations that will help students move more effectively toward 
English language proficiency. Mobile computer and Itablet carts will be available to students 
after school and on Saturdays. Additionally, supplementary materials that are used for the 
extended-day programs and the LL component of our Saturday Institute will include  Getting 
Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond, Kaplan ELA Regents Prep books, bilingual 
dictionaries, picture dictionaries, as well as Visions textbooks and workbooks and classroom 
libraries.

Begin description here:            
All the teachers of ELL students  in our school will have an increased opportunity to improve their practice, 
deepen content/subject knowledge and increase their understanding of student needs and strengths.  
The two teachers running the Saturday program are members of the ENL/Bilingual department of the EBT 
High School and are active participants to the professional development opportunities offered on an ongoing 
basis in our school, including departmental opportunities that occur every Friday. 
In addition to the workshops and professional development sessions scheduled in school during Chancellor 
PD days, the Title III program teachers will take turns participating in primarily FREE workshops and 
conferences offered by the UFT, OELL, NYSABE, RBERN and others that showcase best practices in 
working with bilingual and ENL students. Attending teachers will turnkey to the rest of our faculty during 
weekly common planning and professional development sessions.  For example, "Long-term ELLs" is an 
RBern offering that our ENL Department teachers will attend and share with colleagues. The teachers will 
also continue to be involved in sustained professional development in study groups and team and department 
meetings implementing strategies and techniques acquired via other outlets, such as webinars offered by 
Newsela, Duolingo, etc. 
Monolingual teachers dealing with recently transitioned former ELLs will continue to be trained on issues 
related to native language and ENL instruction. ENL teachers will continue to receive training on enhancing 
instruction through the use of technology and teaching ENL through content to develop academic language.  
The professional development sessions will be facilitated by Ms. Goodman (ENL Coordinator), Ms. 
Jungkurth (ENL Teacher)  Ms. Montano (Bilingual Global Studies Teacher), and other faculty members and 
guests at EBT. EBT Teachers to receive training will vary per topic but may include: Ms. Iglesias, English 
Teacher, Ms. Fahrner, ENL/English teacher, Mr. Benson, Math teacher, Ms. Ognibene, Living Environment 
teacher, Dr. Irikura, Living Environment teacher, Mr. Vergara, Global Studies teacher, and Mr. Day, English 
teacher. 
ENL/Bilingual Department meetings will occur weekly and attendance, agenda & minutes will be shared 
online via GoogleDocs. 
We believe these opportunities will positively impact the progress of ELLs by fostering teacher collaboration, 
usage of creative differentiation strategies and instilling confidence in teachers.

topics to be covered 

Begin description here:            
Parents of English Language Learners are encouraged to be involved in our school and are made 
to feel welcome and empowered. They are included and encouraged to participate in all school 
wide events organized by and for the parents of EBT. They can participate in the PA  meetings 
and take part in the design and implementation of our school educational plan. All documents 
and letters are translated and at school wide events such as Family Night, Open School Night, 
and award ceremonies the school provides translation services, using our translation resources 
and multilingual staff members as interpreters.. 
EBT has an established Parent Association (PA) that meets on a monthly basis and addresses the 
needs of all parents, including the parents of ELLs.  In October and May/June, we host an open 
house for all parents. During the open house, parents  participate in a tour, observe classes, and 
meet the faculty and staff.  In addition, parents have the opportunity to accompany their children 
on the student-led walking tours that are part of the Saturday program as well as class trips 
including Broadway shows. There are also  opportunities for all parents to participate in other 
events such as  school performances, and educational field trips such as college visits. In 
addition, parents are encouraged  to help in the planning and supervision of school events.      
Additional services offered to the parents of ELLs include the presence of an interpreter at 
meetings, the translation of letters (into the home language indicated on the HLIS) sent home and 
the use of the Department of Education translation unit.  
In addition, the needs of parents are addressed at school events such as PA meetings and Open 
School Night/Afternoon.  Furthermore, Principal Carrillo and his administration maintain an 
open door policy in order to facilitate effective communication with parents.   
Parents are provided with information about resources available to them and their community 
such as health clinics, immigration services, arts organizations, GED programs, English classes, 
etc.  
The parents of the ELLs participating in the after school and Saturday Institutes are invited and 
encouraged to chaperon their children during field trips, observe classes, and meet the EBT 
faculty and staff.  
In addition, the parents of the Saturday Institute students will attend a workshop on how to help 
their children with homework. They will also get their own Jupitergrades.com and Newsela.com 
accounts to monitor their children's progress and/or to improve their own English language 
skills. 
  
Parents will be notified of (invited to) relevant activities via  mailings, email messages 
and/phone calls translated to parents' preferred languages, as well as handouts given to students 
in class. 
 
Records of attendance, meeting agenda will be maintained on a Google Doc and a hard copy will 
be kept in the ENL Office.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Early literacy skills of the ELLs at the EBT HS are assessed through a variety of methods. During the admission process parents 
and students are interviewed with comprehensive questions covering their education background history and possible SIFE 
status, using questions from the SIFE Identification Questionnaire.  Students are given the NYSITELL.state exam, and Spanish 
speakers are administered the Spanish LAB. Literacy skills are further assessed by the ENL classroom teachers using the results 
from the Level Test administered as part of the Achieve 3000 program used in our school as well as from CastleLearning data. 
Another source of student literacy assessment comes from the analysis of ATS reports such as the ELA and MATH tests results. 
Furthermore, initial and ongoing conferencing with content area teachers sharing the flagged students allow for a deeper 
understanding of the ELLs first and second language needs. Additional information used for planning and instructional 
implementation is provided by the item analysis of the NYSESLAT modalities, as well as the regents results (REDS). A closer 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          54 

 

look at the data indicates that a large majority of our students perform well below grade level in Reading and need help in 
developing structured writing skills.   
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Besides being assigned a bilingual guidance counselor/grade adviser, students have access to both ENL teachers at a weekly 
after school tutoring program as well as during school hours.  Additionally, each semester a 5-10 week Saturday Institute is 
offered to provide students additional educational support and access to technology.  To support the efforts of the Ms. 
Goodman, the ENL Coordinator, Mr. Eddie Cantos in the main office has been assigned to assist with initial testing of incoming 
ELL students. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
We are continuing our effort to close the gap between the ELLs and the mainstream students in our school.  In addition to 
content area benchmarks and other assessments, the ELL Periodic Assessment is used to identify student baseline, progress 
and areas of need. ENL teachers design instruction to fill highest need areas, and provide additional scaffolding and support for 
needy students. 
 
Additionally, from the ATS REDS report, we see the low rate of ELLs passing the ELA Regents as an alert signal for our team to 
focus on improving the preparation of our students for the exam. The general effort towards aligning ENL instruction and 
assessment tools with the common core is helping in that direction.  
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

We have begun using the EDAT (ELL Data Analysis Tool with Advanced Early Warning  Indicators), to focus on the progress 
toward achievement of proficiency for specific subgroups of ELLs, and to design effective instructional programs and targeted 
interventions for those students.  By assigning the responsibility to Teacher teams (such as content + ENL teachers) as well as 
guidance counselors, ENL Coordinator and ISS Coordinator, student progress is reviewed each marking period to assess the 
need for additional interventions or changes. 
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
N/A   
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
According to 2017 NYSESLAT data analysis, 136 students are eligible for ENL services at our school, with  37% 
scoring COMMANDING(proficient). This includes 2015 results since we are to service students for up to 2 years after they pass 
the exam. Of the Commanding students, 13 are in the 9th grade, 13 in 10th grade, 6 in 11th grade, and 8 in the 12th grade.  
 
For the remaining ELLs, the NYSESLAT and NYSITELL results indicate that the numbers of students scoring at the Entering, 
Emerging, Transitioning and Expanding levels are spread across the grades in a relatively balanced manner with a few remarks: 
Another evident trend of the past two years that appears from the data is the decreasing number and percentage of incoming 
SIFE students, which should make academic success more probably amongst our ELL population. In the past we have found it 
quite challenging for SIFE students to graduate by the 21 year age deadline. 
 
Finally, as per ATS RLER, more than 20% of the total ELL population are long term ELLs with years of service between 7-12 
years. Most specifically,  our students with special needs tend to exhibit little improvement in NYSESLAT scores over the years. 
These numbers raise questions in terms of curricular and instructional decisions aimed to meet remedial, grade specific, and 
graduation needs of the assessed students, as well as compliance with CR-part 154.2. The students' needs will be identified 
and addressed case by case during guidance counselor/program adviser conferences.  
 
Additionally, as for all students, Regents scores inform ELL programming; in general, students who have not passed a core

content Regents exam will be reprogrammed for relevant courses in order to support success. 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

ENL Coordinator Lori Goodman is responsible for periodically running ATS reports such as RLAT and RESI and compiling 
information in the EDAT and sharing this information with guidance counselors and administrators.  Each semester this 
information is used to ensure appropriate programming 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

The High School for Enterprise, Business and Technology (EBT) follows a self-contained (stand alone) organizational 
model where students who share the same language requirements are heterogeneously programmed in the 
classroom according to a mixture of English proficiency levels (Entering, Emerging, Transitioning, Expanding & 
Commanding). This model creates a more positive and supportive environment for meeting both the academic and 
social-emotional needs of each child. Students in the Free Standing ENL program take general education classes 
appropriate for their grade level.  Additionally, this year again, we are instituting an Integrated ENL model, AKA “Push-
in” / Collaborative teaching model, wherein ENL teachers are pushing into content area classes and co-teaching. This 
is necessary due to the new CR part 154.2 changes. Instruction for ELLs is delivered in several ways to accommodate 
the individual learning styles of each child (e.g., visual, auditory and kinesthetic). Instruction models for ELLs rely 
heavily on the workshop model approach, collaborative learning model, differentiated instruction, and Howard 
Gardner’s multiple intelligence modalities. Emphasis is placed on the four modalities of language learning: listening, 
speaking, reading, and writing, and teachers are encouraged to "SWIRL" (speaking, writing, interacting, reading and 
listening) all lessons. The program model that is used for incomer ENL instruction within the Free Standing ENL 
program and program is a homogeneous model in which Entering and Emerging students are programmed for 
standalone ENL classes according to their respective proficiency levels as determined by the NYSITELL and the New 
York State English as a Second Language Assessment Test (NYSESLAT).   

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Students in the TBE program take both bilingual classes in the core content areas (e.g., math, science, and social 
studies) and general education classes (e.g., physical education, music, and art) and are programmed heterogeneously 
regardless of proficiency level. They are homogeneously programmed to 1 period of standalone ENL according to their 
NYSITELL or NYSESLAT placement.  Additionally, they are provided NLA and bilingual content area classes as 
per  NYSITELL or NYSESLAT placement. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

EBT has compiled a team that is in charge of the scheduling and placement of all ELLs within their chosen program model. The 
team consists of the ENL coordinator, 4 guidance counselors, the school programmer and the ISS Coordinator. As per NYS CR 
Part 154.2 guidelines, students are placed according to their program model (TBE or standalone ENL and their proficiency level 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          56 

 

as determined by the NYSITELL and/or the NYSESLAT. The ENL coordinator identifies the student’s program model and 
proficiency level by reviewing each student’s parent survey, program selection form, entitlement letter, and NYSESLAT results. 
Once a student’s proficiency level and program choice have been determined, the school programmer, in consultation with 
the ENL coordinator, create classes that support the mandated number of units for grades 9-12 that will accommodate all 
proficiency levels from Entering to Commanding within the TBE and Free Standing ENL Program models. Once the required 
number of classes have been created, then the guidance counselors for each grade level, in consultation with the school 
programmer, place each ELL in the appropriate classes according to the mandated number of units that their proficiency level 
and program model mandates. When all students are programmed into their respective classes, the ENL coordinator reviews 
each student’s program to ensure that the mandated number of units is in compliance with NYS CR Part 154.2 guidelines. a. 
ENL instruction is required for all ELLs as mandated under CR Part 154. Regardless of program choice, all students are 
programmed for ENL instruction according to their proficiency level as determined by the NYSESLAT test results.  
  
•     Entering ELL students receive at least 3 units of study or 540 minutes per week as follows:  
o     1 period of standalone ENL instruction five days per week for a total of 225 minutes per week (45 x 5 = 225 minutes); 
o     1 unit of study of integrated ENL (such as co-teaching in Social Studies, Math or Science, 45 x 4 = 180 minutes) 
o     1 unit of “Flexible” integrated ENL in content area (interpreted as co-teaching by 2 individually certified teachers in Social 
Studies, Math or Science, 45 x 3 = 135 minutes) 
  
•     Emerging ELL students receive at least 2 units of study or 360 minutes per week as follows:  
o     1 period of standalone ENL instruction five days per week for a total of 225 minutes per week (45 x 3 = 135 minutes); 
o     1 unit of study of integrated ENL, i.e. ENL/ELA  (such as co-teaching in Social Studies, Math or Science, 45 x 3 = 135 
minutes) 
o     .5 unit of “Flexible” integrated ENL in content area (such as co-teaching in Social Studies, Math or Science OR standalone 
ENL/ 45 x 3 = 135 minutes) 
  
•     Transitioning ELL students receive at least 1 unit of study or 180 minutes per week as follows:  
o     NO standalone ENL instruction   
o     .5 unit of study of integrated ENL/Content area (such as co-teaching in Social Studies, Math or Science OR 1 dually certified 
ELA/ENL teacher;  45 x 2 = 225 minutes) 
o     .5 unit of “Flexible” integrated ENL in content area (such as co-teaching in Social Studies, Math or Science, 45 x 2 = 90 
minutes)  
  
•     Expanding ELL students receive at least 1 unit of study or 180 minutes per week as follows:  
o     NO standalone ENL instruction   
o     1 unit of study of integrated ENL/Content area (such as co-teaching in Social Studies, Math or Science OR 1 dually certified 
ELA/ENL teacher;  45 x 4 = 180 minutes) 
  
•     Commanding ELL students receive at least .5 unit of study or 90 minutes per week (for 2 years after passing the NYSESLAT) 
as follows:  
o     .5 units of “Flexible” integrated ENL in content area (such as ENL teacher co-teaching in Social Studies, Math or Science, 45 
x 2 = 90 minutes) 
  
All students who are in the TBE program also receive 45 minutes of native language arts per day in addition to ENL instruction 
outlined in the preceding bullet points. 
  
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
EBT believes in engaging students in collaborative learning as a means to raise student achievement and improve language 
development. Academic rigor is encouraged by creating curriculum maps that include essential questions, clear learning 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          57 

 

targets, challenging tasks aligned with Common Core Standards, content-based vocabulary, a variety of formative and 
summative assessments, and appropriate text and additional resources proven effective in acquiring content mastery (e.g., 
graphic organizers, visuals, manipulatives, etc.). Lastly, the strategic grouping of students (based on both qualitative and 
quantitative data) facilitates their comprehension of content in classes. The following instructional approaches and methods, 
aligned with Common Core Learning Standards and New York State ENL Standards, are emphasized:  
o     Achieve3000 and Castle Learning guided reading and writing activities  
o     Collaborative team projects based on clearly defined tasks and assessed with the use of rubrics  
o     Listening and speaking activities in the classroom based on the principles of accountable talk  
o     Reading and writing activites in ENL, ELA, and Native Language Arts classes such as: 
•     Use of graphic organizers as tools to guide students through historically challenging tasks such as essay writing  
•     Read Aloud-Think Aloud-Talk-Aloud (RA-TA-TA) and  
•     Independent Reading (IR) sessions    
  
   The Free Standing ENL content area classes are taught in English and students are encouraged to transfer the language skills 
from their first language to the target tanguage, English. Students may use their native language for clarification of ideas and 
understanding but strong emphasis is placed on English usage in all of the modalities. The foundation of the ENL program is 
grounded in socio-cultural learning theory (the Zone of Proximal Development and scaffolding theory). In addition, teachers of 
ELLs a wide array of in-class and online assessment strategies to gauge students’ levels of comprehension. Online resources for 
learning and assessing include We are NY web series (nyc.gov), Castlelearning and Achieve3000, while texts include the Visions 
series (Thompson), Readers Notebook English Learner’s Versions (Prentice Hall), and leveled readers by Houghton Mifflin.  In 
additional, Oxford and Word by Word Basic (Pearson) picture as well as bilingual dictionaries and glossaries are used and 
encouraged.  Lessons come from the content areas as well as English literature and news, and ENL teacher provides support 
via pre-teaching vocabulary, collaborative learning and bilingual glossaries and assignments. 
  
       In the TBE program, content area instruction is provided in the native language, as are resources (such as Pearson’s La 
Historia Del Mundo and Castlelearning online (students can see questions in English an/dor Spanish). English is used in a 
systematic and structured manner that is designed to develop the cognitive skills of ELLs. The focus of the TBE program is for 
ELLs to maintain and strengthen the strong language skills of their first language while transferring these skills to the second 
language. Achieve3000, Castlelearning, graphic organizers and accountable talk are  some of the resources used by our TBE 
teachers and students. 
  
 

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

   PELLs are appropriately evaluated in their native language through teacher-generated language assessments and on-line 
diagnositc exams such as the Pearson Diagnostic and Achieve3000 lexile level (in Spanish mode). Castlelearning is another 
online resource which includes Regents questions in Spanish, and is available for all EBT teachers. 
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

Each ELL group is as unique as each student in the sub-group. That stated, available data is analyzed for trends to identify 
strengths and areas for growth. A comprehensive plan that differentiates instruction according to the needs of each is then 
developed. Page 33 a. Plan for Students with Interrupted Formal Education (SIFE) The instructional plan for SIFE focuses on 
intensive English language instruction that teaches both social and academic language. English language instruction is given in 
a block schedule format to maximize continuous instruction. SIFE students follow a thematically organized curriculum with 
fewer topics that concentrates on depth of knowledge rather than the breadth of multiple topics. In addition to receiving ENL 
services, SIFE students receive additional support through Title III after school programs to support reading and writing 
fluency. The plan also consists of tracking down any available transcripts from past schools, holding a meeting with the 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          58 

 

student, guardian, guidance counselor and ENL teacher and requiring attendance at after-school and Saturday classes in 
addition to scheduled meetings every three months to assess student progress within the school. SIFE are also administered 
the Pearson Periodic Assessment to assess their proficiency levels in listening, reading, and writing.  
b. Plan for ELLs in school less than 3 years/ Newcomers After being NYSITELL tested, students are given the appropriate 
schedule. The focus for newcomers is learn the routines, rituals, and best practices of academically successful students. 
Students are encouraged to develop their reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills through a variey of interesting and 
engaging activities both in and out of the classroom. Students use both Achieve3000 and Castle Learning to increase their 
literacy. In addition, they are encouraged to participate in after-school activities and Saturday tutoring programs. Finally, 
Newcomers are administered the Pearson Periodic Assessment to assess their proficiency levels in listening, reading, and 
writing.  
c. Plan for ELLs in school 4-6 years The focus for this group is primarily reading and writing skills. Strategies to improve reading 
and writing skills include the following: use of classroom libraries; teaching strategies that build on current cognitive abilities 
and background knowledge; demystifying the reading portion of the NYSESLAT by creating exercises and exams that follow the 
test format; encouraging participation in afterschool and Saturday programs; and using computer soiftware programs such as 
Achieve3000 and Castle Learning. Finally, ELLS in school for 4-6 years are administered the Pearson Periodic Assessment to 
assess their proficiency levels in listening, reading, and writing.  
d. Plan for ELLs in school 6 years completed or more / Long Term ELLs For long-term ELLs, additional instructional support is 
offered through the Achieve3000 and Castle Learning programs and by providing individualized remedial instruction during the 
Lunch and Learn program, after-school tutoring programs, and on Saturdays. For students reaching proficiency, they will be 
gradually placed in general education classes according to the transitional support plan. Long Term ELLs are administered the 
Pearson Periodic Assessment to assess their proficiency levels in listening, reading, and writing.  
e. Plan for former ELLs For two years after their exiting the program, former ELLs are benefiting from all test accomodations 
current ELLs are entitled to ; extended time, bilingual dictionaries and glossaries, and three readings for the ELA Regents. 
General ed / mainstream teachers are made aware of the status of former ELLs and use differentiated approaches to ease the 
adjustment of former ELLs to the new learning environment and new peers. As per CR Part 154.2, those scoring Commanding 
on the NYSESLAT receive 90 minutes per week of mandated services for two years after exiting ELL status. 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs who are identified as having special needs are provided special education programs and services in accordance with their 
individualized education program (IEP) in addition to ENL services aligned with their proficiency level and accordance with CR 
Part 154 regulations. Students with an IEP are programmed into CTT classes, in which they are given special attention by both 
the content-area teacher and a special education teacher or para-professional. The special education teacher meets with an 
ENL teacher to confirm that she has any necessary materials to make content understandable to the ELL student. ISS admin is 
responsible for ensuring all SWDs receive services mandated on the their IEPs, while ENL Coordinator ensures compliance as 
per NYSESLAT/CR-154 (i.e. ELL-SWDs receive ENL and/or bilingual instruction as per NYSESLAT level and parent program 
preference).  ELLs with special needs are also administered the Pearson Periodic Assessment to assess their proficiency levels 
in listening, reading, and writing. Lastly, the guidance counselors routinely evaluate the transcripts of ELLs with an IEP. 
Achieve3000 non-fiction reading software is employed to help ELL-SWD students understand content at their grade level but 
at a customized reading level. 
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
  
In order to ensure that ELL/SWDs benefit from scheduling flexibility as recommended by their IEPs, the program office, the ENL 
Coordinator, and the ISS grade adviser work together to give priority in programming to these student groups. Students are 
 scheduled for the appropriate classes and instruction is guided by each student's IEP goals. As mandated by the Individual 
Education Program students receive services based on their individual needs following the continuum of a lest restictive 
environment as recommended by the IEP.Curriculum maps in all content areas suggest modifications guided by the UDL 
principles meant to facilitate learning for diverse student groups including ELL/SWDs. Teachers also use extensive 
differentiation of instruction that links to the varied learning styles of the individual students.  Whenever possible, flexible 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

programming is used to maximize time spent with non-disabled peers.   Starting with the IEP, programming requirements, 
interviewing the student and finally with the best judgment of ISS/ENL teachers & administrators, decisions are made on 
how/when to place ELL-SWDs in ICT classes.  
  
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
Data collected from ARIS, Regents results, RLAT, Achieve 3000 reports, teacher assessment, anecdotal notes, and attendance 
records are analyzed by teams of ENL and content area teachers during common prep time in order to identify and plan 
effective intervention addressed to the needs of different groups of students. Data is used to design individualized and group 
instruction , facilitate parent communication, and to make appropriate referrals to other services. Our goal is to get 
interventions for the students as soon as possible. Ultimately, we hope that through interventions students will reach their 
true academic potential. All teachers attend workshops throughout the year on UDL, and ENL methodology meant to address 
specific needs of all groups. 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

In the past, we purchased the CCLS aligned Achieve3000 software program for use in low level ENL classes and for after-school 
and Saturday tutoring programs. Based on data, this year EBT is not making this investment of time and money to purchase 
and use this program again as a direct result of less than stellar feedback that we have received from students and teachers. 
We are considering the more economical (free) version of NewsELA to replace the reading program of Achieve3000. 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have not closed our bilingual program. However, we will discontinue using the old NYSESLAT prep books as the new test is 
different and the books are less relevant.    
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
All students at EBT have full and equal access to all school programs and extra-curricular activities ELLs are encouraged to 
participate in all physical, social, and academic activities, such as the International Academic and Scholarship Klub (I.A.S.K.) 
and sports teams. ELLs are also encouraged to form any clubs that may be of particular interest to them. Students must follow 
the rules and guidelines for extra curricular activities and all groups and/or clubs have equal access to meeting spaces, school 
periodicals, bulletin board space, etc.  
 

12.  What instructional materials, including technology, are used to support ELLs? Include core content area as well as language 

materials; list ELL subgroups if necessary. 
In additiona to Scholastic Scope, Action and classroom magazines, materials used in the classroom include class packs of 
Visions, KAPLAN Regents Prep, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and Beyond; Azar grammar workbooks and accompanying 
materials; and Word by Word picture dictionaries, Oxford Picture dictionaries, with accompanying workbooks, Class library 
with level readers, multimedia materials, and teacher’s guides. In addition, a mobile laptop cart consisting of 20 laptops is 
currently being shared by the two ENL teachers. Each content department is responsible for having materials appropriate to 
the learning level of its students. For ELLs, these include textbooks in their native language, reading materials—including text 
and trade books—at lower reading grade levels. Subject area teachers are required to have word walls of content-specific 
vocabulary, to help lower level readers, including ELLs, with any necessary vocabulary. ELLs with special needs are provided 
with materials that are specified in the Individualized Education Plan (IEP). Materials that are specific to the student’s disability 
and/or special need is evaluated by the special education teacher and the ESL teacher and then provided to the student. 
Materials for content area subjects are also evaluated and provided to the student. 
 

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

In the Freestanding ENL program, the ESL teachers meet with the content area teachers to incorporate teaching strategies and 
activities that connect English and native language within their lessons to support ELLs within their classrooms. In addition, 
every content area classroom is provided with bilingual dictionaries and glossaries. In the ENL classrooms, students are 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          60 

 

encouraged to read books in both English and their native language during independent reading. Lastly, all ELLs are provided 
with bilingual text in all of their content area classes. In the transitional bilingual education program, students receive 45 
minutes of native language instruction daily in addition to ENL instruction. The work of the native language instructor 
complements the work done in the ENL program, and teachers from both programs meet on a regular basis to discuss 
classroom strategies and ideas for cultural events that complement the curriculum. All content area classrooms have bilingual 
dictionaries and glossaries. The transitional bilingual education program builds students’ English language skills and uses native 
language instruction in the service of learning English. Typically, instruction in the native language tapers off as ELLs’ English 
language skills increase and students can access English language instruction more easily.  
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

All materials, services, and resources that are used with the ELL population are reviewed to make sure that they are age and 
grade level appropriate. Furthermore, instruction is differentiated according to content, process and product. Lessons are 
planned with consideration to individual learning and conative styles. Students also have the multiple opportunities to select 
readings or texts that are interesting to them (e.g. Achieve3000 articles and independent reading books). 17 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
Materials used in the classroom include class packs of Visions, KAPLAN Regents Prep, Getting Ready for the NYSESLAT and 
Beyond; Azar grammar workbooks and accompanying materials; and Word by Word picture dictionaries, Oxford Picture 
dictionaries, with accompanying workbooks, Class library with level readers, multimedia materials, and teacher’s guides. In 
addition, a mobile laptop cart consisting of 20 laptops is currently being shared by the two ESL teachers. Each content 
department is responsible for having materials appropriate to the learning level of its students. For ELLs, these include 
textbooks in their native language, reading materials—including text and trade books—at lower reading grade levels. Subject 
area teachers are required to have word walls of content-specific vocabulary, to help lower level readers, including ELLs, with 
any necessary vocabulary. ELLs with special needs are provided with materials that are specified in the Individualized 
Education Plan (IEP). Materials that are specific to the student’s disability and/or special need is evaluated by the special 
education teacher and the ESL teacher and then provided to the student. Materials for content area subjects are also 
evaluated and provided to the student. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
Typically the ENL teachers are responsible for assisting new students upon matriculation. School counselors are also somewhat 
involved as they review and make program changes after conferencing with students. The beginning of the year focuses on 
creating a classroom community, reviewing rules, roles and responsibilities and interviewing one another and presenting to 
the class. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At the present time, the only language elective offered at EBT is Spanish  
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 
c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
Our ENL teachers and hopefully our CPE will provide professional development seminars that address the needs of ELLs. 
Workshops are offered during faculty and department meetings as well as during days designated by the DOE as professional 
development days. The focus of the professional development is to make teachers aware of the different needs and learning 
styles they will encounter with ELLs, and to show teachers how to use such techniques as differentiated instruction, the 
workshop model to educate our ELLs, and best practices for co-teaching strategies and integrating language and content 
instruction for English language learners. In addition, ELL teachers will receive professional development during common 
planning time, lunch, before or after school for each of the topics below:   
-OCTOBER: Online Diagnostic assessment tools (Achieve3000, Castlelearning, etc.) 
-NOVEMBER: Designing coherent instruction 
-DECEMBER: Planning based on Danielson's framework 
-JANUARY Citywide instructional expectations & Instructional shifts 10/11  
-FEBRUARY:  NYSESLAT 
-MARCH: Teaching students to think : the teaching channel, Learning to think, a foundation for analysis-Scaffolding. 
https://www.teachingchannel.org/videos/teach-students 
tothink?utm_campaign=digest&utm_medium=email&utm_source=digest, Implementing Bloom's taxonomy in the ESL 
classroom and much more. 
-APRIL: Taking Regents in 2 languages? 
-MAY: Preparing for Regents 
  
Additionally, our ENL teachers will also attend the following professional development courses (at no cost to Title III funds) 
offered by the Department of Education, including:  
-Differentiated Instruction  
-Preparing Students for the NYSESLAT  
-Common Core State Standards and Curriculum Mapping for ELLs  
-Promotional Policy  
-Language Allocation Policy (LAP)  
-Analyzing and planning using AMAO's  
  
  
At EBT HS training and classroom implementation of the CCLS/CCR is an ongoing endeavor. It began during 2011-13 when 
selected teachers attended CFN PDs and turnkeyed to the rest of the staff at in house PDs. Departments developed and 
implemented CCLS unit plans to serve as models. Currently teams of teachers meet weekly within the common prep PDs to 
explore online resources offered by the DOE site, The Teaching Channel, Educators 4 Excellence, School Improvement, PD 360, 
etc., and discuss implementation of the common core for our ELL population. In addition, representative ENL and Bilingual 
teachers from our school attend workshops and training sessions offered by the Office of ELLs and the UFT and turnkey the 
ideas to the rest of the staff. Periodically, at least twice a month, teachers reflect upon and share best practices and thoughts 
about the effectiveness of implementintg ideas and activities discussed during the UDL and Common Core focused workshops. 
 

2.  Describe how your school meets the professional development requirements as per CR Part 154.2: 15% of total hours for all 
teachers and 50% of total hours for bilingual education/ENL teachers receive ELL-specific professional development. Include 
how records are kept for professional development activities (e.g. agendas, attendance).  Refer to ELL Policy and Reference 
Guide, Professional Development section. 
Staff members of all departments including guidance, attend professional development programs for high school teachers that 
help them understand the developmental needs of young adolescents, especially when transitioning from middle school to 
high school. The Guidance, the ENL, and ISS teams participate in workshops to address the programming needs of each 
student based on data provided by NYSESLAT/NYSITELL analysis as well as ATS exam history reports from middle school. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          62 

 

 

The required 15% hours of ELL instruction for all staff (including subject area teachers, guidance counselors, secretaries and 
the parent coordinator) are broken into three portions: three 2.5 hour workshops, one each during the three DOE professional 
development days (Election Day, post-Regents period in January, and Brooklyn-Queens Day). Meetings are run by our ENL 
teachers, and attendance is taken to ensure compliance with this requirement. All agendas and minutes are listed in EBT 
google drive and shared with the staff.   
Additionally, one school or campus wide Friday PD session will be devoted to ELL issues. 
The ENL teachers who require 50% ELL specific PD according to CR Part 154.2, will attend monthly PDs given by the Brooklyn 
North Field Support Center, Hunter College and/or other venues (usually publicized via email from the Board of Ed) 
 
 

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
EBT has many staff members who are fluent in languages other than English.  We are currently able  to assist with the 
translation of documents to parents in the home language indicated on the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) and 
Bilingual Education Student Information Survey (BESIS), Spanish, French, Arabic, and Bengali. 
• Currently, our Native Language Arts teachers, provide translation of written correspondences in Spanish to parents who have 
indicated Spanish as their home language. 
• We will also utilize translation materials made available by the Office of English Language Learners for languages other than 
Spanish, as indicated on the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) and Bilingual Education Student Information Survey 
(BESIS).   
• All students data, including grades comments, assignments , messages to students and parents sent by school staff through 
JUPITER GRADES are automatically translated and available to parents In Spanish. 
The ENL Coordinator, ENL Teacher and all guidance counselors are fluent in Spanish and therefore able to explain to parents in 
person or by phone during individual meetings. 
    

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

Parents are invided to participate in their children's education by monitoring their grades, attendance and assignments via 
Jupitergrades and regual communication with teachers. Additionally, field trips oster parental involvement.  For example, 
parents are invited on field tl Repertorio Espanol, museums or the Metropolitan Opera. Additionally, they are invited to the 
Humanities and Math/Science Fairs. Individual teachers may have parents come in to assist or speak to their children's classes. 
The role of the Parent Coordinator is to encourage increased parental involvement via actions such as phone calls and fliers. 
EBT has partnered with agencies such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Metropolitan Opera, the Museum of Modern Art, 
and the St. Nicholas Preservation Corporation in order to provide workshops or services to ELL parents.  Additionally, parents 
are invited on field trips to El Repertorio Espanol or the Metropolitan Opera. Additionally, they are invited to the Humanities 
and Math/Science Fairs. Individual teachers may have parents come in to assist or speak to their children's classes.  
 

 

 

Additional Information 

Include any additional information that would be relevant to your LAP and would further explain and highlight your program for 
ELLs.  You may attach/submit charts.   This form does not allow graphics and charts to be pasted.   
Our school is migrating toward increased bilingual program participation (TBE) and SIFE students, which we are less prepared for & 
experienced with.  We will need additional support and resources from the Office of English Language Learners and our CPE, 
Tatyana Ulubabova.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Holger Carrillo, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are adhered 
to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We use the ATS UPPG report, which is updated regularly with the parents preferred language for communications 
by grade and by class. In order to facilitate parental involvement and active participation to our school 
community, we canvas the language preference for communication with parents and guardians in several ways. 
At the time of the child's enrollment parents fill out the Language of Communication Preference Form which 
serves as a starting point for assessing translation and interpretation needs. We also gather data from ATS 
Language preference reports to assess the language of communication needs of the parents of the entire student 
population in our school, not only the ELLs. In addition, we screen the data from the Home Language 
Identification Survey, (HLIS) and interview with parent, the Bilingual Education Student Information Survey (BESIS) 
reports, and ATS bio reports to anticipate the needs of translation and interpretation services in different 
languages.

2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

Language  

Parents and students were 
interviewed as part of the 
orientation when first admitting 
their children to the school. The 
data show a large number of 
students who have reported 
Spanish as their home language. 
A review of the data gathered 
from ATS/UPPG indicates that 
currently the majority of parents 
prefer communication in English, 
but 371 parents of EBT students, 
ELLs included, prefer Spanish as 
the language of written and oral 
communication, The 
overwhelming majority of 
parents of our English Language 
Learners indicate a preference 
for written and oral 
communication in English.  

A small number of parents (the 
whole school, not just ELLs) 
expressed their preference for 
other languages as follows:  

13 Bengali, 4 Chinese, 3 Fulani, 1 
Haitian, 2 Arabic, 1 French, 1 
Urdu, 1 Tibetan, 1 Napali & 1 
Swahili. These findings were 
reported to our school leadership 
team, to the assistant principals, 
to the teachers, and to the 
parents at regularly scheduled 
meetings of each respective 
group. In addition, we conduct an 
informal survey of both students 
and parents on our school 
website (www.ebtbrooklyn.com).  

As common practice, all 
correspondence with the parents 
is sent home in English and 
Spanish. For the other languages 
we use staff members who speak 
the language to translate or the

relevant to ELLs include entitlement/non-
entitlement/continuation letters, Parent 
Program Placement Preference form & 
placement decision letters. These are all 
available translated to our parents' 
preferred languages on the DOE OELL 
website .  

In addition, EBT has identified staff 
members who are fluent in languages 
other than English. We are currently able 
to assist with the translation of documents 
to parents in the home language indicated 
on the Home Language Identification 
Survey (HLIS) and Bilingual Education 
Student Information Survey (BESIS) in 
Spanish, French, Arabic, Haitian and 
Bengali.

who have indicated Spanish as their home 
language.  

- We will also utilize translation materials 
made available by the Office of English 
Language Learners for languages other 
than Spanish, as indicated on the Home 
Language Identification Survey (HLIS) and 
Bilingual Education Student Information 
Survey (BESIS).  

- All students data, including grades 
comments, assignments , messages to 
students and parents sent by school staff 
through JUPITER GRADES are automatically 
translated and available to parents In 
Spanish  

   

 

2.  List the formal face-to-face meetings your school will typically have with parents throughout the school year, such as

conferences or curriculum nights, when they will occur, and plans to provide interpretation at those meetings.  
   

Meeting Name  

Month/Frequency of Meetings  

How does your school plan to 

provide interpretation service(s)?  

 

 

Typically, we require interpretation 
services for parent-teacher 
conferences, including disciplinary 
meetings, DOE parent nights (in 
November and during the Spring), and 
IEP meetings.  

Informal interactions anticipated 
include teacher, attendance teacher 
and/or guidance counselor calls to 
parents. These happen during the 
entire school year and are not 
possible to predict when they will 
occur.  

   

 

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.

Part C: Training Staff on Policies and Procedure

 
Describe how your school will ensure that all staff members are aware of the goal of Chancellor’s Regulation A-663 and 
what resources are available to meet compliance.  
 

 

 

 
 
Part D: Providing Notice of Language Assistance Services 
 
Describe how your school will make parents that cannot communicate in English aware of their right to receive 
information. Include any: 

  Translated signage 
  Brochures/flyers/letters shared with parents 
  Any parent engagement events where this is expressed (i.e. PTA meetings, international parent’s night, etc..) 

 

Parents who speak a language other than English have been provided with a copy of the Bill of Parents Rights and 
Responsibilities in the language indicated on the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS). In addition, these 
parents are provided with written notification of their rights regarding translation and interpretation services. A sign 
(in English, Spanish, Haitian Creole, Arabic and Chinese) indicating the office and room number where a copy of 
written notification of parental rights regarding translation and interpretations can be found will be posted in the 
main office of EBT. Furthermore, the school’s safety plan includes procedures for ensuring that parents in need of 
language assistance will be able to communicate with administrative offices. Lastly, parents will be notified of the 
Department of Education website which details their translation and interpretation rights and services.  
 

 
 
Part E: Monitoring Provision of Language Services 
Describe mechanisms your school will use to gather feedback from parents that cannot communicate in English on the 
language services they receive. How has your school implemented the feedback to improve language services?   
 

We use feedback from the Board of Education's parent survey to understand parent views about the quality and 
availability of services. In addition, we are considering scheduling a focus group of parents inclusive of all cultures and 
languages represented in our school to gather feedback and best practices.
