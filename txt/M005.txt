Section 3: Directions and Guidance for Developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan  

 

The Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) is meant as a tool to facilitate continuous improvement planning – to 
support schools in engaging their staff, parents, families, students, and community partners in assessing and prioritizing 
school needs, setting measurable improvement goals, selecting appropriate strategies to improve student outcomes, 
monitoring progress toward meeting annual goals, and communicating these efforts to the broader school community. 
This section will provide School Leadership Teams (SLTs) with guidance regarding CEP development aligned with the 
school’s state accountability and New York City’s Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools, 
Strong Schools, Strong Communities, and Framework for Great Schools. 

Equity and Excellence for All: Diversity in New York City Public Schools 

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to supporting learning environments that reflect 
the diversity of New York City. NYCDOE believes all students benefit from diverse and inclusive schools and classrooms 
where all students, families and school staff are supported and welcomed. This work is essential to our vision of Equity 
and Excellence for all NYC students. The research is clear – that all students benefit from diverse, inclusive schools and 
classrooms. The Equity and Excellence for All initiative is already improving the quality of our schools, making them more 
attractive to a broader range of students. Through comprehensive educational planning informed by Equity and 
Excellence for All, schools will continue to work to fulfill the promise of diversity in New York City Public Schools for our 
families and students. 

Strong Schools, Strong Communities  

The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) is committed to working collaboratively with parents, families, 
educators, and communities to improve student achievement and ensure that every child graduates from high school 
prepared for college, a career, and a future as a productive, critically-thinking adult.  

The Department is establishing programs to strengthen ties between schools and communities, and is giving teachers 
and students the support they need to reach higher standards. These programs and supports are building a system of 
schools centered on student learning. Along with strengthened partnerships between parents, teachers, students, 
school leaders, and communities, these initiatives will ensure Strong Schools, Strong Communities, so that 
all students succeed. Additional information is available in a report, entitled Strong Schools, Strong Communities: A New 
Approach to Supporting New York City’s Public Schools and All of Our Students.  

The Framework for Great Schools and CEP Development 

The Framework for Great Schools encourages parents, educators, school communities, and 
external stakeholders to work together to improve student achievement and increase 
learning opportunities. This collaborative focus will ensure that every child is consistently 
ready for the next grade, level, and set of challenges. The Comprehensive Educational Plan 
(CEP) will reflect this focus and should serve as the blueprint that engages a school 
community in a systematic, ongoing review and analysis of student needs to identify and 
address root causes and implement activities and strategies that improve outcomes for 
students. 
 

Based on robust research, the six elements of the Framework identify the areas that we must improve to accomplish 
high student achievement. By focusing attention and resources on what it takes for schools to function well, the 
Framework for Great Schools identifies the underlying strengths and weaknesses of a school and shows community 
members concrete ways to improve. 
 
In accordance with the requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655, all SLTs are to develop an educational plan in 
consultation with parents, school staff, and students, to provide a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders to 
participate in shared decision making and school improvement. The expectation is that SLTs will engage in a 
comprehensive educational planning process to inform the development of five goals and action plans that align with 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          7 

 
the first five elements of the Framework for Great Schools (listed below). The sixth element, Trust, is foundational to all 
the other elements. A goal that reflects a holistic approach will often address more than one element, as the elements 
work together to support student achievement. Place your goal in the section of the template where it fits best, knowing 
that it likely addresses other elements as well. 
 

The Six Elements of the Framework for Great Schools  

Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards 
are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical 
thinking skills. 
Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and school culture where students feel safe, supported, 
and challenged by their teachers and peers. 
Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success and improvement of their classrooms and schools. 
They have the opportunity to participate in professional development within a culture of respect and continuous 
improvement. 
Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, 
developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional support that drives student achievement. 
Strong Family-Community Ties: School leadership brings resources from the community into the school building by 
welcoming, encouraging, and developing partnerships with families, businesses, and community-based organizations. 
Trust: Everyone works toward the shared goal of improving student outcomes, preparing students for success in school 
and beyond. Across the school community, there is respect. School staff, parents, students and administrators value 
each other. 

 

The Quality Review and the Framework for Great Schools 

In order to address the six elements of the Framework for Great Schools, school communities should engage in 
improvement planning that is also informed by the NYCDOE’s Quality Review Indicators and other quantitative 
and qualitative data. 

NYCDOE’s Quality Review (QR) 

The Office of School Quality (OSQ) supports school improvement across the NYC Department of Education (DOE) by 
coordinating qualitative assessments of school communities. All of the qualitative assessments are rooted in the Quality 
Review rubric and drive improvements to school practice, with the ultimate goal of impacting student achievement. The 
Quality Review (QR) Rubric has ten indicators within three categories as outlined below:  

I.       Instructional Core Across Classrooms: Curriculum (1.1), Pedagogy (1.2), Assessment (2.2) 
II.    School Culture: Positive Learning Environment (1.4), High Expectations (3.4)  
III. Systems for Improvement: Leveraging Resources (1.3), Goals and Action Plans (3.1), Teacher Support and 

Supervision (4.1), Teacher Teams and Leadership Development (4.2), Monitoring and Revising Systems (5.1) 

  
School Quality Guide  

The School Quality Guide is an important part of the New York City Department of Education’s (NYC DOE’s) efforts to 
set expectations for schools and promote school improvement. The report is designed to assist educators to 
accelerate academic achievement toward the goal of career and college readiness for all students. The report is also 
available to families and other members of the community who wish to obtain detailed information about a school’s 
practices and performance. The School Quality Guide includes a mixture of qualitative and quantitative information. 
For the quantitative information, the report provides multiple years of data, which shed light on trends over time. 
The report also provides context for the school’s quantitative data by including comparisons to the performance of 
similar schools and all schools citywide. The report includes school-specific targets for each quantitative metric, set 
based on the historical performance of similar schools and all schools citywide. 

 

Title I Requirements and Strengthening Title I Parent Involvement 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          8 

 
Title I schools are subject to the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) requirements regarding school accountability, 
professional development, and parent and family engagement. 
 
To strengthen parent leadership in Title I schools, and increase the involvement of all parents of Title I eligible children in 
improving students’ academic outcomes, all Title I schools are required to establish a Title I Parent Committee that will 
serve as the consultative and representative body for all Title I parents in the school to provide voice into the 
administration and spending of Title I funds. Title I parents may choose to establish: 
 
 
 
It is recommended that the Title I Chairperson (or alternate representative) attends all regular meetings of the School 
Leadership Team (SLT). The SLT is responsible for facilitating consultation with the Title I parent committee regarding the 
joint development of the CEP, Parent and Family Engagement Policy, School Parent Compact (SPC) and the use of the 1% 
parent involvement set-aside in Title I schools. Title I parent must be consulted regarding the use of the Title I 1% 
budget. The Title I 1% set-aside is used to supplement parent and family activities as described in the school’s Parent 
and Family Policy and must be aligned with student achievement goals as outlined in the CEP. For additional guidance on 
establishing a Title I Parent Committee click here. 

a Title I parent subcommittee of the existing Parent Association (PA)/Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) or; 
a Title I Parent Advisory Council (PAC) 

 
Next Steps for CEP Development 

School Leadership Teams should engage in the following steps:  

  Step 1: Ensure that a fully formed and functional School Leadership Team (SLT) exists and meets all the 

requirements of Chancellor’s Regulations A-655. 

  Step 2: Conduct a comprehensive needs assessment informed by the school’s updated NYSED accountability 

status and most current quantitative and qualitative data. Prioritize areas of focus for this school year. 

  Step 3: Revisit your school’s current goals, modify existing goals, and/or strategically create new goals informed 

by the needs assessment and aligned with the Framework for Great Schools. Ensure the annual goals are 
SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Writing your goals as SMART will help you 
monitor progress against the qualitative or quantitative measures you’ve identified, and will help your school 
community know when you’ve reached your goal. 

  Step 4: Build consensus around strategies, activities, and programs to address students’ needs in each action 
plan. Create action plans that translate into observable, effective strategies to improve student achievement. 

  Step 5: Update your school’s AIS section and complete the Students in Temporary Housing section. Title I 

schools must also update the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC). 

  Step 6: Establish a process for engaging in progress monitoring throughout the school year as part of an overall 

cycle of continuous improvement planning to assess whether activities and strategies outlined in the action 
plans are resulting in improved student performance. Adjust practices, when necessary. 

Treat the plan as a living document. Adjust the plan along the way as your experiences and the evidence justify. Careful 
implementation of your ideas, follow-through, and continuous evidence-based monitoring of progress are the keys to 
accomplishing desired results. 

Section 4: CEP Overview 

 

1.  What is your school’s mission statement? 

The school vision states: P.S. 5 is a professional learning community where all of its members will achieve high 
standards and become life-long learners. Our mission states we are able to accomplish our vision by focusing on 
student performance and progress. Further, by strengthening the quality of teachers, widening partnerships between 
school staff, students, and the home and including members of the broader community we hold all accountable for 
the success of our students.

2.  Provide contextual information about your school’s community and its unique/important characteristics, 

including a description of strategic collaborations/partnerships and/or special initiatives being implemented.  

P.S. 5 -- The Ellen Lurie School was built on the premise of being a Full Service Community School. It is located in the 
Inwood Heights section of Manhattan off the Harlem River Drive that houses approximately 575 students in grades 
Pre-Kindergarten through grade five. The school is comprised of 6% Black, 2% of other ethnic backgrounds, and a 
significant Hispanic population of 92%. Teacher attendance is 95% and student attendance is 93%. The school receives 
Title I funding and is a universal school where all of its children receive free breakfast and lunch. P.S. 5 participates in 
School Food's "Breakfast in the Classroom" program where all children are offered a healthy breakfast during the first 
20 minutes of the day. 

Since its inception, P.S. 5 has had a collaborative partnership with Children’s Aid Society that includes quality 
health/medical, dental, mental health services, Head Start and Early Head Start programs. Additional programs 
include an after-school instructional and recreational program, as well as a host of support services including Holiday 
School, summer camp and a school based summer program. 

PS5 offers additional supports for students in the form of enrichment clusters, based on the research of Joseph 
Renzulli in gifted and talented education. Student self-select an enrichment cluster for a 12 week cycle. This activity 
takes place weekly for 90 minutes and a community celebration culminates in the students sharing what they have 
learned with their families and the entire school community. We also offer after school tutoring, a Title III program to 
strengthen students' acquisition of English, and an academic Saturday Academy. 

In an effort to meet the academic and social emotional needs of our students we have partnered with the following 
agencies: Children's Aid Society, Carmel Hill Foundation, Center of Arts Education, Literacy Inc., New York Restoration 
Project, Shen Wei Dance Arts, and Chess in the Schools. These organizations offer a wide-range of programs for our 
children starting with health and wellness, literacy, music, buddy reading and parent training, recreation and science 
in the garden. 

P.S. 5 is dedicated to providing a rich education for the whole child; a rigorous academic program coupled with 
enrichment activities, music, art and physical education in a nurturing and safe environment. Partnering with the 
Department of Education's Office of English Language Learners, we enthusiastically have added two dual language 
Kindergarten and two dual language Grade 1 classes to our successful transitional bilingual program. The goal of our 
program is to grow our students, both speakers and non-speakers of English, to be bi-literate in both English and 
Spanish to prepare them for opportunities that require fluency in two languages in the future. P.S. 5 is an exciting 
place to learn and we are excited about the many opportunities for success that we offer our students and families. 

 

3.  Describe any special student populations and what their specific needs are. 

The student body includes 41% English Language Learners (ELLs) and 22% Students with Special Needs as of October 
2018. 

In order to most effectively serve the varying proficiency levels of our ELLs, P.S. 5 offers several programs to families, 
including a Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE) Spanish program in Grades 2-5, a Dual Language program in 
Kindergarten and Grade 1, and English as a New Language (ENL) program throughout all grades. Our ELLs require 
additional scaffolds, front loading of vocabulary, and explicit teaching practices in order to most effectively gain 
access to the curriculum. In addition, structured opportunities for student to student talk and student writing provide 
our ELLs with a predictable framework in which to safely share their ideas and background knowledge. 

Our students with special needs are served in various ways, including in self-contained classes, integrated co-teaching 
classes on each grade, SETSS, and related services in speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical 
therapy, adaptive physical education, and hearing teacher services. Our students with special needs require a 
predictable classroom environment in which teachers explicitly model their expectations for the learning and tasks

which are tailored to provide each student the right amount of challenge and support in order to accelerate student 
progress. 

 

4. 

Identify the elements of the Framework for Great Schools in which your school made the most progress over 
the past year, and your key areas of focus for this school year. 

Areas of Celebration: 

1.4 Framework - Supportive Environment - Structures are in place to support students' social and emotional growth. 
Within the school community, professional development, family outreach, and student learning experiences are 
strategically aligned to support effective academic and personal behaviors. IMPACT: Each student is known well by at 
least one adult who helps personalize attendance and support social emotional learning and youth development 
through the recognizing, understanding, labeling, expressing and regulating emotions (RULER) approach. 

1.3 / 3.1 Framework - Effective School Leadership - PS 5 makes strategic organizational decisions to support the 
school's instructional goals and meet student learning needs, as evidenced by meaningful student work products. PS 5 
establishes a coherent vision of school improvement that is reflected in a short list of focused, data-based goals that 
are tracked for progress and are understood and supported by the entire school community. 

1.1 Framework - Rigorous Instruction - PS 5's curricula is aligned to the Common Core Learning Standards, integrates 
the instructional shifts and are planned and refined using student work and data. IMPACT: The alignment with the 
Common Core builds curricular coherence and provides access to a diversity of learners while promoting college and 
career readiness.  

1.2 Framework - Rigorous Instruction - Students engage in high levels of discussion and participation across the 
classrooms. Teaching practices are aligned to the curricula and reflect a belief that students learn best in a community 
that supports the gradual release of responsibility model. IMPACT: Students produce meaningful work products that 
reflect the workshop structure that is aligned to the Danielson Framework for Teaching. 

3.4 Framework - Strong Family and Community Ties. - School leaders and faculty set high expectations for students 
and communicate effectively providing multiple opportunities to be active partners in their child's education. Teacher 
teams and staff establish a culture for learning that consistently communicates high expectations for all students. 
IMPACT: School leaders provide training through Monday afternoon professional development sessions and have a 
system of accountability through walkthroughs and teacher observations. Staff offer ongoing and detailed feedback 
and supports that prepare students for their next level of education.  

4.2 Framework - Collaborative Teachers - Teacher teams consistently analyze assessment data and student work at 
grade level team meetings and distributed leadership structures are in place. IMPACT: The analysis of student data 
and work products by teacher teams results in improved teacher practice as evidenced in Advance ratings and 
progress in student achievement. Distributed leadership structures increase opportunities for teacher leadership with 
a voice in key decisions.  

Area of Focus: 

2.2 Framework - Rigorous Instruction - Continue to support teacher pedagogy in the following: 

(1) to use and create assessments, rubrics, and checklists and pre- and post-tests that are aligned to the curricula 

(2) to consistently reflect the use of ongoing checks for understanding and student self-assessments 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          11 

 

(3) to provide actionable feedback to students and consistently make effective adjustments to meet student learning 
needs. 

1.2 Framework - Rigorous Instruction - Continue to deepen school-wide expectations of pedagogical practices to 
ensure that: 

(1) Group work protocols include assigned roles to secure that all students are actively engaged at all times 

(2) Explicit mini-lessons include modeling that can serve as a guide for students as they practice independently 

(3) Language protocols, such as question prompts, language stems, and high utility words, are established and utilized 
consistently to foster academic language development. 

At P.S. 5, we are engaged in creating, analyzing, and responding to impactful formative assessments within the 
classroom in order to more effectively adjust and differentiate our instruction for students. We will refine our 
instruction to accommodate for these adjustments and differentiation within daily guided reading, writing 
conferences, and daily flexible math groups.  

P.S. 5 is a member of Teaching Matters’ Assessment Matters Community, which is networked group of schools 
collaborating towards the common aim of building schools with assessment-informed climates, by leveraging the 
work of teacher leaders and teacher teams.  

Additionally, due to the fact that nearly half of our student population are English Language Learners, we will continue 
our work toward providing our ELLs, students with special needs, and native English speakers in mixed multilingual 
classrooms opportunities to build up their academic language. Academic language is the type of language necessary 
to successful participate in, comprehend, and communicate in cognitively demanding and context-reduced, age 
appropriate activities. Academic language is the language of books (Himmele 2009). Teachers will develop additional 
teaching strategies based on Leasaux's Advanced Literacies: (1) Engaging Texts, (2) Rich Discussion, (3) Frequent 
Writing and (4) Academic Language and Vocabulary. 

Finally, in order to further the development of our students’ emotional intelligence, the school community is engaged 
in learning to develop emotionally responsive classroom practices, including the RULER Approach and behavioral 
supports from Life Space Crisis Intervention. 

The strides that the school has made over the last three years have allowed the school to be recognized by the state 
as a "School in Good Standing". Certainly these strides could not have happened without a faithful partnership 
between our administration, teachers, parents, Children's Aid Society and other community based programs as 
previously mentioned.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5A – Framework for Great Schools Element – Rigorous Instruction: Instruction is customized, inclusive, 
motivating, and aligned to the Common Core. High standards are set in every classroom. Students are actively engaged 
in ambitious intellectual activity and developing critical thinking skills. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

 
Strengths 

During the 2017-2018 school year P.S. 5 students increased their performance on the NYS ELA Test by 4 percentage 
points during the 2017-2018 school year, as compared to performance during the 2016-2017 school year. Last year 
25% of tested students performed on Levels 3 & 4, as compared to 21% the previous year. It should be noted that 
the percentage of student refusals on the NYS ELA test in 2018 dropped significantly as compared to 2017. In 2018, 
97.3% of third graders were tested, as compared to 75% in 2017. In 2018, 97.1% of fourth graders were tested, as 
compared to 81% in 2017. In 2018, 100% of fifth graders were tested, as compared to 93% in 2017.  

13.6% of our ELLs performed at Levels 3 & 4 in 2018, as compared to 6% in 2017. 11.3% of our SWDs performed at 
Levels 3 & 4 in 2018, as compared to 7% in 2017. Level 1 student performance decreased to 34% in 2018, as 
compared to 39.3% in 2017. Level 1 ELL performance decreased to 51.8% in 2018, as compared to 58% in 2017. Level 
1 SWD performance decreased to 60.3% in 2018, as compared to 66% in 2017. Students' average proficiency rating 
increased from 2.39 to 2.42 in 2018. The average proficiency rating of our ELLs increased from 2.28 to 2.31 in 2018.  

P.S. 5 students increased their performance on the NYS Math Test by 5 percentage points during the 2017-2018 
school year, as compared to performance during the 2016-2017 school year. Last year 30% of tested students 
performed on Levels 3 & 4, as compared to 25% the previous year. It should be noted that the percentage of 
student refusals on the NYS Math test in 2018 dropped significantly as compared to 2017. In 2018, 99.2% of third 
graders were tested, as compared to 86% in 2017. In 2018, 97.3% of fourth graders were tested, as compared to 86% 
in 2017. In 2018, 98.6% of fifth graders were tested, as compared to 88% in 2017. 

12.8% of our ELLs performed at Levels 3 & 4 in 2018, as compared to 11% in 2017. 11.5% of our SWDs performed at 
Levels 3 & 4 in 2018, as compared to 8% in 2017. Students' average proficiency rating decreased slightly from 2.52 to 
2.5 in 2018. The average proficiency rating of our ELLs increased from 2.39 to 2.42 in 2018. 

P.S. 5 students increased their performance on the NYS Science Test by over 14% during the 2017-2018 school year, 
as compared to performance during the 2016-2017 school year. Last year 72% of tested students performed on 
Levels 3 & 4, as compared to 57.39% the previous year. 51.5% of our ELLs performed at Levels 3 & 4 in 2018, as 
compared to 35.4% the previous year. 50% of our SWDs performed at Levels 3 & 4 in 2018, as compared to 38.8% the 
previous year. 

Teacher pedagogy, as measured by Advance and the Danielson Framework was strengthened as evidenced by an 
8% increase in teacher's Measure of Teacher Practice scores from 2016-2017 to 2017-2018. There was a 14% 
increase in teacher practice in 3c-Engaging students in Learning, a 13% increase in teacher practice in 1e-Designing 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          14 

 

Coherent Instruction, a 12% increase in teacher practice in 1a-Demonstrating Knowledge in Content and Pedagogy, an 
8% increase in teacher practice in 3d-Using Assessment in Instruction, and a 2% increase in teacher practice in 3b-
Using Questioning and Discussion Techniques. 

According to QR-1.1. Curriculum feedback from May 2018, CCLS alignment and coherence is apparent in unit design 
across the grades in all curricula areas. Lesson plans follow the belief in the gradual release of responsibility model 
and adjustments are made to curriculum based on data. According to QR-1.2 Pedagogy feedback from May 2018, the 
gradual release of responsibility is best demonstrated with a workshop model of instruction, which was found most 
noticeably in ELA and math lessons. The workshop model in writing provided opportunities for students to work in 
partnerships, small groups, and independently with teacher guidance and feedback. Student discussions are seen in 
most classes, with turn and talk sighted the most.  

Finally, according to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, P.S. 5 scored a 4.27 for the NYC School Survey Element, 
compared to 3.56 the previous year, a 0.71 increase. 

Priority Needs 

While an increase was observed in students' performance on the NYS ELA Test in Levels 3 & 4 in 2018, 34% of 
students are performing at Level 1 as of Spring 2018. This is a reduction of 5.3% when comparing results to Spring 
2017; however, this still must be addressed. When examining the June Instructional Reports, our students are 
struggling with being able to infer the central message and theme of their texts, as well as being able to integrate this 
information across two texts and explain their reasoning in writing. 

According to QR-2.2 Assessment feedback from May 2018, teachers use and create assessments, including rubrics, 
checklists, and interim assessments, in English, math, science, and social studies and continue to work on ensuring 
alignment with the school's curricula, as well as continuing to work on providing actionable feedback for students to 
guide their improvement. In addition, teachers are continuing to build their repertoire of consistent ongoing checks 
for understanding and student self-assessment.  

Last year, the Fundamentals of Writing program was in Year 2 of implementation school wide. Professional 
development was primarily focused on consistency within the gradual release of responsibility model of lesson 
delivery, as well as establishing the structure of writing conferences. QR, PPO visits, as well as Advance Observations 
from 2017-2018, indicated some inconsistent practices across classrooms within the Active Engagement portion of 
the lesson, as well as with providing students with actionable feedback. 

Continued support and development is needed to provide teachers with more targeted classroom support in 
designing Active Engagement opportunities that are clearly aligned to the teaching point of each lesson, as well as to 
assess and communicate actionable next steps to ensure for progress in performance of all of our students, but 
especially for our SWDs and ELLs. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element  of  the  Framework  for  Great  Schools–Rigorous  Instruction.  Your  goal  must  be  responsive  to  the  identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound.  
By June 2019, students in grades 4-5 will show progress in evidenced-based writing across the genres as evidenced by a 
40% decrease of students scoring Level 1 on the 2019 ELA State Assessments. The number of students scoring Level 1 
will be reduced from 47 students to 29 students.

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Rigorous Instruction and New York 
State standards in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and identify key personnel responsible 
for implementation and oversight. 
The school engages families by providing information to the community at large during PTA monthly meetings. 
Teachers invite parents during Parent Engagement Tuesdays to talk about their student, participate in workshops to 
help them understand the curriculum and teachers provide packets, websites and fun activities for parents to do with 
their children that support learning. The key personal responsible for this are the classroom teachers, administration 
and the guidance department to support our families. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          17 

 

In addition, families are invited to Open Classroom Visits every six weeks in which parents are given an overview of 
the lesson they will be observing, parents observe the lesson, and then have an opportunity to debrief the lesson with 
school staff.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 
Section 5B – Framework for Great Schools Element – Supportive Environment: The school establishes a classroom and 
school culture where students feel safe, supported, and challenged by their teachers and peers. 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

3.  What policies, practices, and structures are in place to ensure you are supporting the whole child? 
Strengths 

According to QR-1.4 Positive Environment feedback from May 2018, this is a well-developed, area of celebration for 
the school as evidenced by the following: 

  One of the structures in place to support each student's social and emotional learning is the school's 

commitment to the RULER Emotional Intelligence approach from Yale University. RULER stands for 
Recognizing emotions, Understanding Emotions, Labeling emotions, Expressing emotions, and Regulating 
emotions.  

  Another structure in place that supports each child being known well by at least one adult is the school's 

Schoolwide Enrichment Model (SEM). The school staff and community believe that students learn in varying 
ways and administer a 12-week cycle of STEAM-focused SEM model classes that teachers create, such as 
coding, movie making, science experiments, cooking, and poetry. 

  There is a strategic alignment among professional development, family outreach, and student learning 

experiences and supports.  

According to 2017-2018 Advance Teacher Observation ratings, the average teacher rating in 2a-Creating an 
Environment of Respect and Rapport was 3.49 out of 4.00, which was the same rating average from the previous year 
and the average teacher rating in 2d-Managing Student Behavior was 3.58 out of 4.00, a 12% increase from the 
previous year. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, P.S. 5 has a 95% positive rating for Safety, a 93% positive rating for 
Social-Emotional, and a 80% positive rating for Peer Support for Academic Work. 

Priority Needs 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, P.S. 5 has a 74% positive rating for Classroom Behavior. More 
specifically, teachers report the following: 

-65% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes behave well in class even when the teacher 
isn't looking (60% in 2017) 

-68% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes listen carefully when the teacher gives 
directions (73% in 2017). 

-75% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes pay attention when they are supposed to 
(71% in 2017). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          19 

 

-75% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes do their work when they are supposed to 
(78% in 2017). 

-83% of teachers responded that a lot or all of the students in their classes follow the rules in class (75% in 2017). 

When analyzing OORS Reports for 2017-2018, of 41 total incidence, 46% of all infractions took place within the 
classroom, while the next highest percentage of incidence was 24%, showing a need to continue to develop social 
emotional supports within classrooms. 

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate your school’s 2018-19 goal for improving student outcomes and school performance that addresses this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Supportive Environment. Your goal must be responsive to the 
identified priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, 
and Time-bound.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

Section 5C – Framework for Great Schools Element – Collaborative Teachers: Teachers are committed to the success 
and improvement of their classrooms and schools. They have the opportunity to participate in professional 
development within a culture of respect and continuous improvement. 

 

Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, P.S. 5 scored a 3.80 within the Collaborative Teachers School 
Survey Measure, which was 0.08 points above the District average and an increase of 0.22 from the previous year. 

According to QR-4.2 Teacher Teams and Leadership feedback from May 2018, the following strengths were reported: 

  Various teacher teams function for specific purposes. Vertical ELA and math assessment lead teachers' team 

receive ongoing training in facilitating teacher team meetings. They meet to participate in schoolwide 
decisions regarding curriculum based on assessments given and students' mastery of the standards and to 
turnkey information to grade level teams.  

  Teachers use protocols to examine student work in mathematics to decide whether students need 

remediation on a focus standard or to address a new standard through a new cycle of inquiry. Teacher teams 
discuss lesson/unit adjustments in order to provide differentiated instruction according to student needs. A 
newly-developed common assessment or one already available through the curriculum is administered to 
determine if teaching practices were effective in increasing students' progress. 

  Grade level teacher team collaborative planning meetings take place once a week. Coaches and/or assistant 

principals attend meetings and provide support to teachers. In addition, teacher teams have at least two 
additional common preps to meet during the week. Prior to implementing a unit, teachers review the CCLS 
addressed in the unit, as well as the expected outcomes of the unit, and consider the needs of students, 
including those of ELLs and SWDs. During the unit, teacher teams share student work, using a protocol to 
make adjustments to the unit, including scaffolds to provide multiple entry points for ELLs and students with 
disabilities. After completion of the unit, chapter tests and/or performance tasks are analyzed using a 
protocol. 

During 2017-2018, we have made gains in more frequently analyzing formative assessment data across classrooms, 
particularly in Math. Teachers have met together to analyze and adjust curricula based on pre- mid- and post-chapter 
assessments. Teachers have become more cognizant in not only identifying standards in need of reinforcement, but 
also prerequisite skills/standards that are necessary in order for students to secure the understanding of the standard 
being taught. Student grouping has been more flexible in classrooms, as well as across the grade due to the more 
frequent analysis of formative assessments. 

Vertical teacher teams are working, as well to align the Ready Gen units with the Social Studies curriculum where 
possible. Decisions will be made to align the CCLS that need to be taught in informational writing with the social 
studies and support it with either the Ready Gen units and or the Writing Fundamentals curriculum.

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          24 

 

We continue to work on PPO written feedback from 2016-2017, "refine the practice of incorporating standards based 
discussions into common planning periods to ensure that teachers are always working towards the standards when 
planning." 

Although there has been some progress in our formative assessment and standards-based data tracking, this 
continues to challenge our school community. We find that we have collected an extraordinary amount of data, but 
we struggle in being able to efficiently analyze and implement instruction shifts in a timely matter to address student 
needs in real-time. This lag in actionable data-driven steps negatively impacts the entire school community in tracking 
school-wide, grade-wide, teacher, and student goals.  

Teachers need greater time to work together to plan their units of study, increase the quality of their questions and 
discussion and collaboratively look at student work. With that in mind teachers agreed via the UFT SBO system to stay 
for 100 minutes on P.D. Monday. This will allow them to work more closely on their math units, discuss areas of 
weakness and strength and look strategically at student work to see where they need to chunk, re-teach or enrich the 
unit chapter for increased student understanding. Further the second grade teachers will continue sharing their work 
on "Math Talks". This differentiated approach to have children share how they arrived at solving a problem will be 
demonstrated to the other grades. 

When analyzing the June Instructional Reports for Math in Grades 3-5 NYS Test 2018, we noticed the need to focus on 
the following CCLS standards by grade as follows: 

Grade 3:  

Adding Area...13% in the Measurement and Data Domain 

Numbers as fractions...18% in the Number and Operations Fractions Domain 

Two Step Word Problems...25% Operations & Algebraic Thinking Domain 

 

Grade 4:  

Understand Angle Addition...19% in Measurement and Data Domain 

Multiplication Word Problems...26% in Operations and Algebraic Thinking 

Fraction Measurements...29% in Measurement and Data Domain 

 

Grade 5: 

Place Value...20% in Numbers and Operations in Base Ten Domain 

Convert Measurments...20% in Measurement and Data Domain 

Multiple Fraction Problems...21% in Numbers and Operations Fractions Domain

Part 2 – Annual Goal 

Indicate  your  school’s  2018-19  goal  for  improving  student  outcomes  and  school  performance  that  addresses  this 
element of the Framework for Great Schools–Collaborative Teachers. Your goal must be responsive to the identified 
priority need(s) indicated in Part 1, and be written as SMART–Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-
bound. 
By June 2019, students in grades 4-5 will show progress in Mathematics as indicated in a 40% decrease of students 
performing at level 1 on the 2019 State Assessments. The number of students performing at level 1 will decrease from 
65 to 39.

Part 3a – Action Plan 

Activities/Strategies: Detail below the activities and strategies 
your school will implement to achieve the identified goal for 
this Framework for Great Schools element, including: 

  Evidence-based instructional programs, professional 

 

development, and/or systems and structures needed to 
impact change. 
Strategies to address the needs of students with 
disabilities, English language learners, and other high-
need student subgroups (e.g., overage/under-credited, 
SIFE, STH). 

Class schedules in Grades K-5 are reconfigured to ensure two 
non-consecutive Math periods daily. The first period will focus on 
the Math mini-lesson, explicit teaching, and student practice. 
Teachers will conduct formative assessments of student 
understanding of the teaching point of the day and group 
students appropriately for work in the second period of Math. 
During the second math period, the teacher will work with small 
groups of students to re-teach, address prerequisite skills, or 
enrich students as needed. Students will work independently 
daily to solve real-world problems utilizing the skills and 
strategies covered in the first period of math and will alternately 
work in pairs or groups to discuss, defend, and revise their 
mathematical thinking. 

Set a master schedule enabling all teachers in a grade to plan 
collaboratively during the day at least once a week and for at 
least 45 minutes on P.D. Mondays. In addition, adjust the Master 
Schedule to allow a seventh prep period for grade teams to meet 
every other week. Teachers will engage in inquiry cycles tracking 
student mastery of Math CCLS standards based on formative 
assessment entry in iO Education and make adjustments to both 
Go Math, Eureka, Progress, Ready, and additional supplementary 
curricula to address student misconceptions.

for our special needs and ELLs students will be an 
additional support for all our students.  

In grade teams (Grades 2-5), teachers will collaboratively design 
assessments (quizzes) on a weekly basis that assess student 
mastery of the focus standard for the week and making 
instructional next steps based on student progress. Additionally, 
Go Math Chapter Tests and Performance Tasks will be adjusted 
based on focus standards covered within each month (i.e. three 
chapter tests may be combined into one). NYS Math Released 
questions will be added to unit assessments. 

In grades K and 1, Eureka Math will be adopted in order to 
deepen students' number sense and conceptual understanding 
of the standards earlier on in our students' education. Grade 
teams will collaboratively plan and discuss teacher resources 
provided through Eureka and professional development videos 
to have a visual representation of desired classroom practices. 
Teachers will explicitly teach mathematical academic vocabulary 
which will allow students to identify and understand concepts 
more deeply in math (CCLS Shift #3).

3b – Parent and Family Engagement 

How will your school engage parents/families and support their understanding of Collaborative Teachers and strategies 
to promote teacher-parent/family collaborations in order to support their children at home? Include the timeline and 
identify key personnel responsible for implementation and oversight. 
During Parent Engagement Tuesdays we will invite parents to come in to discuss the results of their child's 
achievement on the various data systems that we have in place such as our STAR Math and Reading assessments, I-
Ready diagnostic testing (math), progress toward standard mastery within the Mastery Connect tool, and F & P 
Running Records. Parents will then have an opportunity to inquire what they can do to support their child's 
achievement. Classroom teachers, log monitoring by administration and administration visiting classrooms on Parent 
Engagement Tuesday is one way to ensure fidelity.

Section 5: Needs Assessment, Annual Goals, and Action Plans 

 

Section 5D – Framework for Great Schools Element – Effective School Leadership: Principals lead by example and 
nurture the professional growth of teachers and staff, developing and delivering the instructional and social-emotional 
support that drives student achievement. 
 
Part 1 – Needs Assessment   

Briefly summarize your needs assessment by answering each question below using the most current summative and 
formative data trends relative to this Framework element. For example, data sources should include but are not 
limited to the Quality Review, NYSED School Report Card, NYC School Quality Guide, NYC School Survey, etc. 
Number responses accordingly. 
 
1.  What are the school’s strengths relative to this Framework element?  Indicate the data trends, source and year. 
2.  What is the priority need(s) that will be addressed in the goal and action plan for this Framework element? 

Indicate the data trends, source and year. 

Strengths 

According to QR-3.4 High Expectations feedback from May 2018, the following evidence was reported: 

  The school’s motto, Ancora Imparo, means I am still learning and is displayed all over the building and in 

publications. The principal’s "Week in Advance" newsletter is published on Sunday nights and lists upcoming 
events, including PD sessions for Monday afternoons, Family Engagement Time on Tuesdays, special events, 
and any due dates as well as thanks to teams and individuals who have helped out, led, or assisted on past 
occasions. The staff handbook is presented to teachers at the beginning of the school year with the feedback 
from the previous year’s Danielson Framework for Teaching overview that sets the tone for expectations for 
the new year. These expectations are made clear to the staff and include the ways in which they will hold 
each other accountable for meeting those expectations. School leaders visit classrooms informally and give 
feedback in a timely manner both verbally and in writing, which teachers have come to expect, according to 
the principal. Feedback given during informal visitations will be referred to in official observations. There is a 
database where observations and next steps are recorded. Follow-up visits with coaches are monitored to 
ensure that they take place and to review the types of supports teachers are receiving. In addition, school 
leaders have a mid-year check-in with each teacher to assess the teacher’s progress on meeting goals and 
student performance. 

  There are several systems for accountability to ensure that instruction is becoming coherent, teachers are 

building capacity, and expectations are being met. Professional Development sessions on Mondays are 
designed to reflect Advance reports and student achievement data. Differentiated PD groups established in 
September included pre-kindergarten, kindergarten through grade five, out-of-class educators, cluster 
teachers and paraprofessionals for training in STAR assessment administration, new teachers for STAR 
orientation, and another group of paraprofessionals to learn more about documentation and student 
attendance procedures. The groupings change week to week to allow vertical and horizontal teams to train 
together. Every week has a new or deeper level of content and pedagogical learning in writing, math, or 
assessment. In addition, learning walks on specific topics are taken by school leaders, with feedback given to 
teachers that include glows and grows for that targeted group. Topics include writing mini-lessons and 
interactive read alouds. Grade level teams are visited at the same time and with same topic, so the feedback 
can then be discussed at grade level team meetings for further exploration and next steps. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide-NYC School Survey, P.S. 5 scored 4.34 points within the Effective 
School Leadership Framework Element. This is an increase of 0.37 points compared to 2016-2017. P.S. 5 out 
performed the District average by 0.62 points and the City average by 0.74 points.

As a school community we have worked towards creating a school community and culture that leads to success, well-
being and high expectations for all students by creating systems that are continuous and sustainable. There are 
common assessments and checks for understanding in all classrooms. Curricula aligned assessment practices and 
grading policies provided actionable feedback. Students hold up fingers/cards/colors to show an understanding of the 
targeted lesson. Teacher frequently ask students "who is having trouble" in order to support a student or students 
who are having difficulty. Teachers access and analyze students’ progress through benchmark assessments, formative 
and summative assessments. The school has a unified method to problem solving in math using the CUBES approach 
to break down a math problem. Students are aware of their reading levels and set goals to ensure continue progress. 

Student work is assessed using a common, grade specific rubric. There is continued refinement of assessment and 
feedback systems to ensure that students and families have a clear understanding of what their child is doing well and 
what they need to work on. Grade and vertical teams look at assessments to align them with Common Core Learning 
Standards and curriculum aligned rubrics to discuss next steps, as evidenced by team discussions and past agendas. 
Administration provides teachers with planning and discussion time. During the 2017-18 school year teachers 
engaged in discussions surrounding their lesson planning; it's successes, struggles, and best practices to support each 
other in improving instruction to students and at the same time their own practice. Teachers were provided with 
continuing to devleop our writing curriculum at their request as well as accompanying professional development. 
Budgetary considerations were made to be a member of the Assessment Matters community in order to support the 
school's instructional focus. Per session was available for planning, after school tutoring and Saturday Academy, as 
well as planning units of study in Science and extra support for our 4th grade students to prepare for the rigors of the 
New York State Science test. 

Administration will continue to provide targeted and timely feedback in formal and informal observations so that 
teachers can feel supported and successful. Coaches will be mentoring those colleagues that are having difficulty 
thereby creating a culture of caring and support and per session activities will continue in support of student and 
teacher learning. 

Priority Needs 

According to 2017-2018 PPO written feedback, enlist the support of assistant principals and instructional coaches to 
monitor instructional practices to ensure coherence across all classrooms. Secure that daily instruction includes 
consistent practices around monitoring student learning, including but not limited to, checks for understanding, exit 
tickets and conferring. 

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, the area within Effective School Leadership that scored the lowest 
was Teacher Influence at 83% positive (it was 81% positive in 2016-2017), which while still above the District and City 
averages at +3% and +5% respectively, is an area within this framework area that should take priority.  

 

 
Part 2 – Annual Goal

P.S. 5 scored 96% positive in the area of Outreach to Parents on the 17-18 School Quality Guide, which was 1% above 
the District average and a 1% increase from the previous school year. 

QR-3.4 High Expectations was rated Proficient in May 2018. Feedback from the QR included the following: 

  There is a strategic alignment among professional development, family outreach, and student learning 

experiences and supports. As an example, the social and emotional programming focused on students has a 
professional development component in the area of Emotionally Responsive Practice, with topics such as 
Respect for All-Bullying Module and Emotional Response-RULER. Parents were offered workshops through 
the Parents and Teachers Association (PTA) on academic and emotional support for their children. In 
addition to these, academic support workshops for parents include topics such as the Middle School 
Application process, a Dual Language Program at PS 5, What Parents need to know about NYS Math test, and 
a Literacy partnership. 

As a school community we have worked towards developing and increasing parental involvement to ensure our 
families are welcomed, informed, engaged and empowered. As partners in education families are active participants 
in their child’s education. 

The school has established a safe, nurturing environment that promotes the academic and social development of 
students and adults by informing families by sending home monthly calendars, quarterly newsletters announcing 
events and providing information regarding key dates. Parents have the opportunity to meet with teachers on Parent 
Engagement Tuesdays. In collaboration with CAS, parents are engaged in discussions on college and career readiness , 
ENL classes, Yoga and arts and crafts, so that they are motivated to support their child, given support to manage a 
new language and hopefully to think about the road to higher education. As a result, parents believe that they are 
better equipped to support the school’s effort as confirmed by parent interviews. 

The school leaders and the school leadership team, which includes staff, parents, and community partners, have 
developed an environment that provides reciprocal communication between families and the school that ensures that 
student needs are identified and supported.

According to the 2017-2018 School Quality Guide, P.S. 5 score 89%88% positive with the Parent Involvement in School 
component, which was a 1% increase compared to the previous school year, but 2% below the District Average and 
1% below the City average. When desegregating the data further, parents score the following statement significantly 
lower than others: 65% of parents/guardians responded that, since the beginning of the school year, they have been 
asked or had the opportunity to volunteer time to support their school sometimes or often. 

Greater parent participation is needed. To that end, in addition to the DOE scheduled parent/teacher conferences, 
parents will receive 3 additional school created progress reports. These reports will be in the form of STAR assessment 
results in ELA and I-Ready reports to inform parents of their child's progress. Further teachers will continue to be 
expected to log their communications with parents on Parent Engagement Tuesdays. It is our expectation that our 
efforts to make parents understand that a partnership between the school, the teacher, parent and child needs to be 
strong in order for their student to be successful. 

Parents of students in our kindergarten and Grade 1 dual language program will be invited to workshops about the 
curriculum and how to support learning in two languages. Topics such as organization, handling homework, and any 
other issue that might arise that we have not foreseen can be added as a workshop to insure our parents are 
confident partners with us in this new program.

also provides a built-in

2a. Highly Qualified Teachers (HQT) 

Describe the strategies and activities including strategies for recruitment, retention, assignments, and support 
including high quality professional development that ensures staff is highly qualified. 
Retention of staff has been stable as most teachers remain at PS5. Over time teachers develop relationships 
throughout the years as they have made the school a part of their career plan. Teachers develop a bond based on 
their rapport with each other and now have become a part of the recruitment process.  

Once teachers leave due to relocation, retirement or personal reasons, recruitment is through word of mouth, 
colleague recommendation, excessed teachers looking for a position, administrator referral, Teach For America, 
Teaching Fellows or open market. A hiring committee reviews resumes, interviews candidates, and views candidates' 
model lessons to determine if the candidates are highly qualified before making a recommendation to offer a 
position. If hired, the new teacher is paired with a mentor and also interacts regularly with the literacy and math 
coaches, as well as with colleagues serving as informal mentors on the grade or within the new teacher's license area. 

Seasoned teachers who are willing to share their craft often are mentors to new teachers during the year. They also 
become grade leaders as they are respected amongst their colleagues, attend workshops where they turn key 
information ensuring everyone is informed. Teacher provide each other with best practices during common planning 
periods or at other times when teachers are not obliged to meet but just due because of their commitment to their 
craft and to our students. Coaches provide additional support and build relationships with teachers creating a 
collaborative environment.  

Additionally, when searching for partner teachers in ICT classes we ask for volunteer teams who are willing to work 
together and if none are available, we have the partner teacher as an active participant in the search and interview 
process. This enables both teachers the opportunity to gauge themselves as to whether they will be a viable working 
team. It also affords the new teacher an opportunity to meet their collaborating teacher. This has successfully worked 
in both volunteer system and being a part of the selection process.  

Yearly, teachers complete a preference sheet with their choices. All effort is made to comply with teacher request 
taking into consideration, license, grade, seniority and school priority. 

 

 
2b. High Quality and Ongoing Professional Development 

Describe the activities and strategies for high quality professional development for teachers, principals, 
paraprofessionals, and staff that enable all students to meet Common Core State Standards (CCSS).  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          48 

 

Teachers participate in collaborative planning sessions with their colleagues to share and plan content strategies that 
build both teacher and student skills. This enables teachers to increase their knowledge base in developing, planning 
and preparation of units of study. These collaborative planning sessions allow the teachers opportunities to share 
their expertise with colleagues. This also allows the teachers flexibility in developing activities and tasks to address the 
needs of all of their students. All teachers participate in Professional Development activities (Common Core Learning 
Standards (CCLS) by grade; analysis of literacy and math CCLS in NYS Education assessments, etc.) providing them with 
opportunities to develop and sharpen their pedagogical skills. Additionally, grade teams meet to review and assess 
student work products as measured by grade standards and plan for next steps through the inquiry process. Teachers 
look at class and grade trends and plan accordingly. 

New teachers are provided with a mentor to help facilitate their learning process and make improvements in their 
craft of teaching. The mentor shares information, resources and suggestions in the teaching and learning process with 
their mentee. The mentor meets a minimum of two times a week to work with the new staff member with planning, 
data inquiry process, content instruction, behavior management, common core standards, and writing of units/lesson 
planning. New teachers work collaboratively with the mentor to enable themselves to engage students in the learning 
process and to critically challenge their thinking skills. Additionally, new teachers work together in grade teams in 
order to plan units and generate ideas, activities and plans during common planning time. 

The professional development that is offered is guided by the teacher P.D. team as per a survey which is filled out 
every September. Other opportunities are provided as per teacher need as deemed necessary by Administration such 
as the new learning in Balanced Literacy, our ENL professional meetings and Math Talks in grade 2, Fundations 
training and new this year for all staff data analysis by the Teaching Matters consultants. 

Paraprofessionals also receive professional development opportunities throughout the school year. At times, the 
professional learning is para specific; however, we try as often as possible to have our paras learn side-by-side with 
our teachers, as they are assisting teachers and supporting students in the classroom on a daily basis toward meeting 
the CCLS.  

Additional staff members, including related service providers and school aides participate in professional learning 
depending on their needs and the students they support. 

School leaders also participate in professional learning through bi-monthly District-wide Principal and Assistant 
Principal professional development. In addition, school leaders belong to Learning Pods of other Principals and 
Assistant Principals in which pod members visit one another's schools with a "problem of practice" purpose. School 
leaders also attend Chancellor's Conferences, as well as the annual CSA and AAP conferences.

Part 4: SWP Schools Only 

4a. Transition Plans to Assist Preschool Children (Elementary Schools Only)  

Describe the transition plans used to assist preschool children from early childhood programs to the elementary 
school program (e.g. aligned curriculum, joint PD & parent involvement activities, sharing of records/info, early 
intervention services, etc.). 
As Children’s Aid Society (CAS) partners with the school we have CAS Headstart and Early Headstart Programs 
providing services to children from 0-4. Early intervention is provided if the assessments reveal the necessity for these 
services. When students are ready to articulate to Kindergarten, the Headstart students and parents visit the 
Kindergarten classes to see instruction, meet teachers and discussion strategies for transition. Registration is also 
done in house enabling parents the comfort of having someone assist them in the process. School leaders and 
teachers meet with CAS staff to articulate about the strengths and needs of students matriculating to Kindergarten. 

Additionally, the same process will be adopted for our three new Pre-K classes providing transition to both students 
and parent/families. Families will visit classrooms, review curriculum, observe instruction and meet with Kindergarten 
social worker for any concerns. The IEP teacher will be available to families to visit ICT or Self-contained classes that 
provide the services as per program description for children with IEPs, related services and all will provide a sense of 
comfort and reassurance their child will receive what they need. Administrators are also present to support families 
based on their needs and concerns. Pre-K families will follow the required DOE Kindergarten registration process. 

Curricula is aligned to Quality Standards for PreK and both DOE PreK and CAS Headstart staff are supported by an 
Early Childhood consultant provided by the Department of Early Childhood, as well as a social worker. 

 

 
4b. Measures to Include Teachers in Decisions Regarding Assessments 

Describe the decision making process that teachers participate in regarding the use and selection of appropriate 
multiple assessment measures and the professional development provided regarding the use of assessment results to 
improve instruction.    
The MOSL team works together to identify the needed assessments for students that are required to determine 
teacher performance and rating. Throughout the year grades meet to identify the assessments of choice, on-going 
assessments, formal and informal. 

During the end of the previous school year and during beginning of the school year teachers discuss the value of 
certain assessments that have been used, their purpose, flexibility and information they provide. This year since we 
are part of the MOSL process all teachers were represented by a team of personnel that were informed and 
participated in the selection process of how teachers would be evaluated based on the assessments that are provided 
to students. At a Faculty Conference information and decisions are shared.  

Classroom teachers use a variety of assessments to gauge student learning and periodic assessments used at the 
beginning, middle and end of year to see if students have made appropriate growth. Baseline data is used as a starting 
point showing any loss of learning during the summer as compared to the articulation cards used for promotion in 
June. 

The teacher team structure allows teachers to use these results to reassess their instruction and content pedagogy. 

With our Literacy curriculum, Ready Gen and our math curriculum, GO Math, multiple assessments are being used 
throughout the year. Each unit will identify if students have made growth. Teachers have been trained in the teaching 
of tasks in order to have students respond to performance tasks.  

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          50 

 

Both Literacy and Math Coaches provide professional development support to teachers with the use of multiple 
assessments. Analysis of data is reviewed and trends are identified by class and grade. This helps the teachers identify 
student needs, reteach, assess again. 

School leaders collaborate to assess school level data trends and plan appropriate responses for teacher 
development, PD and staff assignments. 

 

 
4c. “Conceptual” Consolidation of Funds in SWP Schools 

Directions: All Schoolwide Program (SWP) schools in NYC are conceptually consolidating their Federal, State, and 
Local funds, even though the Galaxy system reports the allocations in separate accounting codes1. To be eligible 
for the flexibility consolidation of Federal funds, a Schoolwide Program school must identify in its Schoolwide 
plan (CEP) which programs are included in its consolidation and the amount each program contributes to the 
consolidated Schoolwide pool. Additionally, the school plan must document that it has met the intent and 
purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated2. On the chart below, indicate which Federal, State, 
and/or local Tax Levy program funds that are consolidated in your school’s Schoolwide Program, the amount 
each program contributes to the consolidated Schoolwide pool, and verification that the school has met the 
intent and purposes of each program whose funds are consolidated.

1Explanation/Background: 
Title I Schoolwide Program schools are expected to use the flexibility available to them to integrate services and 
programs with the aim of enhancing the entire educational program and helping all students reach proficient and 
advanced levels of achievement. In addition to coordinating and integrating services, Schoolwide Program schools 
may combine most Federal, State and local funds to provide those services. By consolidating funds from Federal, 
State, and local sources, a Schoolwide Program school can address its needs using all its available resources. This 
gives a school more flexibility in how it uses available resources to meet the identified needs of all its students.   
 
Consolidating funds in a Schoolwide Program means that a school treats the funds it is consolidating like they are a 
single “pool” of funds. In other words, the funds from the contributing programs in the school lose their individual 
identity and the school has one flexible pool of funds. The school uses funds from this consolidated Schoolwide pool 
to support any activity of the Schoolwide Program without regard to which program contributed the specific funds 
used for a particular activity – so long as the use of funds meets the intent and purposes of the programs from 
which the funds originate. To consolidate funding in a Schoolwide Program, the school does not literally need to 
combine funds in a single account or pool with its own accounting code. Rather, the word “pool” is used 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          51 

 
conceptually to convey that a Schoolwide Program school has the use of all consolidated funds available to it for the 
dedicated function of operating a Schoolwide Program without regard to the identity of those funds.  
 
Consolidating Federal funds in a Schoolwide Program has the following additional advantages: 

  Consolidating Federal funds eases the requirements for accounting for funds from each specific program 

separately, because a Schoolwide school is not required to distinguish among funds received from different 
sources when accounting for their use. 

  A school that consolidates Federal funds in its Schoolwide Program is not required to meet most of the 

statutory and regulatory requirements of the specific Federal programs included in the consolidation (e.g., 
semi-annual time and effort reporting for Title I). However, the school must ensure that it meets the intent 
and purposes of the Federal programs included in the consolidation so that the needs of the intended 
beneficiaries are met. 

 
2The intent and purposes of the Federal programs indicated on the chart above (Part 4c of this section) are as 
follows: 

  Title I, Part A – Schoolwide Programs: To upgrade the entire educational program in the school in order to 
improve the academic achievement of all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students. This includes 
provision of services for Students in Temporary Housing (STH). 

  Title I Priority and Focus School Improvement Funding: Support implementation of school improvement 

plans that aims to  improve instruction and address the identified needs  

  Title II, Part A: Supplementary funding to improve student academic achievement by reducing class size in 

grades K, 1, 2, and 3, with an emphasis on grades with an average register greater than 20. If space is not 
available to form additional classes, funds may support push-in teacher(s) to supplement the instructional 
program. 

  Title III, Part A: To help ensure that children with limited English proficiency become proficient in English, 
develop high academic attainment in English, and meet the same challenging State academic content and 
achievement standards in the core academic subjects that all other children are expected to meet. Another 
purpose of this program is to increase the capacity of schools to establish, implement and sustain high-
quality language instruction programs and English language development programs that assist schools in 
effectively teaching students with limited English proficiency. Title III, Part A is also designed to promote the 
participation of parents and communities of limited English proficient children in English language 
instruction programs. 

  Title III Immigrant:  Supplementary and enhanced services to LEP/ELL immigrant students, in the areas of 

English language acquisition and content area achievement. 

 
Important Note: The following funds may not be consolidated: 

  Title I Parent Involvement Set-aside: Title I, Part A funds must support parent involvement activities and 
programs. Chancellor’s Regulation A-655 requires School Leadership Teams to consult with Title I parent 
representatives regarding the Title I program and the use of these funds. Parent involvement activities 
funded through Title I must be included in the Parent and Family Engagement Policy and aligned with 
student achievement goals in the school comprehensive educational plan. 
IDEA: To ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education 
designed to meet their individual needs. 

 

  Grant funds awarded via a competitive process: These funds must be used for the purposes specified by 

the Grantor, as described in the school’s approved grant application.

Section 9: Parent and Family Engagement Policy and School-Parent Compact (SPC)  

 (Required for All Title I Schools) 

 

Directions: Title I schools are required to establish a Title I parent committee that will serve as the consultative and 
representative body for all Title I parents in the school regarding the Title I program. The Title I parent committee will 
participate with the School Leadership Team (SLT) in the joint review, planning, and improvement of the school’s Title I 
program. All Title I schools are required to have a Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson 
that develops a Parent and Family Engagement Policy in collaboration with the School Leadership Team that meets the 
parental involvement requirements of Title I. The Parent and Family Engagement Policy should describe how your school 
will plan and implement effective parent involvement activities and/or strategies to improve student academic 
achievement and school performance. The School-Parent Compact (SPC) is a component of the Parent and Family 
Engagement Policy that outlines how parents, the entire school staff, and students will share this responsibility. 
 
The activities and/or strategies included in your school’s Parent and Family Engagement Policy should align with current 
S/CEP goals for improving student achievement. Schools are encouraged to include feedback from the Parent 
Coordinator when updating the policy. In addition, if the school community will be engaged this year in central parent 
involvement initiatives, such as Parent Academy, which will provide training for school communities to help strengthen 
family-school partnerships, please be sure to include these activities in the school’s policy.  
 
Your school’s Title I Parent Representative or Parent Advisory Council Chairperson is encouraged to use the sample 
Parent and Family Engagement and SPC templates below (which meet federal Title I parental involvement requirements) 
as guidance for updating the school’s current policy. 
 
 

PS5 Parent Involvement Policy (PIP)  

Parent and Family Engagement Policy 

At PS 5, The Ellen Lurie School’s the Parent Involvement Policy was designed based upon a careful assessment of the 
needs of all parents/guardians, including parents/guardians of English Language Learners and students with 
disabilities. Our school community will conduct an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of this parent 
involvement policy with Title I parents to improve the academic quality of our school. The findings of the evaluation 
through school surveys and feedback forms will be used to design strategies to more effectively meet the needs of 
parents, and enhance the school’s Title I program. This information will be maintained by the school. In developing 
the Title I Parent Involvement Policy, parents of Title I participating students, parent members of the school’s Parent-
Teacher Association, as well as parent members of the School Leadership Team, were consulted on the proposed Title 
I Parent Involvement Policy and asked to survey their members for additional input.  

 

To increase and improve parent involvement and school quality, our school will: 

Support for Parents and Family Members of Title I Students 

● actively involve and engage parents in the planning, review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the school’s Title I 
program as outlined in the Comprehensive Educational Plan, including the implementation of the school’s Title I 
Parent Involvement Policy and School-Parent Compact; 

● engage parents in discussion and decisions regarding the required Title I set-aside funds, which are allocated 
directly to schools to promote parent involvement, including family literacy and parenting skills; 

● ensure that the Title I funds allocated for parent involvement are utilized to implement activities and strategies as

● encourage my child to follow school rules and regulations and discuss this Compact with my child; 

● volunteer in my child’s school or assist from my home as time permits; 

● participate, as appropriate, in the decisions relating to my child’s education; 

● communicate with my child’s teacher about educational needs and stay informed about their education by 
prompting reading and responding to all notices received from the school or district;

● Provide homework tools (crayons, pencil, pen, paper, glue, scissors) 

2. Hold parent-teacher conferences (four conferences annually in elementary schools) during which this compact will 
be discussed as it relates to the individual child’s achievement. Parent teacher conferences are held two times a year: 
the first conference for the year will be held on November and the second conference will be held in March. The 
parents are given the opportunity to attend one of two sessions 12:20pm - 2:20pm and 4:30pm - 7:00 pm. The notices 
are sent home notifying them of the conferences. An electron phone messaging system calls all student homes 
informing them of conference 

3. Provide parents with frequent reports on their children’s progress. P.S. 5 practice an open door policy. We have 
parent Family Night where parents meet with teachers during the first month of school. This provides an opportunity 
for the parents/families to meet each other where expectations for the year are discussed.  

4. We take into account that some parents/families may not understand English; therefore, P.S. 5 provides translators 
as needed and requested. As the year progresses, teachers make phone calls and send written reports on a regular 
basis to maintain a school-home communication. These notes are to be signed by the parent/guardian. This process 
ensures that a parent/guardian has read it and is in agreement or needs clarification from the teacher. Aside from the 
teacher’s effort to maintain a connection with the home, there are also monthly P.T.A meetings and bi-monthly 
parent workshops. P.S 5 has Open School week twice during the school year. During this week, the parents are 
allowed to visit their children’s classroom and observe the learning process that is taking place. Additionally, the 
Family Room, Room 110, is used for families to meet and discuss educational practices that are taking place in the 
school as well as workshops for them. 

HOME/SCHOOL COMPACT 

The school, Children’s Aid Society, and families of Public School Five recognize that while all parties agree that the 
expectations listed here are necessary in order to strengthen the communication and commitment between the 
home and the school, rare occasions may arise where one or all parties will have difficulty fulfilling all or part of this 
compact. It is also recognized that the school’s purpose is to support the community and its families in whatever 
manner is necessary and reasonable in its ability to do so, and likewise, it is the family’s responsibility to support the 
child and the school community. 

THE HOME 

PARENTS/GUARDIANS AT PUBLIC SCHOOL FIVE will volunteer at least six hours a year to the school in the form of 
parent 

workshops, PTA meetings, and or volunteering to assist in the lunchroom or library, with entry or dismissal, or 
working in the classroom with specific students. 

● PARENTS/GUARDIANS AT PUBLIC SCHOOL FIVE will send their children to school appropriately dressed, prepared to 
learn, and on time. 

● PARENTS/GUARDIANS AT PUBLIC SCHOOL FIVE will read to their children at least 30 minutes a night, or see that 
their child reads to him/herself 30 minutes each night. 

● PARENTS/GUARDIANS AT PUBLIC SCHOOL FIVE will attend both parent/teacher conferences during the school year 
to discuss the academic progress of their children. 

● PARENTS/GUARDIANS AT PUBLIC SCHOOL FIVE will assist their children with their homework assignments on a 
regular basis to ensure completion and accuracy. If language is an issue, the parent will see that all homework is done 
and will have the student explain what was done to them. Every homework assignment should be signed. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          59 

 

● PARENTS/GUARDIANS AT PUBLIC SCHOOL FIVE will see that when a child is absent that the child obtains his work 
and returns to school with a signed note from the doctor indicating the number of days the child had to miss school. 
Attendance at school will be a primary responsibility of the parent/guardian. 

● PARENTS/GUARDIANS AT PUBLIC SCHOOL FIVE will see that all notices and homework sent home are signed and 

returned to school promptly in order to ensure appropriate communication between the school and the home.

READING AT HOME HOW? WHEN AND HOW LONG? WHY? 

● Read with your child in your home language  

● Nightly Fosters a love, and passion for reading 

● 30 minutes of reading develop fluent readers  

● Tell Stories. 

● Establishes the habit of reading  Let your child have undisturbed reading time. 

WHERE TO GET BOOKS!  

● Let your child see you read for yourself 

● NYC Public Library on Broadway and Academy Street  Read a variety of materials. 

● P.S. Five School Library  

● Classroom Library 

It has been proven that successful readers come from homes where the adults demonstrate their love of books and 
encourage reading. None of us are too old to enjoy the experience of listening to another individual. Offer your 
interpretation of a new or well-loved story. 

To support this effort, we have instituted the Public School Five Reading Incentive project, READ! READ! READ! Please 
see that your child reads as many books as possible and writes a short report about the book. In this way, we can

2. 
3. 
4. 
High quality professional development that is “of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact on 
the teachers’ performance in classrooms.”  
1. 

Professional development activities should be well-planned, ongoing events rather than one-day or short-term 
workshops and conferences.  

Parent engagement and supports must ensure that there are appropriate translation and interpretation services to meet 
community needs.

Rationale:Integrating the arts with Social Studies can have profound impact on student 
outcomes. Research, shows that this approach to English Language Learning goes beyond 
improving engagement and retention to develop strategic and extended thinking. This after 
school program will incorporate innovative practices that support arts integrated learning 
experiences including phonics and word recognition, identification of key ideas and details, craft 
and structure, integration of their own and others’ knowledge and ideas; ability to draw, dictate 
and write to compose opinion and explanatory text and to participate in group discussion – all in 
the service of the development of creative classrooms that support arts, language literacy 
development and the understanding of the Social Studies content. 
Core Learning Skills The after school program will support the following core learning skills for 
students participating in the program: 
• Achievement of CCLS English Language Arts Reading Standards for literature/ informational 
text, foundational skills, and speaking, writing and listening. 
• Acquisition of social and academic language skills that are age appropriate and essential to 
students’ growth as young learners and members of their community 
• Increased mastery of levels two and three vocabulary (academic and discipline-specific words 
and concepts) 
• Increased artistic literacy (evidence of creating, performing, responding and connecting) 
• Increased creative capacities (evidence of imagination, investigation, construction and 
reflection) 
Classroom educators and teaching artists collaborate on devising and facilitating units of study 
that challenge students to construct increasingly complex understanding across disciplines. 
Scaffolded lessons involve creative work in a specific artistic discipline and related speaking, 
listening and writing tasks. Content is presented in a variety of formats, including texts, images, 
diagrams audio and video clips. New words and concepts are documented on large sheets of 
paper and revisited through the duration of the study, so that the class as a whole can build out 
from Tier I vocabulary to acquire and apply more complex understanding associated with 
academic studies. Artistic production also is documented throughout, so that students and 
teachers can routinely reflect on individual as well as collective progress. Each unit of study 
culminates in an exhibition, performance or portfolio review designed to help students 
demonstrate and articulate the learning achieved. 
Additionally, all participating ELLs will be involved in project based learning as they research, 
read, write, listen, have oral discussions about a particular Social Studies topic, and represent 
their learning through an art project.  
Students in 2nd grade will study New York City Over Time, 1600's, 1700's, 1800's and 1900's. 
For example, they will focus on; cause and effect relationships help us recount events and 
understand historical development. (Soc. St Standard 1). Native Americans inhabited NYC in the 
1600's and Famous explorers arrival in NYC. As per the 17-18 NYSESLAT results there are 18 
Expanding, and 17 Transitioning ELLs in 2nd grade. materials will be available as per their 
language proficiency level.  
3rd grade ELLs will focus on the case study of the country of Nigeria. As they are learning, they 
will answer the following essential questions: How do culture, geography and history shape a

community? How are world communities the same? How are they different?  As per 17-18 
NYSESLAT results there are 11 Transitioning and 6, 3rd grade students who scored Expanding. 
4th grade ELLs  will conduct a case study of immigration/migration in NYC. Major Focus: 
Immigration and Migration from the Early 1800's to the Present: many people have immigrated 
and migrated to NYS contributing to its cultural growth and development. (Soc St standards 
1,3,4,5)  Some of the sub-topics are as followed: 
The Melting Pot vs. The Salad Bowl metaphor. 
Contributions of immigrants (culture,recreation, food, language, labor, skills).  
African-American Migration. 
As per the 17-18 NYSESLAT results 5 students scored Transitioning, and 15 scored Expanding 
in the 4th grade.   
5th grade ELLs, will conduct a case study about the country of Canada, with a focus on culture, 
geography, government and economics.  Essential Question; How do key forces and events 
shape nations? As per the 17-18 NYSESLAT there are 18 Expanding, 10 Transitioning and 7 
Emerging ELLs. Students will use instructional materials as per their language proficiency level.  
As per our 2017-2018 NYSESLAT results there are 16 students who scored Entering and 27 
Emerging in grades 2-5. Those students and new arrivals will concentrate their after 
school learning  on the USA/NYC geography and the changes NYC has experienced over time 
during the 1600's, 1700's, 1800's and 1900's.

1- ESL instruction for parents: Our ELL parents have expressed an interest in participating in 
ENL classes. “When schools, families, and community groups work together to support learning, 
children tend to do better in school, stay in school longer, and like school more.” That’s the

Part D: Parental Engagement Activities   
conclusion of A New Wave of Evidence, a report from Southwest Educational Development 
Laboratory (2002). As a school that serves many ELLs we recognize the importance of helping 
our parents communicate in English and providing their children with as much assistance as 
possible. We will offer basic ENL lessons to our ELL parents. We hope that these sessions will 
plant the seed for them to continue their education and improve their English Language skills. In 
addition, we hope to provide parents with basic English skills to navigate the system in order to 
be successful in their daily lives, whether it is to purchase a Metro Card, to ask for services in a 
hospital, to do a bank transaction, or to order a meal in a restaurant. Furthermore, one of our 
goals is to help parents familiarize themselves with the USA culture in order to feel a sense of 
belonging, to have a voice and to feel more comfortable with their own communication. Parents 
will also have the opportunity to enroll in Basic Math Instruction.  
The following classes will be provided by our community partner Children's Aid Society at NO 
COST to the program. 
 ENL Basic: Mondays and Wednesdays / 1hr per day; starting October 2018-May 2019 
Math Basic-  Tuesdays and Thursdays , 1hr per day ; Oct 2018-May 2019. 
Basic Technology : Mondays and Wed : 1hr per day; Oct 2018-May 2019  
Citizenship and Nutrition classes on Fridays. Oct 2018-May 2019  
Parents will also have the opportunity to take Zumba, Yoga and Bootcamp classes in order to 
maintain a healthy life style.

After reviewing and analyzing the assessment data, answer the following: 

1.  What formative assessments or curriculum-embedded assessments (e.g., EL SOL, Estrellita, Fountas and Pinnell, DRA, TCRWP, 

teacher-created assessments) are being used to guide instructional planning for your ELLs? 
Fountas and Pinnell in English and Spanish running records are administered at least 4 times throughout the year  in order to 
determine the student’s instructional and independent reading level.  The data acquired from running records allows teachers 
to group ELLs homogeneously by levels and/or reading strategies for guided reading.  This data support ELLS with knowing 
their independent reading levels and help them set goals. Teachers are able to determine instructional next steps, strategies 
and scaffolds to implement with ELLs,  during mini-lessons, guided reading, and/or reading conferences to explicitly teach 
strategies needed for progress.Independent reading conferences are use to assess strengths and teach a specific skill or 
strategy to move that student towards reading grade level text independently. Conferences are also used to provide 
opportunities for oral discourse and language development around the core content.Classroom observations are used daily 
and frequently through out all subject areas. These observations afford teachers the opportunity to make automatic lesson 
adjustments for students who may be struggling and for the ones who are surpassing expectations.   Math Check- in Problems, 
teachers check for understanding by assigning three to four “check in problems” (Basic computational problems that assess 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          70 

 

the concept). Teachers assign problems that provide entry points for ELLs to demonstrate mastery. Teachers use the results to 
adjust instruction, which may be to re-teach the lesson in a different manner if the majority of the students show a lack of 
conceptual understanding or to group those several students that did not understand while the rest of the class moves 
forward.Teachers will ask questions in a sequential manner in order to elicit and assess understanding.Questions will be ask 
from lower- order to higher-order or as Marzano explains, in a series of four phases, “Details, Categories, Elaborations and/or 
Evidence” (Questioning Sequences in the Classroom).This practice will allow teachers to determine which questioning level 
ELLs need help with and plan accordingly.Team talk, answers to questions (close reading, high level questioning, differentiation 
for questioning), students’ reflections. Additionally, teachers provide frequent and relevant feedback during their daily lesson 
implementation by either meeting with students individually or in small-groups. Immediate feedback is provided by the 
teacher as well as classmates as students use group rubrics and task performance rubrics to evaluate their academic 
performance. This feedback help students to self-reflect, adjust and assess their own progress.Teachers also use the 
information gathered to assess students progress in the four modalities, reading, writing, speakimg and listening.  In order to 
determine which areas students need additional assistance. Share Out: At the end of the lesson and/or the period, students 
reflect on their success with the teaching point and/or focus questions for the lesson. This will be done at times orally and 
other times in writing for all subjects.It provides ELLS with an extra opportunity to express themselves orally and in 
writing.Quick writes: Students are ask to write down their understanding for a couple of minutes This will provide ELLs 
additional time to gather their thoughts, a second chance to think about their understanding before sharing with their 
classmates.This will allow teachers to determine the quality/level of the writing the student can produce independently in 
order to explicitly meet the student's needs.Chunking/Annotating: As students read independently they will write down the 
main idea of each paragraph.This will help Students to keep track of the focus of each paragraph and/ or the sequence of 
eventsin order to determine the main idea, central message, or to summarize a text. Chapter & Module Tests: Assessments 
aligned to both the literacy and math curricula are administered in English and or Spanish at the conclusion of each module or 
chapter.  These include both performance based assessments, as well as Chapter/Unit tests.  Teachers collaborate to make 
adjustments to assessments ensuring that they align with the CCLS being addressed within the chapter/unit.  Rubrics are being 
used to calibrate results of student work and are modified accordingly to any adjustments made.  Teachers provide students 
with specific feedback based on the components represented within the rubric After examining the results as a class and as a 
grade, teachers plan lesson adjustments and retaeching that incorporates supplemental materials in order to help their 
students to increase their level of performance. . 
 

2.  What structures do you have in place to support this effort? 

Grade teacher teams meet weekly to collaborate, discuss class trends and effective teaching practices in order to improve 
academic performance for ELLs. Informal students’ observations are an integral part of our assessments of ELLs. These 
observations help the teachers monitor the gradual increase of language development & efforts of our students. Students’ 
efforts are measured informally in situations such as when a student stops depending on the language/ sentence prompts 
provided by the teacher. The students’ usage of syntax & correct grammar when formulating their responses, the usage of 
vocabulary taught in a lesson, Tier 3 vocabulary, either in writing and/ or speaking are also ways in which our teachers 
measure the students’ growth and development of the new language. 
Quick Writes: For a couple of minutes, students are asked to quickly write down their understanding for the reading at 
hand.  This provides ELL’s additional time to gather their thoughts as well as a second chance to think about their 
understanding before sharing with their classmates.  This practice also provides the teachers with the opportunity to clearly 
assess student’s reading comprehension and evaluate whether or not students are using Standard English in their written 
responses. This at the same time will help teachers to plan next steps to help students further improve their reading and 
writing skills. 
 

3.  What summative assessments or baseline/benchmark assessments (e.g., NYC performance Tasks, Performance Series, ELL 

Periodic Assessment, HLA Assessment) are being used to identify baseline, progress and areas of need? 
Renaissance Learning’s STAR Early Literacy, Reading, and Math assessments are utilized  to universally screen our students at 
the beginning, middle, and end of school year (BOY, MOY, EOY).  These assessments are analyzed at the school, grade, class, 
and student levels for a variety of purposes.  School and grade-wide analysis allow school leaders to make strategic decisions 
regarding curriculum and professional development, while class and student level data are used to make instructional 
decisions, such as grouping in the classroom, as well as Response to Intervention decisions for students (Tiers 1, 2, or 3). 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          71 

 

School- and grade-wide standards foci according to STAR MOY data include the following: 
Renaissance Learning program has the mission to help children develop love for reading by motivating reading and increase 
student literacy. Some of its benefits are: 
Just right reading levels (Zone of Proximal Development) 
Individual student’s reading ability and grade equivalent. 
Tracking growth in a consistent manner 
 
At PS 5 we use several components offered by this site: STAR reading, STAR reading Spanish, STAR math, STAR math Spanish 
and STAR Early Literacy in both languages as the Universal Screener to measure students’ progress three times per year. 
STAR reading and STAR Early Literacy is utilized to monitor students’ progress for RtI and to set up individual goals. 
In addition STAR Math and STAR Math Spanish helps us monitor students’ progress in this academic area. 
Renaissance Learning provides the ability to monitor students’ progress through the years as well as to obtain assessment data 
from students transferred to us from schools using this adaptive formative tool.   
There are several teachers who use Math in A Flash in order to provide fluency practice according to each student’s 
ability.  One of the most important advantages of this assessment is the capacity to obtain reports instantly right after 
students are tested.  
 
 
 
 
 

4.  What structures do you have in place to address interventions once the summative data has been gathered?  

Grade teacher team meets once a week and/or during professional development on Mondays to discuss class trends, grade 
trends and adjust instruction.Teachers use the summative data to create math intervention groups, guided reading groups, 
and differentiated tiered groups in writing. 
In literacy when conducting daily guided  reading lessons(during the 2nd period of literacy) students are grouped according to 
reading levels. Teachers review a strategy that will help the students progress in their reading level, listens to students read 
individually, ask questions and provide next steps for students to practice. The teacher frequently does running records to 
determine if child can move to the next level. 
Teachers create flexible groups and use differentiated materials and curricula to target specific pre-requisite skills. Teachers 
use the Ready curriculum as a resource to target ELLs needing remediation in English or Spanish. In addition iReady (computer-
based program) is also used to address the needs of ELLs.     
 

5.  How does your school use data to guide instruction for ELLs within the Response to Intervention (RtI) framework (for grades K-
5). [Refer to ELL Policy and Reference Guide, Support Services for ELLs (RTI and AIS) section and RtI Guide for Teachers of ELLs.]  
Our School-wide universal screener is the STAR Reading (Grades 1-5) and Early Literacy (grade K-2). Students take this 
assessment three times a year. Every 10 weeks, teachers identify their Tier 1 groups, which are comprised of the class’s 
bottom third. Teachers make recommendations for students they believe require Tier II intervention based on all of the data 
they had obtained. The RtI Team meets weekly to consider these recommendations, form groups, and make decisions around 
the research-based programs to be used in Tier II intervention. Tier II intervention teachers use STAR assessment as a progress 
monitoring tool to track student improvement. Adjustments are made to the Tier II intervention if it is observed that students 
stall at increasing their levels (RtI Team). After 20 weeks of Tier II intervention, students are considered for Tier II intervention 
and after this additional 10 weeks of more intense intervention can either continue in Tier III or the school may proceed with a 
special education evaluation. It should be noted for students in TBE classes, the RtI team assesses whether the intervention 
should be delivered in English or the native language. ELL students are included in this process along with school-wide 
population. 
Tier I intervention for our ELL students is given by the classroom teacher. Bottom third students are determined by a 
combination of all dated accumulated such as NYS tests, Renaissance Learning Star assessment, baseline assessment at the 
beginning of the year, running records and class performance. Students at bottom third of the class are entitle to Tier I 
intervention which is deliver in the classroom by the classroom teacher differentiating instruction and modifying or 
accommodating instructional material in the classroom to address students need. If after ten weeks of Tier I the student is not 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          72 

 

showing adequately progress, classroom teacher recommend the student for Tier II. 
Tier II intervention is a more intensive, possibly different treatment, delivered in a small group by trained personnel using 
specialized instructional practices that are scientifically based and include a more frequent progress monitor. Our new comers 
in the transitional bilingual classes receive Tier II intervention in their native language. At this level, progress monitoring is 
done every 2 weeks using the Estrellita RtI assessment and the Renaissance Learning Star assessment which provides with 
information of the critical areas to be targeted for each student. This assessment and the class performance determine 
whether or not the student is making sufficient progress and whether modifications or reductions to the Tier II intervention 
are required. 
Tier III intervention is design for our students who demonstrate insufficient progress in Tier II. At this level, intervention is 
given every day by a highly trained specialist in a homogeneous group of 1:1-1:3.  We monitor the progress of the students in 
Tier III once a week to examine rate and level of performance. All ELLs and students in transitional bilingual classes are 
included in this process. 
The Renaissance Learning Star assessment give us specific information in all of the five pillars of reading (phonological 
Awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary and comprehension) identifying and recommending the skills we need to target for 
individualize instruction based on most recent assessment. Skills recommendations are based on the median score for each 
instructional group. We use these skills as starting point for instructional planning. 
The Estrellita Assessment evaluates the student ability to recognize letter sounds, syllables and words at the kindergarten level 
and sentences at the first grade level. The Estrellita Inventory is used to record the student’s progress.   
 
 

6.  What outcome assessments (e.g., NYSELAT, ELA, Math, Regents) data are used to evaluate and inform your ELL programs? 

([Refer to the ELL Data Analysis Tool and RLAT from ATS].  
  
PS 5 has 275 ELLs from first to fifth grade. They represent 44.6% of our population. The average attendance for all our students 
is 92.6%. The data analysis shows that 17.8% of our ELL population with at-risk factor level 3 or greater. This represents a 5.7% 
decrease when compared to the previous academic year (16-17). There is a 7.6% of ELLs with an at-risk factor level 5 or 
greater. This represents a decrease of 1.2%. The most common at-risk factors are: 
Our tested population has a representation of three home languages – American Sign Language, Chinese and Spanish. There is 
a total of 5 SIFE students. 
NYSESLAT 
When analyzing the NYSESLAT scores of the 238 students who took this assessment in 2017, we find a total of 67 students who 
advanced at least a proficiency level. 
Eighty-five students remained at the same proficiency level. There is a decrease of students who regressed on the NYSESLAT as 
compared to previous administration (2016 – 20 students, 2017 – 16 students). All the students who regressed have the 
commonality of having taken the NYSESLAT at the entry point for a new grade band (1-2 and 3-4). Five of the students who 
regressed were holdovers within past three years. Fifteen students scored commanding (6.3%). 
The modality of strength is speaking. One hundred twenty-eight scored high in it. The second modality is reading with 74 
students, the third one is writing with 41 students and the last one is listening with 34. These results show a tremendous gap 
between the highest modality, speaking, and the lowest one, listening. Listening should be developed across all content areas 
since this is the entry point to acquire a second language. The second strongest modality is reading followed by writing. 
The ELL Data Analysis Tool (EDAT) identifies the following lowest modalities of need by grade: 
In order to increase the Listening component, PS 5 educators use the following strategies: 
Writing component is addressed using the following practices: 
 
When looking across grades and its modalities, grades can be ranked in the following manner (addition of all modalities within 
a grade):

ELLs’ 2017 NYSESLAT Results and NYS ELA Results 
Fifty percent of our ELLs in current grades 4 and 5 obtained level 1 on the NYS ELA. Their NYSESLAT proficiency levels range 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          73 

 

from emerging to commanding. Forty-one percent obtain level 2. Level 2 students on the NYS ELA represent a total of 19 
students. Sixteen students are at the expanding level and three at the commanding level. 
ELLs on the NYS ELA on grade level or above represent about 9%. There are 3 level three (1 expanding and 2 commanding). 
The only ELL found at level 4 obtained commanding proficiency level on the NYSESLAT. 
Out of the total number of students tested on the NYS ELA 2017, 82 % have received ENL services for at least four years. 
The 2017 School Performance Dashboard shows a +0.16 average proficiency increase on the ELA for our school. This is the 
same increase for our district. The City shows a decrease of 0.12 overage proficiency rating for this subgroup on the ELA 
assessment. 
ELLs’ 2017 NYSESLAT Results and NYS Math Results 
Forty-five percent of our ELL population obtained level 1 on the NYS Math Test. Their NYSESLAT proficiency ratings range from 
entering to commanding. 
Level 2 students on the NYS Math test also represent 45%. Their NYSESLAT proficiency ratings also range from entering to 
commanding. The breakdown is as follows: 
Levels 3 and 4 students represent 10% of the ELLs currently in grades 4 and 5. Their NYSESLAT proficiency ratings range from 
transitioning to commanding. 
The 2017 School Performance Dashboard shows a +0.14 average proficiency increase on the Math for our school and +0.19 
increase for our district while the City shows a decrease of 0.23 on average proficiency rating for this subgroup on the Math 
assessment. 
 
NYSESLAT Results and 4th Grade Science 2017 Results 
After analyzing the RLAT and the 2017 4th grade Science results (SCDS), we find that 68 % of our current fourth grade students 
obtain levels 1 or 2. Thirty-two percent of the students obtained levels 3 and 4. 
A hundred percent of former Ells obtained levels 3 and 4 on the last 4th grade Science test. 
During this academic year, the following strategies / interventions are being implemented to support our ELLs: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

7.  What structures do you have in place to disseminate these findings in order to make adjustments to your programs? 

P.S. 5 employs a variety of ways to disseminate the above findings: 
All summative state data is presented during our first PD of the school year in September. Teachers have a chance to analyze, 
discuss our ELL data findings. Also teachers analyze, discuss and compare the findings to the district and the city. 
In September during the professional periods, once a week and or the Monday Professional Development (2:30-4:00 pm), 
teachers meet and make decisions as to how to adjust the math, ELA, Social Studies and Science instruction according to the 
data. For example, after analyzing the ELA June Instructional Report, grade level teams figured out in which standards ELLs 
performed well and which ones they were struggling with. It was decided to shift some of the ELA units, making sure that the 
standards ELLs were struggling with were presented towards the beginning of the school year guaranteeing enough practice in 
order for students to improve their academic performance on those standards. 
In Math, we noted when those particular standards were going to be addressed in the Go Math curriculum and planned 
activities to further consolidate understanding within those target standards, through the problem of the day, group work, as 
well as in fluency.  After examining the item analysis data for the New York State Math Exam in grades 3-5, it has been 
determined that each grade will focus on the specific standards that had a low performance by the students.  Across all 
standards, students struggled with multi-step word problems.  To address this, students have been given a Problem of the Day 
packet that includes multi-step word problems.  Many of these word problems are questions that have been released from the 
state both in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 testing year.  In addition, Operations and Algebraic Thinking, Numbers and 
Operations in Base Ten and Numbers and Operations in Fractions are three areas that 3rd-5th grade teachers are targeting. In 
addition to the Problem of the Day, the math coach is providing teachers with a Word Problem packet that includes 2-step and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          74 

 

 

multi-step word problems that students are working on during their daily lessons targeting the three domain areas.  During 
daily lessons teachers engage the class in practicing skills/strategies identified as a challenge. For example, Math Fluency was 
identified; therefore the math coach created various activities where the class focuses on Math fluency for 7-10 minutes daily. 
RLAT reports are provided to teachers and service providers throughout the year as a result of continuous ELLs enrollment. 
 

 
 
 
Part IV: ELL Programming 
 

Programming and Scheduling Information 

1.  How is instruction for ELLs delivered in the following programs? Include how integrated and standalone ENL are implemented 
as per CR Part 154.2 as well as how students are grouped (e.g., block [class travels together as a group], ungraded [all students 
regardless of grade are in one class], heterogeneous [mixed proficiency levels], homogeneous [proficiency level is the same in 
one class]).  

a.  Freestanding ENL program. 

P.S.5 offers a Freestanding ENL Program using Standalone, Integrated and Pull-Out Model.  We have standalone in 
grades 1st, 4th, and 5th. The ENL Team consists of 2 full time teachers who provide instruction for the remainder of 
ELLs through an Integrated and Pull-out model (Entering/emergent only) or a combination of both.  The students are 
placed in ENL specific programs according to parental choice, NYSITELL, and NYSESLAT results. Classes are formed 
heterogeneously, where students with higher language proficiency serve as language models for those who perform 
at a lower proficiency level. Former ELLs are placed in either a Stand-alone or Integrated model so they can receive 
the mandated support. During the integrated, the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher conduct small group guided 
reading instruction and/or content area instruction. The ENL teacher assists the classroom teacher in scaffolding the 
lesson and front loading the vocabulary. In addition, the ENL and classroom teacher analyzes the NYSESLAT data by 
modality in order to continue developing the listening, speaking, reading and writing skills as needed. We make every 
effort to support all our ELLs by providing them with home language materials, books, dictionaries, glossaries, and test 
translations if needed. 
  

b.  TBE program.  If applicable.   

Our Transitional/Bilingual Program is offered from 1st Grade to 5th. There are 4 Transitional/Bilingual classes: 1 in 
first grd, 1 in 2nd grd, 1 in 3rd grd, and a fourth/fifth grade bridge class. 
P.S. 5 also has 2 Transitional Bilingual Special Education Self-Contained classes: 1class composed of Kindergartens, 1st 
and 2nd grade students and another composed of 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students. 
The students placed in this program are provided with instruction in their home language and English. The percentage 
of language instruction in the home language and the 2nd language is based on the NYSITELL and or the NYSESLAT 
scores. We also consider teacher observations, informal assessments and the number of years the student has been 
in a Transitional/Bilingual Program to determine placement. In Special Education classes the student’s Individual 
Educational Plan (IEP) is also considered when determining the language of instruction. 
The TBE teachers differentiate instruction during the Language Arts block in order to provide instruction that 
addresses a wide range of reading levels and language proficiencies both in English and Spanish. Note that the 
Mathematics language of instruction, Spanish with an English summary is maintained throughout the year for 
students in grades 3-5 since they will be administered the New York State Mathematics Test in the language they are 
most comfortable and proficient in the spring. Students are grouped for mathematics instruction according to grade 
level and language. Therefore, students in these classes have different LAP models within the same class in order to 
meet their particular needs. Social Studies and Science are mostly taught in English with an introduction or a 
conclusion in the NL depending on the lesson and students’ needs. 
In our TBE classes, students in the Entering Level receive 180 min of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated 
ENL/ELA. 
 Students in the Emerging Level receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          75 

 

 

 Students in the Transitioning Level receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA. Students in the Expanding Level receive 
180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA. Students in the Commanding Level receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL in either 
ELA or Content Area. 

c.  DL program.  If applicable.    

In order to close the academic achievement gap of our ELL students, we will be implementing a Spanish Dual 
Language Program starting September 2017 in Kindergarten and adding a grade in subsequent years. As we immersed 
ourselves in various research studies in the acquisition of a second language, it was evident that the students that 
participate in Dual Language Programs surpass the academic achievement of those in Freestanding ENL, TBE and 
Monolingual programs. The Dual language Team based their conclusion on the professional work and or research 
conducted by W.Thomas, V. Collier, S. Soltero, M. Calderon, N. Cloud, F. Genese and E. Hamayan to named a few.    
The language of instruction will alternate every other day within a two week cycle resulting in a 50-50 language 
distribution. For example, 
Group A will receive all instruction in English on Mondays and Spanish on Tuesdays. Group B will receive all instruction 
in Spanish on Mondays and English on Tuesdays. 
The Dual Language class will be comprised of approximately 50% of English Proficient students (EPs) and 50% of 
English Language Learners. We believe that the integration of the EPs and ELLs is of the utmost importance since the 
integrated students will serve as language role models for each other.  
  
   

2.  How does the school ensure the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided according to proficiency levels in each 

program model? 

a.  How are explicit ENL, ELA, and HLA instructional minutes delivered in each program model (see charts 5.1 and 5.2 

below)? 

The school ensures that the mandated number of instructional minutes is provided by following the CR Part 154.2 guidelines. 
The TBE teacher provides the mandated ENL instructional minutes under CR Part 154.2: 
360 minutes per week for Entering and Emerging ELLs and 180 minutes per week for Transitional and Expanding ELLs. 
 Entering ELLs receive 180 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL; 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA; 45 minutes of HLA; and a 
minimum of 90 minutes of Bilingual Content Area Subjects. 
Emerging ELLs receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL; 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA; 45 minutes of HLA and a minimum 
of 90 minutes of Bilingual Content Area Subjects. Transitioning ELLs receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA; 45 minutes of 
HLA; and minimum of 45 minutes of Bilingual Content Area Subjects. 
Expanding ELLS receive 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA; 45 minutes of HLA; and minimum of 45 minutes  of Bilingual 
Content Area Subjects. 
Commanding ELLs receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA/Content Area. The Assistant Principal reviews all classroom 
programs.    
 

3.  Describe how core content is delivered in each program model. Specify language, and the instructional approaches and 

methods used to make content comprehensible to foster language development and meet the demands of the Common Core 
Learning Standards.  
PS 5 is committed to making content and language comprehensible and accessible to our ELLs in the DL, TBE & ENL programs, 
so that they can meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS). This includes implementing the following 
research based instructional shifts in Literacy: balance of informational and literary text; knowledge in the disciplines (Social 
Studies and Science); academic and text based vocabulary (Tier 1 & Tier2 words), close reading of complex (grade level) text; 
text based conversations; depth of knowledge (questioning); speaking, reading and writing grounded in evidence from the 
text. This will be done in a systematic balance literacy method that includes: read aloud, shared reading/close reading, guided 
reading and independent reading, writing workshop. 
In math we are preparing our students in the DL, TBE & ENL programs to meet the demands of the CCLS through the following 
instructional shifts: Focus deeply on concepts that are prioritized in the standards to deepen students understanding of 
mathematics; fostering coherence by connecting the learning across grades for students to build new understandings; building 
fluency with speed and accuracy of skills in order to manipulate more complex concepts; develop a deep understanding by 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          76 

 

finding many ways of arriving to the end results; choose appropriate concepts and apply to “real world” situations; and 
practicing the basic skills and developing deeper understanding of concepts simultaneously.ELLs will demonstrate their ability 
to model with mathematics and/or construct and explore the reasoning behind arguments to arrive at a viable solution. 
Students will be engaged in real world problems that require more than one step in finding the solution. Students will continue 
to develop their skills in communicating their mathematical thinking when working in small groups and sharing the process 
used to solve a specific word problem. ELLs are exposed to grade level/CCLS content in mathematics. During all instruction, 
teachers check for understanding to identify students in need of additional support and/or scaffolding. This is done either 
through small group or one to one instruction. The goal is to move students toward independence. 
In order to make content and language accessible and comprehensible for all students in the DL,TBE &ENL programs, teachers 
implement instructional scaffolds during lessons.  Teachers are focusing in scaffolds provided by Persida and William  Himmele 
in their text The Language Rich Classroom. For example, inorder to develop higher order thinking skills, teachers “Ripple 
Questions”when dealing with open ended questions (pages89-92). ELLs have the opportunity to first respond  to the question 
individually using a quick write. Then ELLs are paired or work in small groups to share their answer and/or adjust it. Lastly the 
pairs or small groups share with the whole class. This scaffolds provide everyone with the time needed to first process the 
information individually and  to have the opportunity to express themselves in alow risk environment.  Another example is, the 
New Vocabulary Log which includes students learning sufix and prefix when learning the meaning of new words.  ELLs  are able 
to figure out the meaning of words using  morphological structures, and context. 
We recognize the importance of practicing accountable talk or instructional conversations to the development of second 
language skills. Accountable talk or instructional conversations provide students with the opportunity to use academic 
language in meaningful ways. These conversations allow students to explore ideas, different perspectives and require them to 
continuously use their text as reference. Ready Gen provides opportunities for team talk in which students have conversations 
based on complex text. Students are trained to go back to the text to find evidence to support their ideas and opinions as 
required by the Common Core Learning Standards (CCLS).Go Math provides time for “Math Talk” which allows students to 
have conversations about the problems they are solving, the different ways to solve them, and the opportunity to prove which 
method is more efficient. It guides the students into deeper thinking about the math they are learning and helps to develop an 
understanding of “why do I need to know this?” and how it affects everyday life. English Language Learners  need explicit 
instruction in expressing themselves orally as well as in writing. It is important for them to recognize the differences between 
conversational, formal spoken and written English in order to improve their English Language skills.Language prompts are 
being introduced to support our students in the DL, TBE & ENL programs when expressing ideas orally or in writing. Our 
students in the DL. TBE & ENL programs  are taught to use prompts or language patterns to express language strategies they 
do not understand, to report in groups or with partners, to report other people’s ideas, and to acknowledge other people’s 
spoken or written ideas. 
We recognize the essential role that academic language plays in the success of our students in the DL, TBE &ENL programs. 
Teachers are developing academic language throughout the day by having instructional conversations as they focus on both 
language and comprehension in all content areas. In all our ELL classrooms, vocabulary is being introduced and reviewed. Tier 
2 and Tier 3 words are being taught in all subject areas. Inorder to acquire a deeper understanding of the above DL, TBE and 
ENL teachers refer to Chapter 2, Developing Academic Language from The Language Rich Classroom by Himmele. 
 The approaches mentioned above will help students unpack the listening/speaking standards thus helping in reading and 
writing as well. At P.S. 5, we recognize the importance of preparing all our students for careers and college readiness; 
therefore Literacy and Mathematics instruction are designed to be rigorous and cognitively challenging. Continued 
professional development will be provided to teachers of students in the DL, TBE & ENL programs in the alignment of ENL 
strategies, the use of the Native Language and the CCLS. 
The following is a specific description of each of our programs: 
Kindergarten Dual Language Program (DL): 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          77 

 

Transitional Bilingual Program (1st): 
 
 
 
 
 
Transitional Bilingual Program (Grades 2-5): 
 
In TBE classrooms the native language is used as a tool to make language comprehensible and teach content. This allows our 
TBE students to transfer skills and concepts taught in the native language to the new language learning. TBE teachers help 
students make connections while also explicitly teaching the skills and concepts that are different in Spanish and English. 
 
 
 
 
Ready CCLS NY: about 6 to 7 units conducted after each Social Studies Unit and Ready Gen Biliteracy Fictional Module. 
 
Writing Fundamentals: Immersion, Narrative, Informational, and Opinion 
 
 
 
Free Standing ENL (Grade 1) 
 
 
Mathematics  Instruction: Math instruction is delivery in English.  In the classroom there are resources in the native language 
in order for students to refer to it if chosen to.  There are two separate periods in the day dedicated to math 
instruction.  Teachers in the ENL program grade 1 are using the Go Math curriculum and using the Ready Instruction 
curriculum as an additional resource. 
 
Free Standing ENL Program (Grades 2-5): 
 
NYC Passport Social Studies units: Informational units. 
 
 
Ready Gen/Biliteracy:  We are focusing on three Biliteracy units . 
 
 
Ready CCLS NY: about 6 to 7 units conducted after each Social Studies Unit and Ready Gen Fictional Module. 
 
Writing Fundamentals four units: Immersion, Narrative, Informational, and Opinion

4.  How do you ensure that ELLs are appropriately evaluated in their home languages throughout the year? 

Transitional Bilingual Program (1-5) 
In the Transitional Bilingual Program teachers make sure that ELL’s are evaluated in their home language (Spanish)  throught 
the year in various ways.   EDEL and Fountas and Pinell running records are administered in Spanish to determine each 
student’s instructional and independent reading level. This data guides teachers’ instruction in order to  meet studensts’ 
needs.  At the same time, this data allows teachers to group students homogeneously for guided reading and to focus on 
specific strategies geared to students’ needs.  This data supports students in knowing their independent reading levels and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          78 

 

helps them set goals.  During the Litecary Block, students are also assessed in their home language since the teachers  confer 
with them as they read indepently helping the teachers to acknowledge students’ strengths and areas of improvement.  This at 
the same time, allows them to  teach a specific skill or strategy to move individual student towards meeting grade level 
standards.  The students  in this program are also administered the CCLS aligned Literacy Performance Tasks in the Home 
Language (Spanish).   The NYC Spanish home language test is used as an informational baseline. In addition we evaluate the 
home language of our TB students using  the Accelerated Reading. Acclerated Reading is a technology based program, its main 
goal is to increase literacy proficiency. The program establishes a reader diagnostic test that asseses reading comprehension 
using instructional levels. 
 
Math instruction is delivered in Spanish and ELLs are assessed in Spanish.  At the beginning of every Go Math chapter, teachers 
utilize the "Show What You Know" diagnostic assessment.  This assessment is used to determine if ELL students need 
intervention for the chapter's prerequisite skills and provides support to assist if they do.  During daily instruction teachers 
utilize the quick check problems in Go Math to determine which students if any, need additional support and pulls them in a 
small group for re-teaching.  This opportunity for re-teaching provides an additional layer of support to the ELL students.  They 
are working in a small group with the classroom teacher. ELLs are also given chapter test and the Math Performance Task in 
the Home Language. TBE teachers also meet as a team to look at Spanish performance tasks and student work. Rubrics are 
used to assess student’s progress towards meeting the standards in reading, writing and/or math.  Teachers note patterns and 
trends to adjust and differentiate instruction. In addition, teachers assess by checking for understanding throughout each 
lesson in order to adjust instruction as needed.   
 
 
Dual Language /Spanish( K) 
DL classes are also administered the CCLS aligned Literacy Performance Tasks in the Home Language (Spanish). Math 
instruction is delivered in Spanish,  DL students  are also given the Math Performance Task in the Home Language.   DL 
teachers also meet as a team  to look at Spanish performance tasks and student work. Rubrics are used to assess student’s 
progress towards meeting the standards in reading, writing and/or math.  Teachers note patterns and trends to adjust and 
differentiate instruction. In addition, teachers assess by checking for understanding throughout each lesson in order to adjust 
instruction as needed.  Teachers also use formative assessments midway and at the end of each unit to assess students’ 
specific knowledge and understanding of content, vocabulary, skills and strategies related to each unit of study in math and 
literacy. We evaluate the home language of our DL students using  the Accelerated Reading. Acclerated Reading is a 
technology based program, its main goal is to increase literacy proficiency. The program establishes a reader diagnostic test 
that asseses reading comprehension using instructional levels. DL students are assesed throughout the year in their home 
language.  Teachers in the DL progams analyze the information provided by the program to provide instruction geared 
specifically to the students’ individual reading ability, fluency and grade equivalent needs.  The  program helps us track qrowth 
in a consistent manner. 
ENL Programs (k-5) 
Teachers in the ENL program do not evaluate the home language of our students. All of the instruction is provided in the new 
language (English). 
 
     
 

5.  How do you differentiate instruction for each of the following ELL subgroups? 

SIFE   

a. 
b.  Newcomer  
c.  Developing   
d. 
e. 

Long Term 
Former ELLs up to two years after exiting ELL status  

SIFE: students receive a 60/40 model for instruction. In our TBE classes in grades 3-5, teachers differentiate instruction 
throughout the day in order to provide instruction that addresses a wide range of reading levels and language proficiencies 
both in English and/or Spanish. The focus on the differentiation during literacy is contingent upon the student’s English 
Proficiency Level, their ENL services are Stand-Alone and Integrated with ELA with additional Home Language Arts and 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          79 

 

Bilingual Content Area Subjects or they receive ENL services that are integrated with ELA. Students are also grouped according 
to academic level and language of instruction in order to address the academic and language needs of these students. Other 
language and instructional accommodations provided include the use of books that contain repetition, enlarged texts (big 
books), intensive literacy development which includes enrichment programs that are aligned to thematic units, Saturday 
Literacy Programs and After-School ELL’s program. In addition to the ENL programs, teachers also scaffold their general 
curriculum lessons to make the content accessible to all students. Scaffolding for SIFE students includes but is not limited the 
use of the Total Physical Response method, the use of many visual scaffolds and manipulatives and realia where possible, 
providing students with graphic organizers at different levels, including basic Venn Diagrams to more complex T-Charts on 
inferring, to help them focus, the use of anchor charts in the classroom to provide ease of access to key information needed 
for understanding lessons and pairing lower English proficiency ELLS with higher English proficiency ELLs to provide positive 
language modeling. Common planning within the grades enables teacher to discuss and consult with another about strategies 
and curriculum approaches that have been implemented successfully for this population. Some assignments and course 
structure may be set as ungraded work so that students can work at their own pace 
 
Newcomers: Newcomer students who are placed in the TBE model receive 60% of instruction in HL and 40% in ENL. In our TBE 
classes in grades K-5, teachers differentiate instruction during the Literacy block in order to provide instruction that addresses 
a wide range of reading levels and language proficiencies both in English and/or Spanish. Students are also grouped according 
to academic level and English Proficiency Level in order to address the academic and language needs of these students. Guided 
reading groups provide instruction using texts at the student’s instructional level. To further develop their language skills, 
students are exposed to programs such as www.starfall.com in the computer lab. Imagine Learning is used with the TBE grades 
2nd-5th to help ELLs with their language and literacy needs. In addition to these ENL programs, teachers also scaffold their 
general curriculum lessons to make the content accessible to all students. Scaffolding for Newcomer students includes but is 
not limited to using the Total Physical Response method, the use of many visual scaffolds and manipulatives and realia where 
possible, providing students with graphic organizers at different levels, including basic Venn Diagrams to more complex T-
Charts on inferring, to help them focus, the use of anchor charts in the classroom to provide ease of access to key information 
needed for understanding lessons and pairing lower English proficiency ELLS with higher English proficiency ELLs to provide 
positive language modeling. 
 
 Developing: ELL Students who fall within this criterion are those who have had 4-6 years of ENL service. For students receiving 
ENL in the self contained or the integrated model, academic intervention teachers use Guided Reading Benchmark and/or 
Leveled Literacy Intervention by Fountas & Pinnell in English. Guided reading groups provide instruction using texts at the 
student’s instructional level. In addition to the ENL programs, teachers also scaffold their general curriculum lessons to make 
the content accessible to all students. While the use of more complex texts and topics are used for Developing ELLs than for 
Newcomers, scaffolding for Developing ELLs includes but is not limited to the use graphic organizers for writing complex essays 
and T-Charts for inferring in a text, the use of anchor charts in the classroom to provide ease of access to key information 
needed for understanding lessons, providing sentence prompts to involve students in complex discussions like “That’s a good 
point, but I disagree because…”, and pairing lower English proficiency ELLs with higher English proficiency ELLs to provide 
positive language modeling. 
 
 Long-Term: Long-Term ELLs will be following the curriculum of the year they are in. We do this by encouraging students to ask 
questions about text by providing opportunities to do group work using the Think-Pair-Share model, provide students with 
various sentence starters for example “I wish I knew more about…I wonder why….I was confused by…”, create vocabulary 
banks that involve important vocabulary needed to understand the lesson, develop a list of cognates in English and Spanish 
and strategies to help recognize cognates, use rubrics and checklists so students know what is expected of them, provide 
outlines and graphic organizers to help organize and structure student writing. 
 
Former ELLS: Our mandated former ELLs students remain in the ENL program,  in  an integrated model for 2 years following 
the school year in which the student exited from ELL status. Former ELLs receive a minimum of 90 minutes of ENL per week for 
two years. Former ELLs are involve in small group discussion routines that encourage discussion and helps to develop a deeper 
understanding. The small group discussion includes group roles, such as: group organizer, fact checker, clarifier, elaborator, 
summarizer and reporter. Also book clubs are conducted to build understanding of genre structure, participate in thoughtful 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          80 

 

conversations grounded around one book title or theme and engage in critical thinking. Students use rubrics and checklists to 
know what is expected of them in literacy and in math. 
 
 
 

6.  What instructional strategies and grade-level materials do teachers of ELL-SWDs use that both provide access to academic 

content areas and accelerate English language development?  
ELLs with Special Needs: Bilingual Special Education certified teachers  and ENL certified teachers use Common Core aligned 
curriculum and materials. In addition, ENL methodologies, as well as a variety of instructional accommodations are integrated 
into the daily lessons. By having an awareness of the learning needs of the ELL-SWDs, the teacher is able to modify instruction 
to address the student’s individual needs. These accommodations and modifications are integrated and implemented 
throughout the day via teacher led direct instruction.  The Ready Gen and “Go Math” programs include lesson 
accommodations for ELLs, as well as struggling students or students with special learning needs. Classroom teachers design 
their instruction along the suggested lesson guidelines presented in the Teacher’s Manual and then modify the lesson to the 
student’s individual needs. In addition, where grade appropriate, a variety of supplemental materials are available for the 
teachers to use to further build the English vocabulary of the ELL-SWD such as picture cards, big books and audio tapes.    
  
Bilingual special education personnel/service providers who are credentialed and knowledgeable of Second Language Learners 
and ENL methodologies are available to consult with the classroom teacher on possible strategies that can be used to enhance 
the learning of the ELL-SWD population. For example, the Bilingual Speech & Language teacher is available to provide 
strategies on language acquisition for native Spanish speakers as well as Second Language Learners.  
  
The school also utilizes the resources of the other related service providers, to provide direct or indirect support to both the 
classroom teachers as well as ELL students to enhance learning. For example, the Occupational therapist (OT) has flexibility in 
their scheduling for consultation in sharing strategies to modify instruction and break down activities into smaller, discrete 
chunks if needed.  The OT may provide recommendations and assist with modification of materials to teachers of ELL-SWD 
students (consultative services) for students who require assistance.  For example, using a slant board, varying seating or other 
environmental changes, providing pencil grips, using modified lined paper or modifications to worksheet, copying demands, 
etc.  Multiple entry points are designed to help students maximize their academic performance. The Administration, school–
based Support Team, IEP Teacher, Special Education teachers and service providers monitor the services of our special needs 
population  
    
 

7.  How does your school use curricular, instructional, and scheduling flexibility to enable ELL-SWDs to achieve their IEP goals and 

attain English proficiency within the least restrictive environment? 
The diverse need of ELL's who are also Students with Disabilities are met  by making curricular, instructional and schedule 
flexibility decisions  that will allow  them to achieve their IEP goals and attain English Language Proficiency  in the least 
restrictive environment that adhere to certain guidelines. For example,   PS 5 adheres to intervention practices as that are 
implemented after having thoroughly reviewed students’ IEP as well as current language proficiency. Next, the school 
determines how to support these students in the least restrictive environment by considering   assessment scores, review 
of  Response to Intervention (RTI) implementation  and  Language Allocation policy  procedures.  Instruction delivery is 
followed using RTI and it’s three-tier model: 
 1. Tier I intervention involves the classroom teacher, ENL, SETSS ( Special Education Teacher Support Service)and /or related 
service  personnel differentiating instruction and modifying/accommodating instructional materials in the classroom to 
address student needs. Student progress is tracked using various forms of assessments which begin with our universal 
screener, running records and curriculum based assessments.  
2. Tier II intervention involves the provision of small group instruction by one or all the personnel included above, only this 
time, instructional approaches include using specialized instructional practices that are scientifically based and include 
progress monitoring 
3. Tier III includes more intensive and direct individualized instruction by specialized personnel using scientifically based 
remedial system that includes progress monitoring. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          81 

 

 After carefully monitoring the students’ data to determine progress or lack thereof,  the school team, including parent (s), 
decides  the next steps to be followed.  If it is determined that all available support has been provided, included those 
stipulated on the IEP, a meeting to discuss the need to re-evaluate the students to determine whether additional services may 
be need will followed.   Regular revisits and data meetings allow for adaptations of intervention prior to a referral. When 
exhausting all options and determining that the ELL student requires a referral for possible Special education services, a 
thorough and comprehensive bilingual evaluation is conducted that includes, but is not limited to: the teacher referral, review 
of student data, school records/history, and a social history intake with the parent, a classroom observation, and a psycho-
educational evaluation. During the IEP meeting, program recommendations are made after considering the ELL's needs and 
how they may be addressed within the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). 
 PS 5 has Integrated Co-Teaching (ICT) classes in grades K,1,2,3, 4 & 5, consistent with the federal mandates of the Least 
Restrictive Environment (LRE). These programs are designed by incorporating high performing students into the general 
education population, as peer models for our Students with a Disability (SWD).  In addition, consistent with the NYSESLAT and 
the LAP guidelines, all identified and eligible ELL-SWD are integrated into their appropriate ICT or the 12:1:1 program, where 
instruction is conducted in English with ENL support services.  The classroom teachers and ENL providers also have access to 
additional information of the SWD’s by means of the IEP, as available electronically via the Special Education Student 
Information System (SESIS).   In addition, to assist all personnel involved in understanding each student’s goals classroom 
teachers are part of the IEP team where the psychologist, social worker, service providers, parent, a special education teacher, 
a district representative (administrator) and a parent representative create long term goals and program recommendations as 
per IEP. Often, our SWD requires multiple related services such as; Speech & Language Therapy, Occupational and/or Physical 
Therapy and/or Counseling. Therefore, the ENL teacher uses a push-in model to maximize instructional time in the classroom. 
    
 

8.  Describe your targeted intervention programs for ELLs in ELA, math, and other core content areas (specify ELL subgroups 

targeted).  List the range of intervention services offered in your school for the above areas as well as the language(s) in which 
they are offered. 
The following instructional practices are consistent throughout the school in order to support ELL students in English and/or 
Native Language Arts: reading, writing, speaking and listening. 
Reading: During our literacy block, teachers provide explicit teaching instruction that allows students to participate in a variety 
of literacy activities, including the following: close reading, text based vocabulary instruction, text based conversations (team 
talk), reading analysis instruction (character development, setting), etc.  P.S. 5 is committed to making content and language 
comprehensible and accessible to our Ells so that they can meet the demands of the Common Core Learning Standards 
(CCLS).  This includes implementing the following research based instructional shifts in Literacy: balance of informational and 
literary text; knowledge in the disciplines (Social Studies and Science); academic and text based vocabulary; close reading of 
complex (grade level) text; text based conversations; depth of knowledge (questioning); speaking, reading and writing 
grounded in evidence from the text.  In addition, to both motivate and assess student independent reading students take 
reading quizzes through the online Accelerated Reader (from Renaissance Learning). 
In order to provide more individualized instruction teachers are using the results of the  STAR Reading and Early Literacy 
Assessment to group students.  Students take a base-line, mid-year and end-of-year literacy assessment, on the computer. This 
assessment is used as a universal screener for RTI. Classroom Teachers review the data and make decisions as to which 
students should receive Tier I intervention.  These groups are provided with targeted skills that the teacher addresses during 
guided and/or independent reading.  Teachers are able to obtain various types of reports such as the “Summary Report” that 
provides information on instructional reading level (guided reading level) and the zone of proximal development (ZPD), which 
is a range of  reading levels for independent reading practice.  Teachers also use other sources of data, such  as the Fountas 
and Pinnell running records  to inform their instruction.  
 
TIER 2 Intervention 
Students receiving Tier II  intervention  meet with the intervention teacher three times per week in groups of 5-6, for sessions 
of 20-40 minutes, during 6-10 week cycles.  Instruction focuses on the 5 pillars of reading, phonemic awareness, phonics, 
fluency, vocabulary and comprehension. Tier I intervention continues in the classroom,  provided by the classroom teacher. 
The STAR assessment is used for progress monitoring for Tier II intervention. r 
 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          82 

 

 The Estrellita program is a supplementary, accelerated, beginning Spanish reading program .  We use it for bilingual students 
in grades K-2.  It provides multi-sensory instruction in phonemic awareness, phonics and fluency.   The Estrellita program is 
utilized across Tiers 1,2 and 3.  Progress monitoring is being conducted approximately every two weeks.  Spanish Guided 
Reading Intervention-Benchmark Program is utilized with students in grades 3-5. The Star assessment in Spanish is administer 
for progress monitoring.   At the present time 23 Bilingual students are receiving Tier II intervention in Native Language Arts. 
Out of those 23, two students are SWD’s. Bilingual students are being serviced by two bilingual teachers. 
 
TIER 3 Intervention 
More intense intervention will be provided to students after a minimum of 20 weeks of Tier 2 intervention.  Groups will consist 
of 1-2 students, for 45 minutes, five times a week.  Programming will focus on the five pillars of reading, using a research-
based program with progress monitoring for at least 10 weeks. 
 
Writing: Writing skills and strategies are targeted during the Fundamentals of Writing Writer’s Workshop mini-lesson and 
during individual student conferencing.  During mini-lessons students are exposed to mentor texts providing models of writer’s 
craft and structural elements of writing.  During each unit of study students work through the writing process and publish a 
final piece of writing (50% literary and 50% informational) that aligns with the CCLS.  Students write reflections about 
themselves as learners in reading, writing and math.  Teachers use  rubrics to determine the students’ levels of progress and 
next steps in writing.   
Math 
All classes are using the Go Math! Program in English and/or Spanish.  In addition to providing math instruction, the program 
provides enrichment, differentiated instructional options for our ELL students, intervention strategies and games to address 
the needs of our students on a daily basis. The Go Math! Curriculum provides RtI intervention that can be done immediately in 
the classroom.  The program is designed to provide intervention on a daily basis to students who didn’t grasp the concept of 
the lesson and provide Tier I intervention in the classroom.  The curriculum also provides Tier II and Tier III intervention for 
students who need more support in the daily lessons.  Many of these students are our ELLs.  The tiered intervention lessons 
provide visual models as well as hands-on, kinesthetic approaches to the content being taught.  Manipulatives and a rich 
interactive on-line component also provide support for our ELLs.  Students are challenged with the demands of the CCLS 
mathematical shifts through Higher Order Thinking problems on a daily basis that encourage students to apply mathematical 
concepts in a “real world” situation.  This provides a different entry point that many of our ELLs can use to access the 
content.    
Each classroom teacher has a math center to integrate literacy and mathematics instruction.  The teachers have interactive 
word walls that include math vocabulary from books read from their center and from their daily instruction.  The teachers are 
also working on increasing the amount of writing our students are producing in math.  Students must reflect on the process 
used to solve a problem and explain their mathematical thinking.  The writing reflections help the students to deepen their 
understanding and to internalize the content.  It also serves as an informal assessment for the teachers in order to enhance 
their instruction.   
We have a bridge bilingual class of 4th and 5th grade students.  The classroom teacher provides the core math instruction to 
the 5th graders and one of our  Science Cluster teacher provides the core math instruction to the 4th graders.  The 
intervention teacher has a bilingual license and is using the 5th grade Go Math! Curriculum in Spanish.   
Content areas:  Language is a focus through all content areas.  Teachers are introducing different types of language frames in 
order to help our students increase their oral and written communication skills, and communicate effectively in social and 
academic setting.   In addition, writing instruction is being linked with Social Studies and/or Science to maximize academic and 
linguistic development and transfer of skills in both languages. .  Furthermore, we implement a Science after school program 
open to grade 4 students enabling them to practice and reinforce concepts and stimulate their scientific thinking.  Bilingual 
students that participate will receive instruction in Spanish. 
  
  
Social Emotional Component: 
In order to address the socio-emotional aspect of our students’ education ( ESL standard  5) the following programs are  being 
implemented: 
 RULER  Emotional Intelligence: A crucial area in the education of our children is to help them develop the emotional strength 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          83 

 

and perseverance needed for academic and personal  success. “A recent meta analysis of research on programs focused on 
social and emotional learning, (SEL) shows that a systematic process for promoting students’ social and emotional 
development is the common element among schools that report an increase in academic success, improved quality of 
relationships between teachers and students, and a decrease in problem behavior (Durlak, Weissberg, Dymnick, Taylor, and 
Schellinger, 2011).”  Towards that end we have acquire the RULER Program which stand for R recognizing emotions; U 
understanding emotions; L labeling emotions; E expressing emotions and R regulating emotions.  Our two Assistant Principals 
attended a 4 day intensive training during the summer month at Yale University and are currently involve in obtaining 
certification for the RULER program.   Both Assistant Principals have already conducted several sessions in which the entire 
staff has participated.  Hence providing teachers with the skills and coping strategies to model in order for  their students to 
practice and acquire the emotional skills needed to succeed. PS 5 is committed to educating the “whole child”; therefore we 
will continue training all stakeholders on the RULER approach during the school year.  
Children’s Aid Society:   Our founding lead partner, bases their support on a “developmental triangle”.  This calls for a strong 
instructional program, expanded learning opportunities through enrichment, and services designed to remove barriers of 
children’s learning and healthy development.  The program runs 5 days a week from 2:20-5:00pm.   
  
 
 

9.  Based on data and trends, what new programs or improvements will be considered for the upcoming school year?    

A Kindergarten Dual Language Program will be implemented starting September 2017. 
 
Math: 
In order to close the achievement gap among ELLs we will use a combination of Go Math and Ready during the math 
instruction. Both materials are available in English and Spanish. 
 
 
 

10.  If you had a bilingual program, what was the reason you closed it? 

We have not closed a bilingual program. 
 

11.  How are ELLs afforded equal access to all school programs?  Describe after school and supplemental services offered to ELLs in 

your building. 
ELLs participate in Children’s Aid Soiciety after school, Title III, Math Saturday, ELA after school,  Spring & Winter Math & ELA 
programs. Applications, invitations, registrations forms, permission slips for these programs are written in the parents’ 
preferred language of communication. These invitations/applications  are sent home via backpack.  In the event that a specific 
parent is interested in the aforementioned programs, they are required to return the signed permission slips. Also phone calls 
are made notifying parents of the availabilities of these programs. Children’s Aid Society provides an after-school program that 
offers extracurricular activities to our ELL population. Title III after school program offers academic support (through New York 
City Passport Social Studies) as well as the integration of the arts in the Home Language and/or English depending on the 
child’s proficiency level.A Math Saturday Program provides ELLS with foundational math support from October-April.ELA after 
school program provides extra support in ELA strategies to our ELLs.. Spring and Winter Holiday Programs in ELA/Math assist 
ELLs in improving their academic performance.  Our founding lead partner, bases their support on a “developmental 
triangle”.  This calls for a strong instructional program, expanded learning opportunities through enrichment, and services 
designed to remove barriers of children’s learning and healthy development.  The program runs 5 days a week from 2:20-
5:00pm.   
 
Title III Hope Academy (Higher Order Performing ELLs) 
Through the After-school program  (Wednesday -Thursday 2:30 -4:00pm and Saturday (9am-12pm) funded through Title III 
funds, ELLs will have the opportunity to strengthen both Native and English Language skills in Listening, Speaking, Reading and 
Writing throughout all content areas. Students work in small groups according to academic and language needs. Teachers will 
integrate the Social Studies Content through NYC Passport , Literacy Program with the arts. Classroom educators and teaching 
artists collaborate on devising and facilitating units of study that challenge students to construct increasingly complex 
understanding associated with academic studies.  Furthermore, students will develop their academic and text based

13.  How is home language support assessed and delivered in each program model (DL, TBE, and ENL)? 

Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE):  Our Transitional/Bilingual Program is offered from first to Grade 5.  The students placed 
in this program are provided with instruction in their home language (Spanish) and English.  The percentage of language 
instruction in the home language and the 2nd language is based on the NYSITELL and the NYSESLAT scores. We also consider 
teacher observations, informal assessments and the number of years the student has been in a Transitional/Bilingual 
Program.  The Language of Instruction in our two Bilingual Special Education classes is individually determined by the student’s 
Individual Educational Plan (IEP) and NYSESLAT scores. The TBE teachers differentiate instruction during the Language Arts 
block in order to provide instruction that addresses a wide range of reading levels and language proficiencies both in English 
and Spanish. Note that the Mathematics language of instruction, either Spanish or English, is maintained throughout the year 
for students in grades 3-5 since they will be administered the New York State Mathematics Test in the language they are most 
comfortable and proficient in the spring.  Students are grouped for mathematics instruction according to grade level and 
language.  Therefore, students in these classes have different LAP models within the same class in order to meet their 
particular needs. 
In our TBE students in the Entering Level receive 180 min of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA. Students 
in the Emerging Level receive 90 minutes of Stand-Alone ENL and 180 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA. Students in the 
Transitioning Level receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL/ELA. Students in the Expanding Level receive 180 minutes of 
Integrated ENL/ELA. Students in the Commanding Level receive 90 minutes of Integrated ENL in either ELA or Content Area. 
In the ENL program  even though all the instruction is in English, every effort is made to provide ELLs with materials written in 
the home language, books, dictionaries, glossaries, and test translations if needed. 
 

14.  Explain how the school ensures all required services/resources support and correspond to ELLs’ ages and grade levels.  

During the integrated time, the classroom teacher and the ENL teacher conduct small group guided reading instruction and/or 
content area instruction.  The ENL teacher assists the classroom teacher in scaffolding the lesson and front loading the 
vocabulary.  During stand-alone time the ENL teacher reinforces concepts and/or strategies covered in the classroom.  All 
materials are age and grade level appropriate. For example big books are use in grades k-2.  Ready NY CCLS Math and ELA 
materials are use in grades 2-5. 
 

15.  If your school shares a building (collocation), how do you share resources and/or coordinate efforts to ensure that all of the 

ELLs’ needs (academic, linguistic, socioemotional) are met?   
We do not share our building with other schools. 
 

16.  Describe activities in your school that assist newly enrolled ELLs before the beginning of the school year. Include activities for 

new ELLs who enroll throughout the school year. Include titles of school staff involved in such activities (e.g., school counselor, 
parent coordinator).  
At the beginning of the year Newly Arrived ELL’s get a tour of the school provided by the ENL teachers (out of the classroom 
personnel,) Counselor and/or Parent Coordinator.The ELL’s that are enrolled throughout the year, along with the ones 
registered in September, are given the opportunity to attend our HOPE academy (Title 3), Math Saturday Academy, the Choir, 
Children’s Aid After School Program.Newly Arrived in grades 3-5 receive additional support to develop their Basic Support Skills 
in their new language. 
 

17.  What language electives are offered to ELLs?  

At the present time we do not offer any language electives to ELLs.    
 

18.  For schools with dual language programs: 

a.  What dual language model is used (e.g., side-by-side, self-contained)? Explain how much of the instructional day 

(percentage) EPs and ELLs are integrated. 
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 

b. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          86 

 

 

c.  How is each language separated for instruction? 
d. 

Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught at the same 
time (simultaneous)? 

  
a. What language model is used?  Explain how much of the instructional day               (percentage) English 
Proficient Students and English Language Learners is integrated. 
 We will be implementing a Side by Side Dual Language Model Program in September 2017 by an 
alternating full day two week cycle resulting in a 50-50 language distribution. The Dual Language class 
composition will be comprised of approximately 50% English Proficient students and 50%English 
Language Learners. We believe that the integration of the EPs and ELLs is of the utmost importance since 
the integrated students will serve as language role models for each other.  Therefore, we will ensure that 
Eps and ELLs are equally integrated in both classes. 
  
In which language(s) is each core content area taught? 
B.  The Kindergarten Dual Language Program will teach each core content area by alternating target 
language as follows: 
Week One :  Monday-English, Tuesday-Spanish, Wednesday-English, Thursday-Spanish , Friday-English. 
Week two: Monday-Spanish, Tuesday-English, Wednesday-Spanish, Thursday-English, Friday-Spanish. 
This model ensures an equal fifty-fifty status of language use throughout the program.  In the event of a 
school holiday, the target language used will be adjusted to maintain continuity of alternating languages. 
 
How is each language separated for instruction? 
C. Each language will be separated for instruction as outlined in the 2 week cycle schedule in Part b. 
During targeted language days fidelity to language will be strictly maintained. 
 
d. Is emergent literacy taught in the child’s home language first (sequential), or are both languages taught 
at the same time (simultaneous)? 
D.Emergent Literacy will be taught in both languages, English and Spanish (simultaneous), in both 
classrooms following the designated language according to the alternating days schedule for Week 1 and 
Week 2.  
  
  
 

Professional Development and Support for School Staff 

1.  Describe the professional development plan for all ELL personnel at the school. (Include all teachers of ELLs and non-pedagogic 

staff.)  What professional development is offered to teachers of ELLs (including ENL and bilingual teachers) in supporting ELLs 
as they engage in the Common Core Learning Standards? 
P.S. 5 is a professional learning community that values life-long learning.  We share a collective focus on student achievement, 
and regularly engage in reflective dialogue, collaborative planning, and welcome transparency in practice.  Teachers’ planning 
will strategically provide opportunities for independent practice and instructional supports during lessons, with the aim of 
building students’ persistence through new or challenging tasks.  Professional development is provided in numerous formats,

TBE and ENL teachers participate  in all of these models alongside their monolingual general education and Special Education 
colleagues.  They are also afforded opportunities to meet as a cohort to participate in a book club,  The Language-Rich 
Classroom, A Research-Based Framework for Teaching English Language Learners. In this book, the authors Persida and 
William Himmele present a five-part, research-based framework-CHATS- that teachers can use to help ELLs, as well as other 
students, improve their language skills and attain deeper content comprehension.  This is a field tested framework that 
includes diagnostic tools, comprehensive overview of second-language acquisition, and teaching techniques to boost language 
learning in any classroom. The Assistant Principal Supervising ELLS will continously check workshops offered by The Division of 
English Language Learners and Stiudents Support and MFSC to update to ensure that biligual teavhers, ENL teachers and non-
ElL teachers receive the required professional development hours that must be dedicated to language acquisition in alignment 
with core content area instruction, including a focu on best practices for co-teaching strategies and intergrating language and 
content instruction for ELLs.   C=Content reading strategiesH=Higher-order thinking skills,A=Assessment tools,T=Total

Parental Involvement 

1.  How does the school provide annual individual meetings with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language 
development progress, language proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all content areas? 
Include provisions for interpretation and translation as needed. Note these meetings do not include mandated parent 
orientation meetings and DOE-scheduled parent-teacher conferences?  
The DOE has designated every Tuesday (At PS 5 2:20-3:00 pm) afternoon as Parent Engagement.  Classroom teachers as well as 
ENL teachers will meet with parents of ELLs to discuss goals of the program, language development progress, language 
proficiency assessments results, and language development needs in all content areas.  Bilingual staff is available for 
translation.  Also the NYC Translation and Interpretation Unit will be contacted when needed. Sign Language interpreter is also 
schedule during EPC's, meetings and events,for the family that needs that service. Monthly class parent sign in sheets will be 
kept in a binder in the main office.  If any parent cannot make it during that designated time, teachers and school staff will 
reach out to parents to find a time that is suitable for them to meet. In the event that parents are not able to make it to the 
school for a meeting, phone conference meetings with translation services are offered to parents. Teachers and staff make all 
necessary accomodations for opportunities to engage with parents and families of students.       

 

2.  Describe ELL parent involvement in your school. Include specific activities that foster parental involvement for parents of ELLs. 

The parent coordinator is a valuable part of our school community. The parent coordinator serves as a Liasion connecting 
the  parents and staff of the school. In this role, she is able to hear concerns and interests of the parents, understand 
expectations of the school and seek out opportunities for workshops and community connections that empower and inform 
parents. We recognize the importance of parental involvement to the academic success of our ELLs.  Parents are an integral 
part of our learning community.  Parents here at PS 5 serve as leaders on school teams such as the School Leadership Team 
(SLT), Parent/Teacher Association (PTA) and Language Allocation Policy (LAP) team.  On these teams, parents assist in 
developing the Comprehensive Educational Plan (CEP) whose goals are focused on the academic and social success of all our 
ELLs.  On these teams, parents share their perspectives, help in the decision making process, and help implement plans that 
affect our school community.  Specifically, parents are involved with decisions that are designed to ensure that the academic 
and social needs of ELL students are addressed.  In addition, Parent Orientation sessions are held for all parents at the 
beginning of the school year and on a needs basis as new entrants are registered.  Meetings are offered during the day and in 
the evening, giving the opportunity for working parents to become active participants.  All meetings are offered in the parents’ 
native language (Spanish) and written materials are provided in Spanish, Arabic, and other languages as needed.  As a 
community school, we partner with Children’s Aid Society in offering our parents different opportunities to get 
involved.  Parents attend classes to learn English as a Second Language and also participate in yoga, zumba and technology 
workshops.  
 
Under Title III ELL  parents participated in ENL classes after school while their children also participated in their Title III after 
school program. 
 
Literacy Inc parents and Teachers to Support Young Readers 
This project aims to engage parents and families in their child's successful reading development in a way that complements the 
school curriculum and creates a literacy-rich home environment.  Increase K-2 grader literacy achievement through better 
parent and community engagement that supports positive reading behavioprs and attitudes. 
 
 
Parent Volunteers 
Our school also has an active parent volunteer program in which parents assist in classrooms and with a variety of activities 
(such as a.m. line up, picture day, book fair, trips, assemblies, dismissal, etc.) that help our school community.

In accordance with New York State’s Commissioner’s Regulations Part 154 as outlined and implemented in the New York City’s ELL 
Policy and Reference Guide, I, Christopher Anest, testify that the following ELL identification procedures and activities are 
adhered to and staff are trained on the following: 
 
1. 

The ELL Identification Process is completed for each student within 10 school days of enrollment (20 school days for 
students entering with IEPs). 
Enrollment status of each newly admitted student is determined 
a. 

If student has been in NYS public schools within past 2 years, our school contacts previous school to obtain ELL status 
relevant assessment scores, and proficiency level.  

The home language of the student is determined by a trained and licensed pedagogue.   
a.  The parent completes the Home Language Identification Survey in the parent’s preferred language; translation services 
are provided by a bilingual staff member, the DOE’s over-the-phone translation services, or an alternative, high quality 
translation service.   

Eligibility for the NYSITELL is determined.   
a. 

If the newly enrolled student is entering with an IEP, the school’s Language Proficiency Team (LPT) recommends eligibility 
to the principal, who obtains final approval from the superintendent. 

Student is administered the NYSITELL, if eligible.   
Parent notification letters are sent to the parent in the parent’s preferred language.  
a.  Parent is notified of their child’s ELL status. 
If the student is identified as an ELL and the student’s home language is Spanish, the student is administered the Spanish 
LAB.  
Student with interrupted/inconsistent formal education (SIFE) status is determined using New York State’s resources 
available on NYSED’s website: http://www.nysed.gov/bilingual-ed/schools/students-interruptedinconsistent-formal-
education-sife.  
If student is an ELL, parent is invited to the parent orientation meeting.  
a.  Parent orientation meeting provides parents with an explanation of each ELL program models offered in NYC; the parent 

video describing the three programs is presented (in parent’s preferred language); parents are encouraged to ask 
questions so that they are informed about all ELL programs; translation and interpretation services are provided 
throughout the meeting. 

10.  ELL is placed in the ELL program that the parent selected.  

a. 

b. 

If the ELL program that the parent selected is not available, the parent is offered a transfer to a school with that program 
in accordance with DOE transfer policies. 
If the ELL remains in the school, the ELL is placed in English as a new language and our school keeps track of parent 
choice so that when minimum thresholds are met, we can open the ELL program of choice.   

11.  Parents are notified that they have 45 days to appeal the ELL status of their child (ELL Reidentification Process).  
12.  If the ELL Reidentification Process is implemented for any student, the principal reviews the decision of any student whose 

ELL status was changed because of the ELL Reidentification Process within 6 to 12 months.

School Goal: To ensure that parents whose preferred language is other than English are provided with meaningful 
opportunities to participate in and have access to programs and services critical to their child’s education (Chancellor's 
Regulation A-663).  
 
By developing each of the following components, your school will have a comprehensive plan to provide translation and 
interpretation services for all parents that cannot communicate in English (not just parents of ELL students). 
 
Part A:  Identification and Assessment of Parents that Cannot Communicate in English 
 
1.  Describe the data and methodologies used to assess language preferences of the parent community for both written 

and oral communication. Include pertinent information culled from: 

  Part III of the Home Language Identification Survey (HLIS) 
  Automate The System (ATS) reports 
  Student Emergency Contact cards 
  Surveys conducted by your school. 

 

We tallied Part 3 of the Home Language Survey and found that: 

34% of parents prefer written communication in English 

65% of parents prefer written communication in Spanish 

0.3% of parents prefer written communication in Chinese. 

2018-19 CEP                                                                                                                                                                                          93 

 

0.15% of parents prefer written communication in Bengali 

34% of parents prefer oral communication in English 

65% of parents prefer oral communication in Spanish. 

0.3% of parents prefer oral communication in Chinese. 

0.15% of parents prefer oral communication in Bengali 

 

Also teachers collect qualitative data as they communicate with parents.  

A requirement under No Child Left Behind is that schools communicate with parents in their primary languages. 
Chancellor's Regulation A-663 ensures that parents are provided with a meaningful opportunity to participate and 
have access to programs and services critical to their child's education. 

All written information from this school is disseminated in both English and Spanish at all times. Oral translation is 
provided in Spanish at all times.  

The Home Language Survey data (Part 3), and the students' emergency contact cards, are used to assess the 
school’s translation and interpretation needs. Accommodations are made for families of other languages spoken 
through the Translation and Interpretation Unit for oral and written translations. Staff also attempts to 
communicate with families that speak other languages. Translator is paid to translate at every monthly PTA 
meeting. during Parent Teacher Conferences arrangements are made for personnel to translate or translators are 
hired to do the translation.   

Parents complete the NYC DOE Parent/Guardian Home Language Survey with a pedagogue present during the 
individual meeting.. Upon completion of this form, this school makes the necessary and appropriate 
arrangements to identified parents and guardians in need of written and oral translation either by using available 
resources provided by the Department of Education's Translation and Interpretation Unit, or by soliciting parent 
and/or staff volunteers who can serve as translators and interpreters. 

 

 
 
2.  List parents’ preferred languages for both written and oral communication. List ALL languages, including English, 

which are represented in your school community. This information can be found in the Parent’s Preferred Language 
Report (RCPL) ATS report.

3.  Describe your school’s communication strategy to reach families that cannot communicate in English in the event of 

a school emergency.  
 

In the event of school emergency our non-English speaking parents are reached via phone calls in their preferred 
language of communication. Also robocalls are done in both English & Spanish. The American Sign Language family 
gets a text that provides information regarding the emergency. Google translation are made to communicate with the 
Chinese family..
